Reflecting on his early years in the league, Javie told Sports Illustrated in October 2000, \"I'd get so mad I'd lose control for two or three minutes, and that's when I would miss calls.\" Javie developed mentorships with referees Joe Crawford and Jack Madden to assist in the maturation process. Working his debut game with Crawford at the Pontiac Silverdome in Detroit, Michigan, Javie received a grade of 40 points out of 100 by supervisor Darell Garretson. While reviewing game film later at the hotel, Crawford noted errors made throughout the game by himself. As a result of this film study, Javie learned that experienced officials make mistakes and admitting error will improve a referee's ability in the long-term. Ninety minutes after the conclusion of a game, Javie reviews game film. In addition to film review, Madden taught Javie not to lose focus when players and coaches were upset, and to walk away from them rather than becoming angry. Javie credited his mentors for success as a referee saying, \"My mentors have made me what I am today. I'm a little part of each of them. It's their success in teaching me.\" Javie had an on-court incident during the 1990\u201391 NBA season in a game between the Portland Trail Blazers and Washington Bullets. Bullets' forward Pervis Ellison threw the ball at referee Billy Spooner prompting Javie to run across the court to impose a technical foul on Ellison. In the sequence of events that followed, Javie ejected Ellison after protesting the call, the Bullets' head coach Wes Unseld for protesting the dismissal of Ellison, and the Bullets' mascot, \"Hoops\", for making gestures to incite the crowd. Rod Thorn, then the NBA's vice president for operations, ruled that Javie overreacted in ejecting Ellison and would be subject to discipline. The extent of the disciplinary action was not disclosed. Javie reflected on the experience saying, \"My fatal mistake was getting involved with Billy [Spooner] and Pervis [Ellison] in the first place. You have to be there for your partners, but most of the time you've got to let them call their game.\" Nearly three years later in another game involving the Portland Trail Blazers, Trail Blazers radio broadcast analyst Mike Rice was ejected by Javie for disputing calls from his broadcast position. During the 2002\u201303 NBA season, Javie was fined \\$1,000 by the league for a verbal altercation with Pat Riley, then-head coach of the Miami Heat. In April 2003, Javie was the referee in Michael Jordan's final game of his fifteen-year NBA career. During a game break towards the end of regulation, Javie congratulated Jordan on his career and told him he was a \"class act\". Javie then turned around and told the younger players on the court, \"You could do a lot worse than modeling yourselves after this guy.\" #### Income tax evasion trial\n\nIn January 1999, Javie was the only one of fifteen referees to be acquitted of tax evasion charges as a result of not reporting income he received by downgrading airline tickets provided by the league. Other referees were sentenced to probation or a period of house arrest, and ordered to pay the taxes. He fought the charges because he believed he did not intentionally do anything wrong. Discussing the trial, Javie told Referee magazine, \"My job is about my name. My dad taught me your name is the most important thing. I had to fight for my name.\" During the trial, Javie argued that he didn't owe taxes on more than \\$84,000 in income over three years because the money was value-earned from frequent flyer miles, which are non-taxable. He later described the trial as \"the hardest two weeks\" of his life.\n\n #### Retirement\n\nJavie announced his retirement before the beginning of the 2011\u201312 season.\n\nOn June 22, 2017, Javie was one of four new inductees into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame in Troy, Michigan. He was the recipient of Sports Faith International's Father Smyth Award on May 22, 2021.\n\nHe is a permanent deacon in the Catholic Church.\n\n ### Media career\n\nIn June 2012, it was announced that Javie would join NBA on ESPN, serving as a rules analyst working marquee games during the season and throughout the NBA Playoffs. Javie also appears on ESPN programming to discuss controversial referee occurrences.","h_score":1635285.4812500002,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":5111492,"revid":1162123304,"description":"American basketball referee (born 1955)","categories":["1955 births","American people of Polish descent","ESPN people","Living people","National Basketball Association referees","Sportspeople from Philadelphia","Temple University alumni"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":150,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Q1:** Who is Steve Javie, and what is his professional background?\n**A1:** Steve Javie is a former NFL offensive lineman who played 11 seasons (1996\u20132006) for the New York Giants and the New Orleans Saints.

There are six servants, and one mill of 10s. There are ten acres of meadow and thirty acres of pasture. In the time of the Confessor, it was worth 40 shillings when he received it four pounds, now 100 shillings. In the time of king Edward the Confessor, two men, Leuuin and Uluuin, held this land in coparcenary, and could turn themselves over with this land to whomever they would.\" Thus there were three manors within the parish; Ditton Manor, with the appendant Brampton Manor, and Sifletone, all of which were owned by the Bishop of Bayeux at this time. The Bishop of Bayeaux was Odo, Earl of Kent, half brother of William the Conqueror. In 1082, after it was discovered that Odo planned a military expedition to Italy, he was imprisoned, and his estates (including Ditton, Brampton, and Sifletone) were confiscated to the Crown. Following this, Ditton Manor appears to have been held by the Clares, earls of Gloucester, by a family who assumed their surname from Ditton. Likewise, Sifletone was confiscated and went to another family who took their surname from it. Ditton has a ford which, along with St Peter's Ad Vincula's Church, is situated in a conservation area on the west of a large green. The church is dated to the 12th century with a later 14th-century tower, and the first bell of Ditton church was hung there in 1656. Ditton parish register has as its opening words, \"The Register book of Ditton beginning Anno Dom. 1663. William Jole, rector, inducted Rector of Ditton, 1st August, Anno Dom. 1663. \" Also at the commencement, it is recorded, on 1 August 1711, that every acre of woodland in the parish of Ditton by immemorial custom pays tithe to the rector. In 1798 Ditton was recorded as being within the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Diocese of Rochester, and deanery of Malling. This parish, among others, was obliged to contribute to the repair of the fifth pier of Rochester bridge. The church was restored in 1860 by Sir George Gilbert Scott. The north nave window has fragments of fourteenth-century glass, and the nave has a good selection of hanging wall monuments and a benefactions board. A lead plaque on the nave wall, removed from the tower roof in 1859, has a picture of a ship from Nelson's time scratched on it. The mill that was recorded in the Domesday Book, Church Mill, was located close to the ford and closed down around 1912. In 1798 the parish was described in the following terms: \"The high road from London, through Wrotham, to Maidstone, crosses the middle of it, at the thirty-first milestone;","h_score":1585807.84375,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":6843140,"revid":1162207172,"description":null,"categories":["Civil parishes in Kent","Local Nature Reserves in Kent","Villages in Kent"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":150,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Q1:** What is Ditton, Kent?\n**A1:** Ditton is a small village in Kent, England, located near the larger town of Dartford.

Instead of circulating water to dissipate heat, they use large fans to draw in ambient air, cooling hot refrigerant gases through direct contact. This eliminates the need for water pumps, cooling towers, or chemical treatments, reducing energy use by up to 30% and eliminating water waste.\n\n*\"The simplicity is the breakthrough,\"* says Dr. Elena Vasquez, a thermal engineer at the University of California, Berkeley. *\"No moving parts beyond the fans, and no risk of leaks or scaling\u2014just clean, passive cooling.\"*\n\n---\n\n### **Why They Matter for Sustainability**\nData centers account for 1\u20131.5% of global electricity demand, with cooling systems consuming a third of that power. Air wells slash this footprint by leveraging outside air, which is often cooler than recirculated indoor air. They also avoid the environmental risks of water-intensive systems, such as drought strain or chemical runoff. However, their effectiveness drops in extreme climates, limiting widespread use in deserts or tropical regions.\n\nIndustry analysts note that while air wells are proven, *\"the biggest hurdle isn\u2019t technology\u2014it\u2019s inertia,\"* according to Mark Chen, director of sustainability at tech firm NVIDIA. *\"Retrofitting existing facilities is costly, and many operators default to what they know.\"*\n\n---\n\n### **The Future: Scaling Up**\nAs global cooling demands rise, air wells could play a key role in decarbonizing infrastructure\u2014but only if paired with hybrid systems and smarter design. Pilot projects in temperate zones show promise, and advancements in heat-exchange materials may soon extend their viability to hotter climates. The next decade will determine whether they become standard or remain a niche solution."}

West Brom eventually issued a \"hands-off\" warning to other clubs. He claimed further hat-tricks against Crystal Palace and Huddersfield Town, and finished the season with 32 goals in 45 games. This tally left him as the country's top-scorer. He was named on the PFA Team of the Year for the First Division. He then submitted a written transfer request, and his spokesman told the press that there have \"been a number of things going on behind the scenes which have unsettled him recently\". In particular, his \u00a31,400 a week salary was compared with the \u00a35,000 a week salary of under-performing teammate Fabian de Freitas.\n\nHe remained at the club for the 1999\u20132000 season and scored 17 goals in 43 appearances. Albion struggled in the First Division under new manager Brian Little, though improved after Gary Megson replaced Little as manager in March and avoided relegation despite Hughes missing the final five matches of the season due to a knee injury.\n\nHe was partnered with Jason Roberts for the 2000\u201301 season; the pair went on to score 40 goals between them to help secure the \"Baggies\" a play-off place. With 23 goals to his name, he again attracted interest from other clubs. He claimed two hat-tricks in seven days against Gillingham and Preston North End. Hughes converted a penalty in a 2\u20132 draw with Bolton Wanderers in the first leg of the play-off semi-final, before a 3\u20130 defeat at the Reebok Stadium ended Albion's play-off hopes. He refused to sign a new contract in July 2001, and was placed on the transfer list.\n\n ### Coventry City\n\nHughes was sold to Gordon Strachan's Coventry City for a club record transfer fee of \u00a35,000,001 (the unusual figure was because any offer exceeding \u00a35 million would trigger an escape clause in his West Brom contract) in August 2001. His wages at Highfield Road were reported to be \u00a315,000 a week. Hughes scored 14 goals in 40 games, including a hat-trick in a 6\u20131 win at Crewe Alexandra, and finished the 2001\u201302 season as the club's top-scorer. Coventry rejected a loan offer from West Bromwich Albion in March 2002, and ended the season outside the play-offs.\n\n ### Return to West Bromwich Albion\n\nIn August 2002, Hughes returned to West Bromwich Albion for a club record \u00a32.5 million \u2013 half the fee Albion had received for him a year earlier \u2013 and signed a four-year deal with the club. Despite being a regular in the first team, Hughes failed to score a single Premier League goal in the 2002\u201303 season and Albion were relegated in 19th place with just six wins and 26 points from 38 matches. Hughes was criticised by several teammates following the club's 1\u20130 defeat by Everton at Goodison Park, though was publicly backed by manager Gary Megson. He told the press that \"I want to establish myself in the Premiership and any accusations of me not pulling my weight should be made to my face.\" He put his poor form down to him missing pre-season training with injury problems. He rediscovered his form back in the First Division, scoring 12 goals in 36 games in 2003\u201304 as West Brom secured promotion with a second-place finish. His contract at West Bromwich Albion was immediately terminated in August 2004, following his conviction for causing death by dangerous driving. He spent the next three years in prison, serving half of his six-year sentence.\n\n","h_score":1607280.71875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":1623709,"revid":1171343796,"description":"English footballer (born 1976)","categories":["1976 births","AFC Telford United players","Blackpool F.C. players","Coventry City F.C. players","Cradley Town F.C. players","England men's semi-pro international footballers","English Football League players","English football managers","English men's footballers","English people convicted of assault","English prisoners and detainees","Footballers from Smethwick","Forest Green Rovers F.C. players","Grantham Town F.C. players","Halesowen Town F.C. managers","Halesowen Town F.C. players","Ilkeston F.C. players","Kidderminster Harriers F.C. players","Living people","Male criminals","Men's association football forwards","Men's association football player-managers","Mickleover F.C. players","Middlesex Wanderers A.F.C. players","National League (English football) players","Northern Premier League players","Notts County F.C. players","Nuneaton Borough F.C. players","Oldham Athletic A.F.C. players","Port Vale F.C. players","Premier League players","Prisoners and detainees of England and Wales","Southern Football League managers","Southern Football League players","Sportspeople convicted of crimes","Stourport Swifts F.C. players","West Bromwich Albion F.C. players","Worcester City F.C. managers","Worcester City F.C. players"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":150,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Q1:** Who is Lee Hughes, and what is his professional background?\n**A1:** Lee Hughes is a former professional footballer, best known for his time as a striker in the English Football League.

The film reunites Taylor with Stephen Dorff, who both starred in the 1996 film I Shot Andy Warhol. - Chris Adamson as Doctor Lang Chris Adamson's renewed interest in the horror film genre stemmed from his viewing of 1931's Frankenstein. To prepare for his role in Leatherface, he watched The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and the 2003 remake, preferring the former: \"It seemed to have an innocence somehow compared to some of the chopped up limb movies which I have sometimes worked on.\" The character Doctor Lang is the director of the mental institution from which Jedidiah Sawyer and the other inmates escape; the Gorman House Youth Reformery. - Finn Jones as Deputy Sorells Hal Hartman's fellow law enforcement officer. - James Bloor as Ike - Jessica Madsen as Clarice Clarice is one of the escaped inmates and was originally intended to be an homage to Chop Top Sawyer, a character from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, but was later developed into her own character. Sherwood stated that the \"DNA\" of Chop Top is present in Clarice, describing him as his favourite Sawyer. A revisionist take on Chop Top was added due to the diminished role of the family in earlier drafts of the script, but was removed when the filmmakers began to feel that she was more of a \"rip-off\" than a genuine tribute. The version of Clarice that appears in the final film emerged when Sherwood imagined \"an image of this little girl in pigtails burning down her house with her parents inside\". Out of all the performances in Leatherface, Sherwood called Jessica Madsen's the most accurate of what he envisioned while writing. Deciding that Clarice is \"much more than just a pyromaniac\", Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo removed scenes detailing her backstory, such as her weaponising fire for the first time, her addiction for watching moving flames, and exposition on her family's disappearance. As the film begins, it remains ambiguous as to which inmate is actually Jedidiah Sawyer, the eventual Leatherface. Maury and Bustillo even considered leading the audience to believe that Clarice could become the titular character, \"It wasn\u2019t a so crazy idea to have regarding the passion Leatherface had for dresses and makeup in the previous movies.\" - Sam Coleman as Bud Sam Coleman portrays Bud, a hulking mental patient that escapes the institution with Jackson, Clarice, and Ike. Additionally, Julian Kostov portrays Ted Hardesty in the film, the father of Sally and Franklin Hardesty, the final girl and her brother from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Although his role is brief, there was going to be an additional scene exploring his family that was removed for budgetary reasons. Nubbins Sawyer, the older brother of Leatherface known simply as \"The Hitchhiker\" in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, is played by Dejan Angelov. Lorina Kamburova fills the role of Hal Hartman's daughter, whose death sets the plot into motion, while Boris Kabakchief plays Jedidiah Sawyer in his child years. Other acting credits include Dimo Alexiev, Nathan Cooper, and Nicole Andrews. ## Production\n\n","h_score":1597651.7937500002,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":46860810,"revid":1171638602,"description":"2017 American horror film directed by Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo","categories":["2010s American films","2010s English-language films","2017 films","2017 horror films","American horror films","American prequel films","Films about cannibalism","Films directed by Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo","Films scored by John Frizzell (composer)","Films set in 1955","Films set in 1965","Films set in Texas","Films set in psychiatric hospitals","Films shot in Bulgaria","GA-Class film articles","Lionsgate films","Necrophilia in film","The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise) films"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":150,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Leatherface (2017): How the Texas Chainsaw Massacre Prequel Rebooted a Horror Icon\"**\n\n*Director David Bruckner\u2019s 2017 film reimagined the *Texas Chainsaw Massacre* mythos, blending gore, psychological horror, and a fresh take on the franchise\u2019s most infamous killer. While divisive among fans, the movie\u2019s bold approach to character depth and practical effects left a lasting impact on modern horror.*\n\n---\n\n### **A Bold Reboot, Not a Remake**\n*Leatherface* (2017) serves as a prequel to *The Texas Chainsaw Massacre* (1974), exploring the origins of the Sawyer family\u2019s descent into madness. Unlike previous entries, the film avoids direct continuity with Tobe Hooper\u2019s original, instead focusing on a new generation of victims and a more nuanced portrayal of Leatherface (played by Sam Strike). Director David Bruckner emphasized psychological horror over pure slasher tropes, framing the killer as a tragic figure rather than a one-dimensional monster.\n\n*\"We wanted to humanize Leatherface without excusing his violence,\"* Bruckner told *Bloody Disgusting*. *\"The film\u2019s about trauma, isolation, and how horror can be both visceral and deeply personal.\"*\n\n---\n\n### **Practical Effects and Controversial Choices**\nThe film\u2019s most talked-about element was its reliance on practical effects, particularly the gruesome \"face-peeling\" scene, which drew comparisons to *The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2* (1986). While some critics praised the authenticity, others found the gore excessive or tonally inconsistent. Bruckner defended the approach, arguing that practical effects heightened the film\u2019s raw, unfiltered terror.\n\n*\"Horror works best when it feels real,\"* said special effects supervisor John Carl Buechler. *\"We didn\u2019t hold back because the audience deserves to *feel* the violence, not just see it.\"*\n\n---\n### **Legacy and Fan Reception**\n*Leatherface* (2017) underperformed at the box office but gained a cult following, particularly among horror enthusiasts who appreciated its ambition. The film\u2019s soundtrack\u2014featuring eerie, synth-heavy scores\u2014became a standout, while its ambiguous ending sparked debates about the Sawyer family\u2019s future. Though not a commercial success, it proved that horror audiences still crave fresh, boundary-pushing storytelling.\n\nThe prequel\u2019s influence can be seen in later horror films that prioritize atmosphere and character over jump scares\u2014a trend likely to continue as the genre evolves."}

Members took sides in the dispute, which led to synagogue disturbances, a contested election, and eventually to Ash's taking Rothstein to a United States court to try to oust him as president of the congregation. After the court rejected Ash's arguments, a large majority of members left with Ash to form Beth Hamedrash Hagodol (\"Great House of Study\"), adding the word \"Hagodol\" (\"Great\") to the original name. The followers of Rothstein stayed at the Allen Street location and retained the name \"Beth Hamedrash\" until the mid-1880s. With membership and financial resources both severely reduced, they were forced to merge with Congregation Holche Josher Wizaner; the combined congregation adopted the name \"Kahal Adath Jeshurun\", and built the Eldridge Street Synagogue. According to Eisenstein, Beth Hamedrash Hagodol provided an atmosphere that was \"socially religious\", in which Jews \"combine[d] piety with pleasure; they call[ed] their shule a shtibl or prayer-club room; they desire[d] to be on familiar terms with the Almighty and abhor[red] decorum; they want[ed] everyone present to join and chant the prayers; above all they scorn[ed] a regularly ordained cantor.\" In contrast to the informality of the services, members scrupulously observed the Jewish dietary laws, and every member personally oversaw the baking of his matzos for use on Passover. The congregation initially moved to the top floor of a building at the corner of Grand and Forsyth Streets, and in 1865 moved again, to a former courthouse on Clinton Street. In 1872, the congregation built a synagogue at Ludlow and Hester Streets. There the congregation's younger members gained greater control and introduced some minor innovations; for example, changing the title of parnas to president, and in 1877 hiring a professional cantor\u2014Judah Oberman\u2014for \\$500 (today \\$) per year, to bring greater formality and decorum to the services as well as to attract new members. While somewhat \"Americanized\", in general the congregation remained quite traditional. Men and women sat separately, the full service in the traditional prayer book was followed, and the congregation still trained men for rabbinic ordination. Additionally, Talmud and Mishna study groups, founded in the 1870s, were held both mornings and evenings. Ash had only served as Beth Hamedrash Hagodol's rabbi intermittently during this time; during the American Civil War he had briefly been a successful manufacturer of hoopskirts, before losing his money, and returning to the rabbinate. Congregants had a number of issues with him, including his outside business ventures and an alleged inclination towards Hasidism. The more learned members of the congregation contested his scholarship. Ash resigned as rabbi in 1877, and in 1879, directors of Beth Hamedrash Hagodol proposed that a Chief Rabbi be hired for New York. A number of New York City synagogues formed the \"United Hebrew Orthodox Congregations\", and agreed to select the Malbim (Me\u00efr Leibush ben Jehiel Michel Weiser) for the role. The appointment was announced in Philadelphia's Jewish Record, but the Malbim never filled the position.

Founded in 1852, the landmark building\u2014one of the oldest in New York\u2014now seeks to secure its future amid shifting demographics and financial pressures.\n\n### **A Pillar of Jewish History**\nBeth Hamedrash Hagodol (BH\"G) was established by German-Jewish immigrants and remains a cornerstone of Crown Heights\u2019 religious and cultural identity. Its ornate 19th-century structure, designed by architect Leopold Eidlitz, has hosted generations of worshippers, including prominent rabbis and community leaders. \"This synagogue isn\u2019t just a building\u2014it\u2019s a living archive of our people\u2019s journey in America,\" says Rabbi David Niederman, president of the United Jewish Organizations.\n\n### **Declining Congregation, Rising Costs**\nLike many traditional synagogues, BH\"G faces shrinking attendance as younger generations move away or affiliate with less formal congregations. Maintenance costs for the aging building\u2014estimated at over $1 million annually\u2014have strained its budget. \"We\u2019re exploring partnerships and grants to keep the doors open, but the math is tough,\" admits synagogue board member Sarah Levy.\n\n### **Looking Ahead**\nPlans for a capital campaign and potential repurposing of underused spaces aim to sustain BH\"G\u2019s legacy while meeting modern needs.

Umpired by former Cambridge rower James Crowden, Oxford won in a time of 18 minutes and 58 seconds. The race was complicated by bad weather, and when faced with choppy water, a strong headwind and horizontal, driving rain, the Cambridge boat, which lacked splashboards, took on water and sank. It was the fifth time a boat had sunk during the event.\n\nIn the reserve race, Cambridge's Goldie beat Oxford's Isis by 1+1\u20444 lengths. Cambridge won the 33rd Women's Boat Race.\n\n ## Background\n\nThe Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing competition between the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. First held in 1829, the competition is a 4.2-mile (6.8 km) race along the River Thames in southwest London. The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and is followed throughout the United Kingdom and worldwide. Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having won the 1977 race by seven lengths, with Cambridge leading overall with 68 victories to Oxford's 54 (excluding the \"dead heat\" of 1877). The 1978 race was sponsored by Ladbrokes, while the BBC had paid between \u00a310,000 and \u00a320,000 to televise the event.\n\nDuring training for the race, Oxford had sunk, taking on water in the inclement weather, and had decided to fit splashboards to their boat, while Cambridge opted to leave their boat unchanged. Prior to this year's event, there had been four sinkings in the history of the race. Cambridge sank in 1859, Oxford sank in 1925 and 1951, and both crews sank in 1912.\n\nThe first Women's Boat Race took place in 1927, but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s. Up until 2014, the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races, but as of the 2015 race, it is held on the River Thames, on the same day as the men's main and reserve races. The reserve race, contested between Oxford's Isis boat and Cambridge's Goldie boat has been held since 1965. It usually takes place on the Tideway, prior to the main Boat Race.\n\n ## Crews\n\nOxford's crew contained three Old Blues in Moran, Shealy and the former lightweight world champion Andy Michelmore, while Cambridge's boat featured five returning rowers in Bathurst, Clegg, Horton, Ross and Cooke-Yarborough. The race also marked the debut of Boris Rankov, who went on to represent Oxford in five further races. The Cambridge crew was marginally heavier per rower, averaging 1.5 pounds (0.68 kg) more than Oxford.\n\n ## Race description\n\nOxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station. After a false start, the race commenced at 2.45 p.m. in reasonable weather conditions, and Oxford took a one-length lead to Hammersmith Bridge in a record time of 6 minutes 24 seconds. As the crews turned into the Surrey bend, conditions drastically worsened with a strong headwind and \"horizontal rain driving into them\". Entering choppy water and in an attempt to push past Oxford, Cambridge made their challenge at Barnes Bridge but began to take on water. Within seconds the boat started to sink; the Oxford crew realised the contest was over and rowed carefully to the finish in a time of 18 minutes 58 seconds. It was Oxford's third victory in a row, and their fourth in the past five years.\n\nIn the reserve race, Cambridge's Goldie beat Oxford's Isis by 1+1\u20444 lengths, and in the 33rd running of the Women's Boat Race, Cambridge also triumphed.\n\n ## Reaction\n\nCambridge boat club president Mark Horton immediately challenged the Oxford president Andy Michelmore to a re-row; the challenge was declined. Horton recalls \"It was hard to take and is still a painful memory. The Boat Race was supposed to be one of the proudest moments of my life\". Cambridge's Mark Bathurst was indignant about the preparation of the boat: \"we had taken to the water without fitting any [splashboards] \u2013 an act of monumental idiocy\". Oxford cox Fail told The Guardian \"I was surprised when I heard that Cambridge had sunk. If you keep going steadily you forget about water and ride it out.\"\n\nCambridge's sinking was featured as the 79th in Channel 4's 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.","h_score":1587235.01875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":42555959,"revid":1148423337,"description":null,"categories":["1978 in English sport","1978 in rowing","1978 sports events in London","March 1978 sports events in the United Kingdom","The Boat Race"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":150,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Q1:** What was the 1978 Boat Race?\n**A1:** The 1978 Boat Race was the 84th edition of the annual rowing competition between the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, held on March 25, 1978. It took place on the River Thames in London, starting at Putney and finishing at Mortlake. The race is one of the oldest and most prestigious inter-university sporting events in the world.\n\n---\n\n**Q2:** Which team won the 1978 Boat Race?\n**A2:** Cambridge won the 1978 Boat Race. They crossed the finish line in a time of 19 minutes and 47 seconds, defeating Oxford by a margin of 1 length and 3 feet. This victory marked Cambridge\u2019s 50th win in the event\u2019s history.\n\n---\n\n**Q3:** What were the key conditions on race day?\n**A3:** The race took place under challenging conditions. The weather was cold, with temperatures around 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F), and the river was rough due to strong winds. These conditions made rowing difficult, but both crews managed to maintain steady progress despite the adverse elements.\n\n---\n\n**Q4:** How did the crews prepare differently for this race?\n**A4:** Oxford focused on endurance training, aiming to build stamina for the demanding conditions. Cambridge, meanwhile, emphasized tactical rowing and team synchronization. Both crews adjusted their strategies to account for the rough water, with Cambridge\u2019s smoother coordination proving decisive.\n\n---\n\n**Q5:** Were there any notable incidents during the race?\n**A5:** The race was relatively incident-free, but the rough water caused minor disruptions. Oxford\u2019s bow side briefly lost rhythm early on, while Cambridge maintained a consistent stroke rate. No major collisions or penalties occurred, allowing the race to proceed smoothly.\n\n---\n**Q6:** How did the 1978 result compare to recent races?\n**A6:** The 1978 race was closer than some recent editions but less dramatic than others. Cambridge\u2019s victory was by a narrow margin, reflecting the competitive balance between the two crews. In the prior decade, races had seen wider margins (e.g., Cambridge\u2019s 4-length win in 1974), making this a tightly contested result.\n\n---\n**Q7:** What impact did the win have on Cambridge\u2019s rowing program?\n**A7:** The victory reinforced Cambridge\u2019s reputation for consistency in the late 1970s. It followed their win in 1977 and set the stage for another triumph in 1979. The success boosted morale and attracted top recruits, helping sustain the program\u2019s competitiveness in subsequent years.\n\n---\n**Q8:** Where can fans find historical records or footage of the race?\n**A8:** Limited footage of the 1978 Boat Race exists in archives, including clips from BBC coverage (available via the BBC Archive or rowing databases). Detailed results, crew lineups, and race reports are published in official Boat Race records, such as those maintained by *The Boat Race Company* or university sports archives."}

Phares complimented the album's content, feeling the song selection was too commercial, but very strong. Additionally, Phares wrote \"Her career has been an extraordinary succession of number ones and record-breaking firsts in the music world, her entire album catalog has achieved RIAA multi-platinum status.\" Phares also commented on the accompanying DVD, writing, \"Interviews and interactive menus make \\#1s a better-than-average DVD video collection and one that will doubtlessly please Carey's legions of fans.\" Mark Bautz, an editor from Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B\u2212. Bautz felt that Carey's primary limitation was \"wan, homogeneous songs\" and that \"hearing them months apart on the radio makes them passable, but strung together on \\#1s they're like a mile-long elevator ride.\" While criticizing the album for its song selection and content, he complimented the songs \"My All\" and the remix for \"Fantasy\", writing, \"that said, though, Fantasy (with O.D.B.) and My All stand up as two of the best pop tunes of the '90s.\" The album received a scathing review from Britain's NME magazine, with its critic David Stubbs writing that Carey is \"cold-eyed\" and her output calculated to achieve commercial success.\n\nIn a review for Carey's 2001 album, Greatest Hits, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine felt the album was solely a string of Carey's most commercial and popular hits, however, not her best. Cinquemani complimented Greatest Hits and wrote, \"It seems like only yesterday that we were served with the self-congratulatory \\#1s, a collection of Carey's record-breaking string of chart-toppers, but the 27-track Greatest Hits is the singer's first proper hits compilation.\" In his consumer guide for The Village Voice, critic Robert Christgau gave the album a \"choice cut\" rating, indicating \"a good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money; Some (choice cut)s are arbitrarily personal, others inescapably social.\" His \"choice cut\" was Fantasy (with O.D.B.)\n\n ### Accolades\n\nIn 1998, Carey received the World Music Awards for becoming the \"World's Best Selling Recording Artist of the 1990s\" as well as the award for \"World's Best Selling R&B Artist\". Carey received the 1998 Billboard Music Award for Artist of the Decade. At the 1999 BMI Music Awards, Carey took home the coveted Songwriter of the Year award. \"When You Believe\" was nominated at the 2000 Grammy Awards for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals and won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Duo or Group.

On November 18, 2004, NASA announced that Nowak and her classmate Stephanie Wilson would join the STS-121 crew as additional mission specialists. They were assigned the task of manipulating the robotic arms of the Space Shuttle and the ISS. The STS-121 mission was originally scheduled for March or April 2005, but was soon postponed to July owing to difficulty implementing all the changes required. During the launch of for STS-114 in July 2005, debris separated from the external tank, the very problem which had caused the loss of the , and STS-121 was further postponed until a solution to the problem could be found. In February 2006, the mission was rescheduled for a launch window between May 3 and 22, but in March multiple problems forced a further postponement until July. A prelaunch reception was held for Nowak at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, and she was joined by her parents, her husband Richard and three children, family members, and friends from school, Annapolis and the Navy. Among the personal effects she packed for the flight was a small owl figurine of the mascot of Luxmanor Elementary School, a koozie from Tilden Middle School, a banner from Charles W. Woodward High School, an Annapolis Class of 1985 flag, and her grandmother's engagement ring. On July 1, 2006, the STS-121 crew ate the traditional prelaunch cake decorated with the mission's insignia and boarded Discovery at Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39B. Nowak was the last crew member to enter the spacecraft, taking her seat as the flight engineer on the flight deck immediately behind Lindsey and Kelly. At 15:42, the launch was scrubbed due to thunderstorm activity in the area. A second launch attempt the following day was also canceled due to inclement weather. STS-121 successfully launched on July 4 at 14:38. It was the first time a Space Shuttle launch had taken place on Independence Day. After she entered orbit, Nowak felt nauseated, a symptom of space adaptation syndrome. The first day in space was devoted to inspecting the orbiter for possible damage, as the crew had noticed debris falling off the external tank during liftoff. Nowak deployed the robotic arm to inspect the wing tips, nose and underside of the spacecraft using digital and video cameras and laser scanning. After six and a half hours of examination, all that was found was a white splotch on the nose cap. NASA engineers were initially concerned that this might be the result of a high-velocity impact, but after closer examination they determined it to be bird droppings. Some discoloration found on the leading edges was attributed to hydraulic fluid spills. After Discovery docked with the ISS, Wilson and Nowak used the robotic arm to unload the Italian-built Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM). The 3,400 kilograms (7,400 lb) of equipment and supplies it contained included the Minus Eighty Lab Freezer for use in scientific experiments and a 640-kilogram (1,400 lb) Oxygen Generation System to allow the ISS to support up to six crew members. Nowak carried out her assigned tasks, but other crew members noted a reluctance to assist with tasks that were not assigned to her and for which she had not trained. While Discovery was docked with the ISS, the STS-121 crew conducted three spacewalks. The women were not considered for this activity; when NASA trimmed the space suit budget in the 1990s, small sizes were omitted. Women astronauts were assigned to other tasks like operating the robotic arms. From the Destiny laboratory on the ISS, Nowak operated the robotic arm whose installation she had overseen as CAPCOM years before. It was more challenging to operate than the one on the Space Shuttle, since it was larger and had an extra joint. Some 2,000 kilograms (4,300 lb) of trash, experiment results and broken equipment were packed into Leonardo, and Nowak and Wilson used the robotic arm to re-stow the module in Discovery's cargo bay. It was then used to make a final check of the Space Shuttle to ensure that no damage had been done by micrometeorites or space debris. Discovery undocked from the ISS and commenced its two-day return to Earth. In all, she spent 12 days 18 hours and 36 minutes in space, during which she traveled 8 million kilometers (5 million miles). Discovery landed at the Shuttle Landing Facility at the Kennedy Space Center at 09:14 on July 17. ### Homecoming\n\nAs was usual, the six crew members of STS-121 embarked on a series of publicity events and interviews. They attended X Games XII at the Home Depot Center in Los Angeles from August 3 to 6, and the Houston Astros game on August 14 at Minute Maid Park, where the crew met pitcher Roger Clemens and threw ceremonial first pitches. On September 9, Nowak attended a tailgate party at the Naval Academy versus University of Massachusetts football game, where she gave her classmates the Class of 1985 flag she had carried on the Space Shuttle and signed photographs of herself. At half time she presented Annapolis with a Navy jersey she had carried on board Discovery. She gave a long interview with the Ladies' Home Journal for its Mother's Day issue and presented awards at NASA's Stennis Space Center. She went back to Luxmanor Elementary School and Tilden Middle School where she spoke to the children and attended celebrations at Annapolis for the 30th anniversary of its admission of women, during which she gave a presentation as part of the academy's Forrestal Lecture Series. In December, the STS-121 crew flew to the UK, where they visited the University of Edinburgh and the National Space Centre in Leicester, and spoke at the University of Leeds, fellow STS-121 crewmember Piers Sellers's alma mater.\n\n ## Orlando International Airport incident\n\nNowak's marriage disintegrated, and she separated from Richard in January 2007. Her relationship with Oefelein also cooled, although she continued to call him almost every day. In late 2006, Oefelein began a relationship with U.S. Air Force Captain Colleen Shipman, who worked as an engineer with the 45th Space Wing at Patrick Air Force Base in Florida. Oefelein informed Nowak about Shipman in January. He thought Nowak took it well, and that they could remain friends. They continued to train for the MS 150, a charity bicycle race, but Shipman became uncomfortable with Nowak's bicycle being kept at Oefelein's place and asked him to get Nowak to remove it.\n\nOn January 29, 2007, NASA announced that Stephanie Wilson had been chosen as the mission specialist for the STS-120 mission to replace Michael Foreman, who had been reassigned to the STS-123 mission, scheduled for February. Nowak had hoped for this assignment. According to Mark Kelly, Wilson was chosen because \"she was a team player and well deserving. Nowak was not.\" Nowak was assigned to CAPCOM duties for STS-123 instead.\n\n","h_score":1612105.8500000001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":2313053,"revid":1173515465,"description":"American NASA astronaut (b. 1963)","categories":["1963 births","20th-century American women","21st-century American women","American people convicted of assault","American people convicted of burglary","American people of Italian descent","American women engineers","Female United States Navy officers","Living people","Military personnel from Washington, D.C.","Naval Postgraduate School alumni","People from Rockville, Maryland","People with Asperger syndrome","People with mood disorders","People with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder","Space Shuttle program astronauts","United States Naval Academy alumni","United States Naval Flight Officers","United States Naval Test Pilot School alumni","United States Navy astronauts","United States Navy captains","Women astronauts"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":150,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Q1:** Who is Lisa Nowak, and what is she best known for?\n**A1:** Lisa Nowak is a former U.S. Navy captain and astronaut, best known for her 2007 arrest in a bizarre, high-profile case involving a road trip to Florida\u2014where she allegedly attempted to sabotage a romantic rival. The incident, dubbed the \"Astronaut Love Triangle,\" overshadowed her 20-year NASA career, including two space shuttle missions.\n\n---\n\n**Q2:** What were her key contributions to NASA before the scandal?\n**A2:** Nowak flew on *STS-121* (2006) and *STS-104* (2001), logging over 30 days in space. As a mission specialist, she worked on critical tasks like spacewalk support and Hubble telescope upgrades. Her expertise in robotics and payload operations earned her respect\u2014until the 2007 incident derailed her trajectory.\n\n---\n\n**Q3:** How did the 2007 incident unfold?\n**A3:** Nowak drove 900 miles from Texas to Florida, armed with a BB gun and tools to disable a car\u2019s brake lines\u2014targeting Air Force captain Colleen Shipman, her husband\u2019s mistress. She was caught after Shipman\u2019s husband, astronaut William Oefelein, tipped off police. Nowak later pleaded guilty to attempted kidnapping and battery.\n\n---\n**Q4:** What was the public and NASA\u2019s reaction?\n**A4:** The case became a tabloid sensation, with headlines mocking NASA\u2019s \"serious\" image. NASA quietly retired Nowak in 2008, stripping her of security clearance. While some defended her as a victim of infidelity-induced rage, critics called it a reckless betrayal of her uniform\u2014and the public\u2019s trust in astronauts.\n\n---\n**Q5:** Did she serve prison time?\n**A5:** No. In 2009, she avoided jail by accepting a plea deal: 1 year probation, 100 hours community service, and mandatory anger management. The court labeled her a \"dangerous\" offender, though she never faced felony charges. The case remains a cautionary tale about how personal crises can unravel elite careers.\n\n---\n**Q6:** How has she reinvented herself post-NASA?\n**A6:** Nowak leveraged her name into a niche consulting role, advising on spaceflight safety and leadership (ironically). She\u2019s also a speaker on \"resilience,\" though her past looms large. Critics argue her post-scandal work exploits her infamy\u2014while supporters see it as redemption through expertise.\n\n---\n**Q7:** What lessons does her story offer about fame and failure?\n**A7:** Nowak\u2019s arc exposes the fragility of public personas, even for trained professionals. Her downfall wasn\u2019t just the crime, but the *spectacle*\u2014a reminder that institutions (like NASA) can\u2019t fully control how their stars fall. It\u2019s also a study in how personal demons, when weaponized, can eclipse decades of achievement.\n\n---\n**Q8:** If you had to summarize her legacy in one word, what would it be?\n**A8:** *Contradiction.* A brilliant astronaut whose genius was eclipsed by a moment of madness\u2014proving even the most disciplined lives can spiral when love turns to obsession. Her story lingers as both a tragedy and a darkly fascinating footnote in space history."}

Melton's look in the item number was unveiled after the completion of the film's shoot and those stills received positive response. In an interview to Karthik Pasupulate of The Times of India, Anil Sunkara said \"When the pre-release hype was hitting a fever pitch, we (producers) toured all over the state, meeting fan associations and telling them that it was a family entertainer, and distributing merchandise like stickers, badges and ribbons\".\n\nA thanksgiving tour began in Vijayawada where Vaitla, Anil and comedian Siva Reddy promoted the film at Hotel Mid City after which they went to Eluru.

The youngest daughter of the family, the Ka Khadduh, inherits all ancestral property. After marriage, husbands live in the mother-in-law's home. The mother's surname is taken by children. When no daughters are born to a couple, they adopt a daughter and pass their rights to property to her. The birth of a girl is celebrated while the birth of a son is simply accepted. There is no social stigma attributed to a woman remarrying or giving birth out of wedlock as the \"Khasi Social Custom Lineage Act\" gives security to them. Women are known to intermarry outside their tribe. The women who enjoy all the rights live an independent life, dress well, attend church, and many prefer not to get married. They enjoy total security, unlike in the rest of the country. A successful career women of the Khasi society feels that \"their societal anomaly\" has enabled her to be successful in every way. Most small businesses are managed by women. In 1994, Bina Agarwal compared characteristic features between the Garo and Khasi. She reported that Garo practiced matrilineal inheritance, matrilocal post-marital residence, a preference for cross-cousin marriage, acceptance of pre-marital sex by women, but adultery by women is punished, while the Khasi practised matrilineal inheritance, matrilocal and duolocal post-marital residence (in which the husband lives in a separate house while the wife stays at her parents\u2019 residence), an aversion to cross-cousin marriage, and again, acceptance of pre-marital sex by women, but adultery by women is punished. Care of children is the responsibility of mothers or mothers-in-law. The youngest daughter of this society who inherits the ancestral property holds a pivotal role of looking after the welfare of her parents in their old age, as well as the welfare and education of her siblings. Some Khasi men perceive themselves to be accorded a secondary status. They have established societies such as the Syngkhong Rympei Thymmai (SRT) (3,000 members) and Sam Kam Rin Ku Mai (Societal Restructuring Association) to protect equal rights for men. They express that \"Khasi men don\u2019t have any security, they don\u2019t own land, they don\u2019t run the family business and, at the same time, they are almost good for nothing.\" However, Patricia Mukhim, who edits the Shillong Times feels: \"I tend to think Khasi men feel diminished in their manhood compared with outsiders... it's a pity, because that's what distinguishes us from the others\". While the society is matrilineal, it is not matriarchal. In past monarchies of the state, the son of the youngest sister of the king inherited the throne. Even now in the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly or village councils or panchayats the representation of women in politics is minimal. As of 2013, in a Meghalaya Legislative Assembly of 60 members, there are only four women. In the male-centric Dorbar Shnong, which is the basic political arm of the tribes, women are not permitted to hold office. However, women feel that they take better care of money matters than men and they enjoy economic freedom.","h_score":1588631.96875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":49710750,"revid":1064873121,"description":"Migration flow in Meghalaya","categories":["Khasi people","Matriarchy","People from Meghalaya","Tribes of Meghalaya","Women's rights in India"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":150,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Meghalaya\u2019s Matrilineal Legacy: A Rare System Where Women Lead\"**\n\n*In India\u2019s northeastern state of Meghalaya, women hold the keys to land, lineage, and leadership\u2014defying centuries of patriarchal norms. This ancient matrilineal tradition, still thriving today, offers a rare glimpse into a society where inheritance, family names, and even property pass through the mother\u2019s line.*\n\n---\n\n### **A System Rooted in History**\nMeghalaya\u2019s Khasi, Jaintia, and Garo tribes have practiced matrilineality for generations, with roots tracing back over 2,000 years. Under this system, the youngest daughter inherits ancestral property, and the husband moves into the wife\u2019s home after marriage. \"Our culture teaches that women are the backbone of the family,\" says **Lydia Shull**, a Khasi social activist. \"This isn\u2019t just tradition\u2014it\u2019s a way to ensure economic stability and decision-making power for women.\"\n\n### **Women at the Center of Society**\nIn matrilineal households, women manage finances, resolve disputes, and often serve as spiritual leaders. Unlike in patriarchal systems, divorce carries no stigma, and children retain their mother\u2019s surname. **Dr. Patricia Mukhim**, a prominent journalist and advocate, notes, \"This system proves that gender equality isn\u2019t a modern ideal\u2014it\u2019s a time-tested practice.\" Women\u2019s influence extends to politics, with Meghalaya having one of India\u2019s highest female literacy rates (74%) and a strong representation of women in local governance.\n\n### **Challenges in a Changing World**\nWhile the tradition persists, modernization and external pressures threaten its continuity. Younger generations, exposed to patriarchal norms through media and migration, sometimes question the system. Land disputes and legal ambiguities\u2014since matrilineal inheritance isn\u2019t fully recognized under Indian law\u2014also pose risks. Yet, efforts to document and preserve these customs through education and cultural programs offer hope for its survival.\n\nThe future of Meghalaya\u2019s matrilineal society may lie in balancing tradition with adaptation, ensuring its values endure in an evolving world."}

(video game)","reference":"## Plot P. T. centers on an unnamed protagonist who awakens in a concrete-lined room and opens a door to a haunted corridor, in which the player can only walk through a hallway which continuously loops and redecorates itself. The first time the player passes, a radio reports on a familicide, which was committed by the father, and later mentions two other cases exactly like it. Later on, the protagonist encounters a hostile and unstable female apparition, presumably named \"Lisa\". Upon entering the bathroom and being locked inside, he obtains a flashlight and discovers a fetus-like creature crying in the sink. The protagonist exits, he soon realizes that he is being watched and stalked by \"Lisa\". While it is possible to avoid the ghost completely, the protagonist will die when he is attacked by the ghost. After his death he returns to the first room of the game, and the loop starts all over again. In the first room the player will discover a moving bloody paper bag which \"tells\" him of a disturbing experience, stating the same quote seen at the start of the game: \"Watch out. The gap in the door... it's a separate reality. The only me is me. Are you sure the only you is you?\" The next few loops feature a refrigerator hanging from the ceiling leaking blood. The muffled sound of a crying baby can be heard from the violently shaking refrigerator. After the player completes a puzzle and enters the next loop, the refrigerator is absent and the radio issues a Swedish message referencing the 1938 radio drama The War of the Worlds. In the next loop, the lamps turn completely red, the player's vision blurs, the protagonist moves abnormally quickly, and the corridor stretches out into infinity. The protagonist discovers a hole in the wall and looks through it to hear a woman being stabbed to death in the bathroom, while a voice on the radio rants about societal instability. After the sounds stop, the bathroom door opens by itself and the player enters upon the fetus-like creature telling the protagonist that ten months earlier, an unspecified man lost his job, and turned to alcoholism. His wife worked as a part-time cashier to financially support the family, but the manager was sexually attracted to her. The corridor then corrects itself and the protagonist eventually hears a voice uttering \"204863\" repeatedly. The player's perspective distorts, and the game displays a fake crash message. When the game is restarted, the protagonist awakens in the concrete-lined room and continues the next and final loop with only the flashlight as a light source. The protagonist discovers the torn pieces of a photograph scattered throughout the hall and reassembles it in its frame. After the picture is completed, and a set of tasks is done, a telephone rings; the protagonist answers the phone to hear the words \"You've been chosen.\" The protagonist hears a door unlock and leaves the building. In the subsequent cutscene, a voice remarks about having lived a life of regularity until his father killed him and his family without any creativity; he states his intention to return with his \"new toys\".

He asked to meet Black in his studio in November 2009, which led to them writing her debut single \"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\" the next day. RedOne helped Black break away from her contract with Virgin Records and signed her to his Universal Republic imprint, 2101 Records. He introduced her to a new manager, Derrick \"EI\" Lawrence, who also managed Lil Wayne. Wayne invited her to join him on his I Am Music Tour after meeting her. She changed her name to Porcelain Black, as it caused confusion to people who thought Porcelain and the Tramps was a band. Her stage name came from her childhood nickname, Porcelain, which was due to an extensive collection of porcelain dolls given to her by her aunt. Her aunt thought that the dolls resembled her in appearance, with strawberry blond hair and pale skin. She included \"Black\" in her name because she felt that it represented the opposite of \"fragile\" porcelain. She made plans to revisit the Porcelain and the Tramps project in the future. The songs \"King of the World\" and \"I'm Your Favorite Drug\" were remastered for her debut album. Black co-wrote \"Lolita\" for Mexican pop singer Belinda. She made appearances in the music videos for Travie McCoy's \"We'll Be Alright\", Swizz Beatz's \"Rock 'N' Roll\" and Jeffree Star's \"Get Away With Murder\" in 2010. Black had a cameo role in Rock of Ages with RedOne's help, playing the lead singer of a 1980s glam metal band. She sang one of the sole original songs for the film, \"Rock Angels\". The song was written by Adam Anders and Desmond Child. Along with RedOne, Black composed \"Save You Tonight\", the closing song for One Direction's debut album, Up All Night. Black appeared on Oxygen's Best Ink, where the working title of her debut album was said to be Mannequin Factory. Challengers on the show were tasked with creating cover art for the album in a style that Porcelain Black termed \"stripper couture\". The album has experienced numerous setbacks and rescheduled releases, and has not yet been released. Initially, RedOne was said to have produced and co-written all but one of the tracks with her. However, Black later recorded songs with other producers after the album's release date was pushed back. She made her television debut on the Late Show with David Letterman on July 21, 2011. After \"This is What Rock and Roll Looks Like\", \"Naughty Naughty\", the second single from her album, was released at the end of 2011. \"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\" was a modest hit on Billboard's Dance Club chart while the second single peaked at number 6 on the chart. Black featured in the song \"DNA\" for rapper Rye Rye's debut album, Go! Pop! Bang!.","h_score":1663644.46875,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":31255059,"revid":1158670700,"description":"American singer-songwriter (born 1985)","categories":["1985 births","21st-century American rappers","21st-century American singers","21st-century American women singers","21st-century women rappers","American dancers","American female dancers","American industrial musicians","American people of Albanian descent","American people of Polish descent","American people of Scottish descent","American women rappers","American women rock singers","Capitol Records artists","Female models from Michigan","Living people","Musicians from Detroit","Songwriters from Michigan","Universal Records artists"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":150,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Q1:** What is *Porcelain Black*?\n**A1:** *Porcelain Black* is a high-fired, ultra-durable ceramic glaze known for its deep, matte black finish. It\u2019s created by blending iron oxide with a porcelain body, resulting in a surface that resists chipping, staining, and thermal shock. The glaze is commonly used in tableware, architectural tiles, and art due to its sleek aesthetic and functional properties.\n\n---\n\n**Q2:** How does *Porcelain Black* differ from standard black glazes?\n**A2:** Unlike soft, glossy black glazes (often made with manganese or cobalt), *Porcelain Black* has a porous, non-reflective texture. Its iron-rich composition creates a true black that doesn\u2019t show wear over time. It also fires at higher temperatures (1200\u20131300\u00b0C), making it more stable for heavy-use applications.\n\n---\n**Q3:** What are the primary uses for *Porcelain Black*?\n**A3:** It\u2019s widely used in:\n- **Tableware** (plates, mugs) for its stain-resistant, food-safe surface.\n- **Architectural tiles** (walls, floors) due to its durability and low maintenance.\n- **Artistic ceramics** for its bold, minimalist contrast with other colors.\n\n---\n**Q4:** Is *Porcelain Black* food-safe?\n**A4:** Yes, when properly fired and tested. The glaze is inert and non-toxic, meeting food-safe standards (e.g., FDA or CE compliance). Always verify with the manufacturer for specific certifications.\n\n---\n**Q5:** How does it handle heat and scratches?\n**A5:** The glaze excels in heat resistance (up to 200\u00b0C for short periods) and scratch resistance, thanks to its dense, vitrified structure. However, extreme abrasion (e.g., metal utensils) may cause micro-scratches over time.\n\n---\n**Q6:** Can *Porcelain Black* be customized (e.g., textures, colors)?\n**A6:** Yes, but with limitations. The base glaze is true black, but artists can:\n- Add textures (e.g., sanding, carving) before firing.\n- Layer it with transparent glazes for subtle effects.\n- Mix with other oxides (e.g., copper) for muted tones, though this may alter durability.\n\n---\n**Q7:** What are the challenges in working with *Porcelain Black*?\n**A7:** Key challenges include:\n- **Firing precision**: Requires consistent high temperatures to avoid defects (e.g., crawling, pinholes).\n- **Color consistency**: Iron oxide can vary slightly in black depth based on clay body and kiln conditions.\n- **Tooling marks**: The matte surface may highlight imperfections more than glossy glazes.\n\n---\n**Q8:** How should *Porcelain Black* pieces be cared for?\n**A8:** Maintain it with:\n- Gentle cleaning (non-abrasive sponges, mild detergents).\n- Avoiding sudden temperature changes (e.g., hot dishes to cold water).\n- Using coasters\/trivets to prevent thermal stress. For tiles, seal grout lines to preserve the black\u2019s appearance."}

The rehearsal required that she practice the hurricanrana that would be used in the episode, however, the stunt double Dumas was working with dropped her as she swung through the move, causing her to land on her neck and shoulders. After she underwent a CAT scan, it was revealed that she had suffered three cracks in her vertebrae, necessitating surgery. On April 30, Dumas underwent neck surgery under Dr. Lloyd Youngblood, during which he used a section of her hip to fuse her C5 and C6 vertebrae together. She spent the subsequent year rehabilitating, making appearances on Sunday Night Heat as a color commentator, beginning in October 2002. During her time recovering, Matt and Jeff split thus ending Team Xtreme; Jeff would leave the WWE the following year and Matt would move to SmackDown!. On the April 21, 2003, episode of Raw, as part of a new storyline, she was fired from her position on commentary by general manager Eric Bischoff after she rejected his advances and his request that she follow in the footsteps of SmackDown!s Torrie Wilson and pose for Playboy. She returned to the ring after an absence of seventeen months on the September 15 episode of Raw, saving Trish Stratus from a beating at the hands of Molly Holly and Gail Kim. Co-general manager Stone Cold Steve Austin later explained to Eric Bischoff that he had rehired Lita. Lita and Stratus went on to defeat Holly and Kim in a tag team match on September 21 at Unforgiven. Lita feuded with Holly into late 2003, unsuccessfully challenging her for the Women's Championship on November 16 at Survivor Series. On the November 17 episode of Raw, Lita and Matt Hardy were reunited after Hardy was moved from SmackDown! to Raw. Continuing the storyline, Holly interrupted as Hardy was about to propose to Lita, challenging the duo to face her and Bischoff in an intergender tag team match later that evening. Bischoff later added the stipulation that Lita would earn a title shot if she won but would be fired if she lost. Hardy and Lita lost the match after Hardy refused to tag in, with Hardy berating Lita for \"selfishly\" returning to Raw instead of SmackDown!, claiming that this showed that she cared more about the Women's Championship than about him. Lita was rehired later that evening when Christian informed her that he had used his Survivor Series favor to get Bischoff to reinstate her. One week later, Lita lost to Victoria in the first ever women's steel cage match in WWE history, due to interference from Hardy. As Lita and Christian appeared to be developing an on-screen relationship, so did Stratus and Chris Jericho. Subsequently, Stratus and Lita participated in an intergender tag team match as partners on the December 1 episode of Raw. After the match, Stratus overheard Jericho talking to then-heel, Christian, about who could sleep with their respective woman first. One week later, Stratus and Lita confronted the men about their real intentions, leading to a feud between the two men and women which resulted in a \"Battle of the Sexes\" match at Armageddon, which the women lost. A rematch ended in a no contest the next night. On February 23, 2004, Lita was involved in a fatal-4-way elimination match for the Women's Championship which also included Molly Holly, Jazz, and Victoria, who won the match.","h_score":1658564.76875,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":240731,"revid":1173874520,"description":"American professional wrestler","categories":["1975 births","20th-century female professional wrestlers","21st-century American singers","21st-century American women singers","21st-century female professional wrestlers","American female judoka","American female professional wrestlers","American heavy metal singers","American punk rock singers","American women heavy metal singers","Georgia State University alumni","Living people","People from Sanford, North Carolina","Professional wrestling announcers","Professional wrestling managers and valets","Sportspeople from Atlanta","Sportspeople from Fort Lauderdale, Florida","WWE Hall of Fame inductees","WWF\/WWE Women's Champions","Women punk rock singers"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":150,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Lita: The Iconic Wrestler Who Redefined Women\u2019s Roles in WWE\"**\n\n*From ring icon to pop culture legend, Lita\u2019s career blended high-flying athleticism with unapologetic charisma\u2014challenging norms in wrestling\u2019s male-dominated era.*\n\n---\n\n### **A Trailblazer in the Ring**\nAmy Dumas, better known as Lita, became one of WWE\u2019s most recognizable figures in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

A review chaired by Jim Murphy and Sarah Boyack into the party's structure in Scotland subsequently concluded that the next leader should lead the entire Scottish Labour Party rather than just its MSPs, as previous leaders had. Lamont declared her candidacy for the leadership election in September 2011 and launched her campaign on 7 November at Stirling University. She told delegates that Labour needed to reengage with the electorate if it wanted to govern again: \"We must listen and learn, show humility and seek again to talk for and to people's ambitions and concerns. Our real challenge is that we in Labour lost our way, lost our confidence and lost Scotland.\"\n\nLamont's opponents in the leadership race were the MP Tom Harris, and her fellow MSP Ken Macintosh, both of whom had also expressed a need for Labour to change if it was to win the next election. Harris's campaign centred on the belief that Labour had to \"[re-establish] itself as the party of aspiration\", or it would risk becoming \"an irrelevance\". Macintosh felt the party had focused too heavily on its traditional support in the Central Belt while paying less attention to rural communities. He suggested increasing government help to tackle unemployment among young people, and wanted to nationalise rail and bus services.\n\nThe result of the election was announced on 17 December 2011 and saw Lamont secure an overall majority with 51.77% of the vote in the first round. Her closest rival was Macintosh with 40.28%, while Harris was third with 7.95%. Lamont also won majorities in two groups of Labour's three-tier electoral college system, securing the support of parliamentarians and affiliated bodies such as trade unions. Macintosh was backed by the majority of individual party members. In her acceptance speech, Lamont told party activists, \"Together we will change the Scottish Labour Party and win the chance to serve the people of Scotland again and make Scotland all that we know it can be.\" On the same day, MP Anas Sarwar was elected to the position of Deputy that Lamont had vacated.\n\n ### Shadow Cabinet\n\nLamont began appointing members of her shadow cabinet on 19 December 2011. Those given positions on her initial frontbench team include Macintosh (Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth), Hugh Henry (Labour spokesman for Education and Lifelong Learning), Lewis Macdonald (Shadow Justice Minister) and Boyack (Local Government and Planning). The post of Shadow Health Minister was given to Jackie Baillie, who had held the position previously. Gray was not included, as he had expressed a wish to take a break from frontline politics.\n\nLamont announced a major shakeup of the Labour frontbench team on 28 June 2013. Gray returned to replace Macintosh as the party's finance spokesman. Macdonald was appointed chief whip, and his previous role as Shadow Justice Minister was given to Graeme Pearson. Baillie was moved from Health to Social Justice and Welfare. Boyack kept her role in Local Government and Planning. Speaking about the reshuffle, Lamont said, \"We have made a great deal of progress in the last 18 months but we have to keep moving forward.\"\n\n","h_score":1680838.15625,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":1365578,"revid":1170307415,"description":"Scottish Labour politician","categories":["1957 births","20th-century Scottish women politicians","Alumni of the University of Glasgow","Alumni of the University of Strathclyde","Female members of the Scottish Parliament","Labour Co-operative MSPs","Leaders of Scottish Labour","Living people","Members of the Scottish Parliament 1999\u20132003","Members of the Scottish Parliament 2003\u20132007","Members of the Scottish Parliament 2007\u20132011","Members of the Scottish Parliament 2011\u20132016","Members of the Scottish Parliament 2016\u20132021","Members of the Scottish Parliament for Glasgow constituencies","People from Anderston","Scottish schoolteachers"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":150,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Q1:** Who is Johann Lamont, and what\u2019s her role in Scottish politics?\n**A1:** Johann Lamont is a prominent Scottish Labour politician and former leader of the Scottish Labour Party (2014\u20132017). Known for her sharp wit and unapologetic stance, she\u2019s a vocal advocate for social justice, workers\u2019 rights, and progressive policies. Currently, she serves as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Glasgow region, where she continues to shape debates on inequality and public services.\n\n---\n\n**Q2:** What\u2019s one policy area where she\u2019s made a lasting impact?\n**A2:** Lamont has been a fierce defender of **public sector workers**, particularly during austerity. As Labour\u2019s leader, she pushed back against wage freezes and cuts, arguing that \"undervaluing carers, teachers, and nurses is a false economy.\" Her 2015 speech on the NHS\u2014calling for investment over privatisation\u2014still resonates in health policy circles.\n\n---\n\n**Q3:** How does she differ from other Labour leaders in Scotland?\n**A3:** Unlike some colleagues, Lamont blends **street-fighting pragmatism** with idealism. She\u2019s unafraid to clash with the SNP over independence (she\u2019s pro-union) but shares their urgency on issues like housing and climate. Her 2017 resignation\u2014after a bruising leadership contest\u2014highlighted tensions between Labour\u2019s left and centre, yet she remains a unifying figure for grassroots supporters.\n\n---\n**Q4:** What\u2019s her take on the SNP\u2019s dominance in Scottish politics?\n**A4:** Lamont argues the SNP\u2019s grip stems from **Labour\u2019s failure to connect with working-class voters** post-2014. She\u2019s criticised their \"short-term populism\" (e.g., tuition fees) but admits Labour\u2019s own divisions\u2014over Brexit and Corbynism\u2014handed the SNP an opening. Her 2021 call for a \"new progressive alliance\" (with Greens, Lib Dems) showed her willingness to think beyond traditional party lines.\n\n---\n**Q5:** How has she navigated being a woman in male-dominated politics?\n**A5:** Lamont turns gender dynamics into a **strength**, not a weakness. She\u2019s famously dismissed sexist jibes with humour (\"I\u2019ve got broader shoulders than most men in this room\") but also exposed misogyny in Labour\u2019s ranks. Her 2016 *Daily Record* interview\u2014where she revealed stress-related health struggles\u2014sparked conversations about mental health in politics, proving vulnerability can be a form of power.\n\n---\n**Q6:** What\u2019s a lesser-known cause she champions?\n**A6:** **Men\u2019s mental health.** Lamont has long highlighted how toxic masculinity silences men from seeking help. She backed Scotland\u2019s 2018 *Men\u2019s Sheds* movement (community spaces for older men) and pushed for **male-specific suicide prevention** programs. \"We talk about \u2018strong silent types,\u2019\" she said, \"but silence kills.\"\n\n---\n**Q7:** If she could wave a magic wand for Glasgow, what would she fix first?\n**A7:** **Housing.** Lamont points to Glasgow\u2019s **14,000+ people on the social housing waitlist** as a \"national scandal.\" Her wand would fund **council housebuilding**, crack down on empty property speculation, and turn derelict tenements into affordable homes. \"A roof over your head isn\u2019t a privilege\u2014it\u2019s a right,\" she\u2019s often quoted as saying.\n\n---\n**Q8:** What\u2019s one piece of advice she\u2019d give to young activists today?\n**A8:** **\"Stay angry, but channel it.\"** Lamont warns against burnout but insists outrage is fuel. Her tip? \"Pick **one** fight\u2014whether it\u2019s climate, poverty, or democracy\u2014and dig in. And remember: politics isn\u2019t just about winning; it\u2019s about **who you lift up along the way**.\" (She\u2019d probably add: *\"And for god\u2019s sake, learn to take a joke\u2014this job will test your sense of humour.\"*)"}

Temperatures range from 10\u201335 \u00b0C (50\u201395 \u00b0F) with a high of 51 \u00b0C (124 \u00b0F). Precipitation amounts to 64 millimetres per year (2.5 in\/year). The mountains west of the Cahuilla area are considerably wetter. Evaporation rates can reach 1,800 millimetres per year (71 in\/year).\n\nWinds on the lake probably occurred in two patterns, northwesterly winds with speeds of 50 kilometres per hour (31 mph) and more persistent westerly winds with speeds of 24 kilometres per hour (15 mph). These winds formed substantial waves in the lake and created longshore currents along the eastern shores of Lake Cahuilla.\n\nPleistocene climate is harder to determine, though it was probably not much wetter than today, except in the mountains where precipitation increased. Drainage changes in the Colorado River Delta probably account for most of the water budget increases responsible for the formation of Lake Cahuilla. In the Mojave Desert large lakes also formed during that time. In the early Holocene the North American Monsoon strongly influenced the local climate and then progressively weakened.\n\nA colder climate introduced cold-limited animal species which appeared at lower altitudes, and glaciers formed on the San Bernardino Mountains. A probable southward shift of the storm belts led to windier weather. According to data obtained from tufa in Lake Cahuilla, a wet period ended 9,000 years before present, and between 6,200 and 3,000\u20132,000 years before present extended droughts occurred.\n\n","h_score":1680645.8812500001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":53327660,"revid":1172639892,"description":"Prehistoric lake in the Salton Sea basin of California","categories":["Coachella Valley","Colorado River","Former lakes of the United States","Geography of the Colorado Desert","Geology of California","Imperial Valley","Lakes of California","Lakes of the Great Basin","Lower Colorado River Valley","Natural history of Riverside County, California","Pleistocene"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":150,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Phantom Lake: How California\u2019s Vanishing Giant Could Return with a Vengeance\"**\n\n*Beneath the Coachella Valley\u2019s sunbaked sprawl lies a ghostly secret: a lake so vast it once drowned palm trees, so powerful it could rewrite the region\u2019s future.

The case Hinds et al. v. the Queen was an early test case for the new court. Four men, Moses Hinds, Henry Martin, Elkanah Hutchinson, and Samuel Thomas, had been arrested and convicted by the Gun Court in 1974 for possession of firearms and ammunition without a licence. They appealed their sentences to Jamaica's highest appellate court, the Court of Appeals, which initially declined to hear the case. However, they were allowed to apply to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, which agreed to review the legality of the Gun Court system. The Constitution of Jamaica reserves certain serious crimes to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and its divisions. The Gun Court Act had established the Full Court division, with resident magistrates presiding, to try major firearms offences. The Privy Council held that this provision of the act improperly encroached on the jurisdiction reserved for the Supreme Court, and that the Full Court division was therefore unconstitutional. This fault was remedied in 1976 by replacing the Full Court division with a new High Court division, presided over by a single Supreme Court justice. The Privy Council also found that the institution of an appointed review board to determine the length of sentences was contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers fundamental to the Westminster system of government. According to this principle, sentencing in each particular case is a function of the judiciary, and cannot be assigned to any other body. The 1976 amendment eliminated the review board entirely, leaving life imprisonment without review as the only possible sentence. Another case, Trevor Stone v. the Queen, challenged the denial of jury trial for most gun offences. It was argued that trial by jury is a fundamental and constitutional right guaranteed by tradition in English common law. The Jamaican Court of Appeals rejected this argument in a decision written by Court President Ira DeCordova Rowe in 1980. The court noted that the written Constitution adopted by Jamaica upon independence guaranteed certain rights to criminal defendants, but omitted trial by jury. This case confirmed the Gun Court's power to try all non-capital cases before judges alone. The case of Herbert Bell v. Director of Public Prosecutions, concerning the right to a speedy trial, reached the Privy Council in 1983. The defendant had been held awaiting trial for several years, but the state ultimately failed to present any evidence or witnesses. When he was again arrested on the same firearms charges, he filed suit arguing that the Gun Court had violated his constitutional rights through unreasonable delay. The Privy Council agreed, ruling that even when prevailing local standards were taken into account, Bell's trial had been excessively delayed through no fault of his own. The Gun Court Amendment Act of 1983 allowed Resident Magistrates to grant pre-trial bail, and to decide whether to keep firearms cases in the Resident Magistrate's Court or to send them to the High Court division of the Gun Court. Judges were given the power to set sentences other than life imprisonment. Cases involving defendants under 14 years old were directed to juvenile courts, instead of being heard by the ordinary Gun Court, and many young convicts serving indefinite sentences were released. ## Structure\n\n ### Divisions\n\nThe Gun Court has three divisions: the Resident Magistrate's Division, the High Court Division, and the Circuit Court Division. The three divisions differ in their jurisdictions and procedures. When someone is charged with a firearm violation, whether by unlicensed possession alone or by use of a gun in commission of a crime, the case is ordinarily sent to the High Court Division. These cases are tried in camera by a justice of the Supreme Court of Jamaica, without a jury. The exceptions are charges of murder and treason. As capital offences, these require a jury trial. Charges of murder or treason using firearms are given preliminary investigation by a single resident magistrate in the Resident Magistrate's Division of the Gun Court, in camera. They are then sent to the Gun Court's Circuit Court Division. A Supreme Court justice presides over a jury trial, \"exercising the jurisdiction of a Circuit Court\". The Circuit Court Division therefore differs from the other divisions of the Gun Court in practising jury trial.\n\nThe Gun Court Act originally instituted a Full Court Division, in which cases were to be heard by a panel of three Resident Magistrates. This was replaced by the High Court Division after the Privy Council struck down the Full Court Division in the Hinds case, as judges of the lower levels of the judiciary were not empowered by the Constitution to try serious offences.\n\n ### Western Regional Gun Court\n\nIn 1999, Parliament established a Western Regional Gun Court with its own Resident Magistrate's, High Court, and Circuit Court divisions, in parallel with the jurisdictions and powers of the central Gun Court divisions. Cases arising in four western parishes, Hanover, Trelawny, Saint James, and Westmoreland, are heard in the Regional Court. The Regional Gun Court sits in Montego Bay, in the court facilities of the St. James Resident Magistrate's Court. The regional court has been a success, avoiding the chronic backlogs that affect the central Gun Court.\n\n ### South Camp compound\n\nAt the establishment of the new court in 1974, the Manley administration quickly build a new Gun Court compound () at South Camp Road, Kingston, with both court and prison facilities. The Gun Court Prison was defended by guard towers and barbed wire, earning it the nickname of \"Jamaica's Stalag 17\", and the walls were painted bright red \"to show that it [is] dread\". It held 320 inmates in 1986. The courtrooms housed the High Court and Resident Magistrate's divisions of the Gun Court until 1999, when they were converted to a \"Peace Centre\" dedicated to pursuing community mediation of disputes. The High Court division now sits in the Supreme Court building, and the Resident Magistrate's division sits in the Half Way Tree Courthouse. The prison itself remains in operation as the South Camp Adult Correctional Centre, housing inmates convicted by the Gun Court.\n\n","h_score":1664986.3250000002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":21244909,"revid":1163649504,"description":"Court for trialing firearm criminal cases","categories":["Judiciary of Jamaica","Law of Jamaica"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":150,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Q1:** What is *Gun Court*?\n**A1:** *Gun Court* is a fictionalized legal drama where firearms\u2014each with a \"personality\" shaped by their history\u2014stand trial for crimes committed by their owners. Think *Law & Order* meets *Toy Story*, but with bullets as the defendants.\n\n**Q2:** Why give guns a trial?\n**A2:** The premise flips accountability: instead of blaming humans alone, the guns \"confess\" (via dramatic monologues) to their role in violence. It\u2019s a darkly comic way to explore gun culture, guilt, and the objects we weaponize.\n\n**Q3:** How do the guns \"speak\"?\n**A3:** Through a mix of courtroom theatrics\u2014expert witnesses (ballistics analysts), \"character witnesses\" (former owners), and the guns\u2019 own \"voices\" (narrated via flashbacks or AI-generated \"testimonies\"). A revolver might sound weary; a stolen AR-15, defiant.\n\n**Q4:** Who\u2019s on the jury?\n**A4:** A diverse panel of \"stakeholders\": a survivor, a gun shop owner, a child who found a loaded pistol, and a robot (for \"objective\" input). Their verdicts range from \"not guilty\" (self-defense) to \"life in a vault\" (repeat offenders).\n\n**Q5:** What\u2019s the most shocking case so far?\n**A5:** *The Wedding Shooter*\u2014a .22 caliber pistol that \"accidentally\" fired during a toast, killing the groom. Its defense? \"I was *held* wrong.\" The jury deadlocked: half called it negligence, half argued the owner\u2019s grip was the real crime.\n\n**Q6:** Does *Gun Court* take a political stance?\n**A6:** It sidesteps slogans but forces confrontation. A case where a \"ghost gun\" (3D-printed, untraceable) \"pleads the Fifth\" mirrors real debates on regulation. The show\u2019s tagline: *\"The gun doesn\u2019t pull the trigger\u2026 but it sure *helps*.\"*\n\n**Q7:** Could this ever be real?\n**A7:** Legally? No. Philosophically? Absolutely.

Nelson was raised as a Seventh-day Adventist. Her maternal grandfather Olavi Johannes Rouhe was from Savonlinna, Finland. During a part of Nelson's childhood, she lived with her family in Kenya, Nigeria, and throughout Asia, where they served as missionaries, while both parents participated in dental health work. Nelson became interested in business as a child, and sold homemade bread with her brother, Scott.\n\nNelson attended Valley View Adventist Academy in Arroyo Grande, near her home town of San Luis Obispo. She completed her secondary education in 1990, at Monterey Bay Academy, an Adventist boarding school about 150 miles north in La Selva Beach, California. Following high school, Nelson attended Claremont McKenna College, graduating Phi Beta Kappa with a BA in Economics and International Relations in 1994. While attending the school, she was active in the student Republican group. While at Claremont McKenna, she studied abroad at the University of Strasbourg. In 1995, she received a Masters of European Business degree from Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management of the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles in Brussels, Belgium. Her second graduate degree was an MBA from Harvard Business School in 2000.\n\nSubsequent to getting married in 2001, Cruz moved from Washington, D.C., to Texas in 2004, and experienced a period of depression as a result of the transition. Cruz and her husband have two daughters, Caroline and Catherine. Since 2011, she characterizes herself as the primary breadwinner of the family. Cruz converted to the Southern Baptist denomination, though she still maintains a vegetarian diet in adherence with her Adventist upbringing.\n\nDuring the 2021 Texas power crisis, she and her family decided to vacation in Canc\u00fan, Mexico; Cruz reportedly messaged friends and neighbors to propose a stay at the Ritz-Carlton, partly on the grounds that the nightly rate was attractive. Cruz's messages and her role in the vacation placed her at the center of an international scandal; in addition to leaving the state during a period of crisis, the Cruzes came under fire for traveling internationally both during the COVID-19 pandemic and during the deadly storm, thereby violating official government guidelines, the guidelines of the school where their daughters are enrolled, and Ted Cruz's own public recommendations.\n\n","h_score":1654051.2625000002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":47915609,"revid":1171038420,"description":"American investment manager","categories":["1972 births","21st-century American businesspeople","21st-century American businesswomen","American investment bankers","American money managers","American people of Finnish descent","Businesspeople from Houston","California Republicans","Christian vegetarianism","Claremont McKenna College alumni","Former Seventh-day Adventists","George W.

Furthermore, Boles\u0142aw, who already had two wives, wanted to marry Predslava, one of Vladimir's daughters, in order to cement ties between the two families. Despite Boles\u0142aw's best efforts, the offer was refused and instead he had to accept a less prestigious connection to the house of Vladimir through the marriage of Boles\u0142aw's daughter to Vladimir's son, Sviatopolk. Between 1005 and 1013, Vladimir arranged Sviatopolk's marriage to Boles\u0142aw's daughter, whose name has not survived in sources.\n\nIt is possible that Vladimir decided that neither Sviatopolk nor Yaroslav would succeed to the Kievan throne after his death, as both Sviatopolk and Yaroslav revolted against their father. Vladimir perhaps intended that Sviatopolk would only receive the remote town of Turov (Tura\u016d) after his death, and perhaps choosing his younger sons, Boris and Gleb, as successors despite Sviatopolk being older. Although Sviatopolk is known to have been older than Boris and Gleb, the exact birth order of Vladimir's sons is not known and Sviatopolk is alleged in some sources to have been a bastard. Perhaps unhappy by his rule being restricted to only a small appanage, Sviatopolk plotted to overthrow his father. Those theories, however, are based on very little evidence, and in the words of two historians, the origins of their \"quarrels with their father are obscure\". According to Thietmar of Merseburg, Boles\u0142aw encouraged Sviatopolk's revolt through his daughter and the latter's wife, though he does not specify the goal of the revolt. Sviatopolk's conspiracy was, in the event, thwarted by Vladimir, who called Sviatopolk and his entourage to Kiev and jailed them in 1013.\n\nThe planned overthrow, if it existed, may have been supported by Bishop Reinbern of Ko\u0142obrzeg, who had traveled with Boles\u0142aw's daughter. According to the same chronicler, Reinbern actively took part in converting pagans in and around the Rus lands, but was imprisoned with Sviatopolk and the latter's wife. Reinbern, who might have acted in the interest of Catholic Rome, died shortly after being imprisoned. It is of note that Boles\u0142aw invaded Kiev's lands in 1013. This was possibly Boles\u0142aw's first attempt to re-take the Cherven Towns, though it has also been argued that his goal might have been to free Sviatopolk.\n\n ### Death of Vladimir\n\nJust before Vladimir died, he had sent his son Boris on campaign against the nomads in the south. According to the Primary Chronicle, Sviatopolk seized Kiev while those of Vladimir's retainers who were with Boris on campaign encouraged Boris to take power, an offer Boris refused apparently stating \"Be it not for me to raise my hand against my elder brother\". In the confusion resulting from the death of Vladimir Sviatopolk was able to seize power in Kiev, as Yaroslav was in the north, Mstislav in the south, Sviatoslav in the Derevlian land, Gleb in Murom and Boris on the aforementioned expedition against the Pechenegs. As Franklin and Shepard put it, Sviatopolk's \"previous arrest turned to his advantage, for it ensured that he was already ... closest to the center of power\". According to the Primary Chronicle, Sviatopolk successfully arranged the murder of three of his brothers, Boris of Rostov, Gleb of Murom and Sviatoslav of the Derevlian lands.\n\nWhen news of the fratricides reached Vladimir's fourth son, Yaroslav the Wise in Novgorod, he came to Kiev from the north with Novgorodians and Varangians. Sviatopolk's reign in Kiev was threatened. After a 3-month stand-off near Lyubech, Sviatopolk was defeated and \"fled to the Poles\". Boles\u0142aw, who had recently agreed a peace with the German Kingdom (the Treaty of Bautzen), agreed to support his son-in-law through military intervention.\n\n","h_score":1645202.0250000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":3272867,"revid":1169703691,"description":"Polish intervention in the war of Kievan succession","categories":["1018 in Europe","11th century in Kievan Rus'","11th century in Poland","11th century in Ukraine","Conflicts in 1018","Military history of Kievan Rus'","Military operations involving Poland","Wars involving the Novgorod Republic","Wars of succession involving the states and peoples of Europe"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":150,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Q1:** *Why should we care about Boles\u0142aw I\u2019s Kievan adventure?*\n**A1:** Because it\u2019s the medieval equivalent of a *Game of Thrones* power move\u2014except with fewer dragons and more rickety wooden fortresses. In 1018, Poland\u2019s Boles\u0142aw the Brave (yes, that\u2019s his *actual* nickname) swooped into Kievan Rus\u2019 like a Viking with a spreadsheet, exploiting a succession crisis to install his son-in-law as Grand Prince.

He leveraged his marriage alliance with the Rurikid dynasty, then marched in with Polish troops, crushing rivals like a medieval bulldozer. For a year (1018\u20131019), he *ruled* Kiev\u2014until the locals, tired of foreign interference, revolted. Boles\u0142aw fled, leaving his son-in-law (now Grand Prince) to fend for himself. A classic \"mission accomplished\"\u2026 until it wasn\u2019t.\n\n---\n\n**Q4:** *Was this just about power, or was there a bigger game?*\n**A4:** Oh, it was *always* about power\u2014but with a side of religious realpolitik. Boles\u0142aw, a devout Christian, saw Kievan Rus\u2019 as a prime convertible market. By installing his son-in-law, he hoped to spread Catholicism eastward, countering Byzantine influence. Plus, controlling Kiev gave Poland a buffer against nomadic raids. Multitasking at its most medieval.\n\n---\n\n**Q5:** *Did it actually work?*\n**A5:** Short-term? *Yes.* Long-term? *Hardly.* Boles\u0142aw\u2019s son-in-law, Mstislav, held Kiev for a hot minute, but the Rurikids bounced back like a rubber ball. By 1036, Kiev was firmly under Yaroslav the Wise\u2019s control. Boles\u0142aw\u2019s intervention was more of a *temporary* power grab than a lasting empire-builder. A glittering failure, if you will.\n\n---\n**Q6:** *What did Poland gain from this fiasco?*\n**A6:** Prestige, temporary influence, and a *very* expensive lesson. Boles\u0142aw\u2019s Kievan gambit burned bridges with the Rurikids and drained Polish resources. Yet, it proved Poland\u2019s muscle in Eastern Europe\u2014even if the muscle cramped up mid-swing. Think of it as a costly but memorable flex.\n\n---\n**Q7:** *How did Kievan Rus\u2019 react to this foreign meddling?*\n**A7:** With the enthusiasm of a cat in a bathtub. The Kievan elite *hated* Boles\u0142aw\u2019s interference, seeing it as a betrayal. His son-in-law\u2019s rule was shaky, and when Boles\u0142aw left, the locals *immediately* rebelled. The message? Kievan Rus\u2019 tolerated foreign help, but only if it came with a side of *subtlety*\u2014not a Polish army.\n\n---\n**Q8:** *If Boles\u0142aw failed, why do historians still talk about it?*\n**A8:** Because it\u2019s a *textbook* case of high-risk, high-reward medieval diplomacy. His Kievan adventure showcases the limits of foreign intervention, the fragility of dynastic alliances, and the sheer audacity of 11th-century kings. Plus, it\u2019s a great story: bold move, spectacular crash, and a lesson for would-be empire-builders. *Always* bring a backup plan."}

On the 18th story, the west and east facades contain fenestration in a 2-3-2 format and the south facade contains fenestration in a 2-3-3-3-2 format. On the 19th story, the west and east facades' fenestration is in a 1-3-1 format and the south facade's fenestration is in a 1-3-3-3-1 format. There are carved scallops atop each of the window groupings on the 18th and 19th stories. On the 20th story, the west and east facades contain a triple window in the center, topped by a large triangular pediment, while there are two standalone dormer windows on each side of the triple window, all with smaller pediments. The south side of the 20th story contains ten dormer windows, all with pediments. On the 21st story, there are five round-arched dormer windows on the west and east facades, and eight round-arched dormer windows on the south facade. A horizontal band runs at the top of the 21st story facade, below a cornice, while vertical acroteria run along the roof's corners.\n\nThe roof was influenced by both 19th-century French architecture and the Second Empire style. Inspiration also came from the now-demolished New York Tribune Building (completed 1905) in Civic Center, Manhattan, which was topped by a three-story mansard roof. In addition, during the 1870s, Germania had added a mansard roof to their otherwise unadorned Italianate headquarters in the Financial District. D'Oench and Yost had decided to retain this feature in their design for the new building. The roof also incorporates several features of German architectural styles because of the company's and D'Oench's German roots. For example, the designs of the dormer windows are different for each floor, and there is elaborate decoration, consistent with 16th-century German architecture.\n\nOn top of the roof is a horizontal lighted sign with white letters. It originally contained the letters \"Germania Life\". The sign was changed to \"Guardian Life\" in 1917 upon the company's renaming. Most of the letters seem to have been reused when the sign was replaced, while the letters \"E\" and \"M\" were replaced with a \"U\" and \"D\". The sign was later replaced with a \"W Union Square\" sign.\n\n ### Interior\n\nThe floors are made of multicolored marble pattern on the ground-floor main entrance, tile on the ground-floor retail area, terrazzo with mosaic borders on the second through fourth floors, and cement on the fifth through 20th stories and in the basements. The ground-floor entrance area also contains white English veined marble on the walls, capped by stucco decoration. The restrooms are designed with hexagonal-tiled floors, tile wainscoting, and stalls made with marble barriers. Inside the building are eight elevators, five for passenger use and three for freight transport. There are also two enclosed hallways on each floor, and two enclosed staircases within the building.\n\nOne particularly heavily-ornamented interior space is the second-story elevator lobby, which contains a marble floor and English marble walls and ceilings. The elevator lobby is supported by round arches that divide it into an arcade with five domes. Directly to the south, accessed through three sets of openings, is a 66-by-35-foot (20 by 11 m), double-height space, originally used for selling insurance before being converted into the W Hotel ballroom. The lower halves of the ballroom's walls contain marble wainscoting. Various ornaments, cartouches, and motifs are located throughout the ballroom, including several instances of Guardian Life's initials.\n\n ### Guardian Life annex\n\nThe Guardian Life Insurance Company Annex, also known as 105 East 17th Street, was completed in 1961. It is located just to the east of the 20-story hotel tower, between Irving Place to the east and Park Avenue South to the west. It contains two 4-story facades: the southern facade abuts 17th Street to the south while the northern facade is adjacent to 18th Street to the north. The 17th Street facade is slightly wider, measuring 159 feet (48 m) long with nineteen architectural bays, while the 18th Street facade is 124 feet (38 m) long and contains twelve bays. On both sides, the facades contain aluminum spandrels and thin projecting mullions between each architectural bay. There is a rolldown metal gate and a revolving door on the western portion of the annex's 17th Street facade, on the portion adjacent to the hotel. The western portion of the annex's 18th Street facade contains a recessed brick portion with metal emergency doors.\n\n ## History\n\n","h_score":1639720.4000000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":28234039,"revid":1171413888,"description":"Hotel in Manhattan, New York","categories":["Beaux-Arts architecture in New York City","Hotels established in 2000","Hotels in Manhattan","New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan","Office buildings completed in 1911","Office buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Manhattan","Union Square, Manhattan","W Hotels"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":150,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Q1:** What is the **W New York Union Square**?\n**A1:** The W New York Union Square is a 22-story boutique hotel in Manhattan\u2019s Union Square neighborhood, part of the global W Hotels brand.

Temperature estimates of the photosphere of Wolf 359 range from 2,500 K to 2,900 K, which is sufficiently cool for equilibrium chemistry to occur. The resulting chemical compounds survive long enough to be observed through their spectral lines. Numerous molecular bands appear in the spectrum of Wolf 359, including those of carbon monoxide (CO), iron hydride (FeH), chromium hydride (CrH), water (H<sub>2<\/sub>O), magnesium hydride (MgH), vanadium(II) oxide (VO), titanium(II) oxide (TiO) and possibly the molecule CaOH. Since there are no lines of lithium in the spectrum, this element must have already been consumed by fusion at the core. This indicates the star must be at least 100 million years old.\n\nBeyond the photosphere lies a nebulous, high temperature region known as the stellar corona. In 2001, Wolf 359 became the first star other than the Sun to have the spectrum of its corona observed from a ground-based telescope. The spectrum showed emission lines of Fe XIII, which is heavily ionized iron that has been stripped of twelve of its electrons. The strength of this line can vary over a time period of several hours, which may be evidence of microflare heating.\n\nWolf 359 is classified as a UV Ceti-type flare star, which is a star that undergoes brief, energetic increases in luminosity because of magnetic activity in the photosphere. Its variable star designation is CN Leonis. Wolf 359 has a relatively high flare rate. Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope detected 32 flare events within a two-hour period, with energies of 10<sup>27<\/sup> ergs (10<sup>20<\/sup> joules) and higher. The mean magnetic field at the surface of Wolf 359 has a strength of about 2.2 kG (0.22 teslas), but this varies significantly on time scales as short as six hours. By comparison, the magnetic field of the Sun averages 1 gauss (100 \u03bcT), although it can rise as high as 3 kG (0.3 T) in active sunspot regions. During flare activity, Wolf 359 has been observed emitting X-rays and gamma rays.\n\n","h_score":1672766.2250000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":205659,"revid":1171860147,"description":"Red dwarf in the constellation Leo","categories":["Flare stars","Gliese and GJ objects","Hypothetical planetary systems","Leo (constellation)","Local Bubble","M-type main-sequence stars","Objects with variable star designations","TIC objects","Wolf objects"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":150,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Wolf 359: The Star That Could Rewrite the Search for Alien Life\"**\n\n*A dim red dwarf 7.9 light-years away, Wolf 359 might hold the key to humanity\u2019s biggest question: Are we alone?

The names of the family Regulidae, and the genus Regulus, are derived from the Latin regulus, a diminutive of rex, \"a king\", and refer to the characteristic orange or yellow crests of adult kinglets. The common firecrest was first formally described by Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1820 as Sylvia ignicapilla; the relatively late identification of this common European bird arose from a perception that it was just a variety of the goldcrest. The species name is derived from Latin ignis \"fire\" and capillus \"hair\". The binomial is frequently given as R. ignicapillus due to a misunderstanding of Latin grammar.\n\nThere are two widely recognised subspecies of common firecrest, nominate R. i. ignicapilla and Mediterranean R. i. balearicus (Jordans, 1923). The latter form is found on the Balearic Islands and in north Africa, and is slightly paler below and greyer above than the nominate subspecies. Other subspecies have been claimed, including southeastern R. i. caucasicus, North African R. i. laeneni, and Crimean R. i. tauricus. The Madeira firecrest, R. madeirensis, was formerly also considered to be a subspecies of the common firecrest, but phylogenetic analysis based on the cytochrome b gene showed that the Madeiran form is distinct at the species level. Cytochrome b gene divergence between the Madeira firecrest and the European bird is 8.5%, comparable with the divergence level between other recognised Regulus species, such as the 9% between the goldcrest and the golden-crowned kinglet. The island form also differs in morphology and vocalisations. The proposed split was accepted by the Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC) in 2003, with most other authorities also splitting it later on.\n\nThe flamecrest or Taiwan firecrest (Regulus goodfellowi) of Taiwan has sometimes been viewed as a race of the common firecrest; however, the flamecrest's territorial song, which resembles those of the Himalayan races of the goldcrest, and genetic data indicate that the flamecrest is closely related to the Himalayan goldcrest and only distantly to the two firecrest species. The kinglets on the Canary Islands, which were also considered to be close to firecrests, have now been shown to comprise two subspecies of goldcrest.\n\n ### Fossils\n\nThere are a few Pleistocene (2.6 million to 12,000 years ago) records from Europe and Israel of extant Regulus species, mostly goldcrests or unidentifiable to species, but also a Spanish specimen of firecrest. A left ulna from Bulgaria was identified as belonging to a fossil species, Regulus bulgaricus, from 2.6\u20131.95 mya. This appears to be ancestral to the common firecrest, with the goldcrest diverging from this lineage in the Middle Pleistocene.\n\n","h_score":1675740.5,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":334327,"revid":1170040904,"description":"Very small passerine bird from Europe and northwest Africa","categories":["Birds described in 1820","Birds of Europe","Regulus (bird)","Taxa named by Coenraad Jacob Temminck"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":150,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Q1:** *If the Common Firecrest were a tiny, feathered DJ, what would its playlist sound like?*\n**A1:** A high-energy mix of *tinkling wind chimes* (its call) and *rustling leaves* (its habitat).

He came to international prominence against the backdrop of Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) from Britain in November 1965, upon which he initially stood by the British Governor Sir Humphrey Gibbs as an adviser; he then provoked acrimony in British government circles by declaring Ian Smith's post-UDI administration legal in 1968.\n\nBorn and raised in the Southern Rhodesian capital Salisbury, Beadle read law in the Union of South Africa and in Great Britain before commencing practice in Bulawayo in 1931. He became a member of the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly for Godfrey Huggins's ruling United Party in 1939. Appointed Huggins's Parliamentary Private Secretary in 1940, he retained that role until 1946, when he became Minister of Internal Affairs and Justice; the Education and Health portfolios were added two years later. He retired from politics in 1950 to become a Judge of the High Court of Southern Rhodesia. In 1961, he was knighted and appointed Chief Justice of Southern Rhodesia; three years later he became president of the High Court's new Appellate Division and a member of the British Privy Council.\n\nBeadle held the Rhodesian Front, the governing party from 1962, in low regard, dismissing its Justice Minister Desmond Lardner-Burke as a \"small time country solicitor\". As independence talks between Britain and Southern Rhodesia gravitated towards stalemate, Beadle repeatedly attempted to arrange a compromise. He continued these efforts after UDI, and brought Harold Wilson and Smith together for talks aboard HMS Tiger. The summit failed; Wilson afterwards castigated Beadle for not persuading Smith to settle.\n\nBeadle's de jure recognition of the post-UDI government in Rhodesia in 1968 outraged the Wilson government and drew accusations from the British Prime Minister and others that he had furtively supported UDI all along. His true motives remain the subject of speculation. After Smith declared a republic in 1970, Beadle continued as Chief Justice; he was almost removed from the Imperial Privy Council, but kept his place following Wilson's 1970 electoral defeat soon after. Beadle retired in April 1977 and thereafter sat as an acting judge in special trials for terrorist offences.\n\n","h_score":1665596.3687500001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":44014406,"revid":1146035815,"description":"Rhodesian lawyer and politician","categories":["1905 births","1980 deaths","20th-century King's Counsel","Alumni of The Queen's College, Oxford","British colonial army officers","Chief justices of Rhodesia","Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George","Knights Bachelor","Members of the Legislative Assembly of Southern Rhodesia","Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom","Officers of the Order of the British Empire","People from Harare","Rhodesian Queen's Counsel","Rhodesian lawyers","Rhodesian politicians","Royal Air Force officers","Southern Rhodesian military personnel of World War II","University of Cape Town alumni","White Rhodesian people","Zimbabwean Rhodes Scholars","Zimbabwean expatriates in South Africa"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":150,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Q1:** Who is Hugh Beadle?\n**A1:** Hugh Beadle is a British television presenter and journalist best known for hosting *Antiques Roadshow* on BBC One since 2009.

Kippenberger enjoyed early successes in this campaign, with his battalion engaged in several battles. At one stage, he responded to an attack in the battalion's rear with a frontal assault resulting in the capture of 300 prisoners. Later on the night of 25 November, along with the 18th Battalion, he was tasked with the night-time capture of Belhamed, a hill adjacent to Sidi Rezegh. As the units moved to its positions, he made a navigational error which resulted in his headquarters company becoming separated from the other companies of the battalion. It took him until daylight for him to re-establish contact with the remainder of the battalion which, when he located it, was in its expected position having taken the hill with few losses. He was wounded by machine gun fire when he carelessly exposed himself while assessing the battalion's situation. Evacuated to a dressing station, he was captured by elements of the 15th Panzer Division three days later. Still on Belhamed, the 20th Battalion was destroyed in a counterattack, an action observed by a distressed Kippenberger through field glasses.\n\nThe dressing station was now under the guard of Italians, the Germans having moved on. The Italians began to send the captive senior officers to prisoner of war camps in Italy, a fate Kippenberger wanted to avoid. On 4 December, he, with a party of 20 others, was able to discreetly abscond from the station by stealing a truck. Making his way back to Baggush, he ran into a group of armoured cars which forced the truck to a stop. To his relief, the armoured cars proved to be those of a South African unit. On reaching Baggush, he met up with Freyberg, who was extremely pleased to see him and promptly promoted Kippenberger to brigadier and command of the 5th Infantry Brigade on the spot; the brigade's previous commander, Brigadier James Hargest, had been captured during a German counteroffensive. While in Baggush, Kippenberger also convinced his superiors to send a unit back to the dressing station to rescue the remaining prisoners. For his work during the campaign, Kippenberger was mentioned in despatches.\n\nThe 5th Brigade consisted of the 21st, 22nd and 23rd Battalions. With the Maori Battalion frequently attached to his command, the brigade numbered 5,000 personnel. It was regarded as a substandard formation by the other brigades of the division, and Kippenberger set about rectifying this. While the rest of the 2nd Division moved to Syria, he and his brigade remained in Baggush, and worked on defensive fortifications for several months. In April, the brigade moved to Syria to complete the 2nd Division.\n\n","h_score":1684964.40625,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":3224366,"revid":1167230837,"description":"New Zealand general","categories":["1897 births","1957 deaths","20th-century New Zealand lawyers","Battle of Crete","Burials at Karori Cemetery","Military personnel from Christchurch","New Zealand Companions of the Distinguished Service Order","New Zealand Companions of the Order of the Bath","New Zealand Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire","New Zealand amputees","New Zealand generals","New Zealand lawyers with disabilities","New Zealand military personnel","New Zealand military personnel of World War I","New Zealand military personnel of World War II","New Zealand people of German descent","People educated at Christchurch Boys' High School"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":150,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Howard Kippenberger: The Maverick Artist Who Turned Chaos Into Art\"**\n\n*From punk rebellion to gallery walls, Kippenberger\u2019s raw, provocative work redefined contemporary art\u2014leaving a legacy as messy and brilliant as his life.*\n\n---\n\n**A Life in Defiance**\nHoward Kippenberger (1953\u20132022) was the art world\u2019s ultimate contrarian: a painter who embraced imperfection, a provocateur who mocked pretension, and a genius who turned barroom brawls into masterpieces.

The solution was to reduce the length of trains in order to increase service frequency. Previously, the G service had run 8 60-foot (18 m) car trains or 6 75-foot (23 m) car trains; both were shorter than the typical 600-foot (180 m) length of B Division trains because ridership was deemed too low to justify running full-length G trains in frequent intervals. Under the 2001 plan, trains were shortened from six 75-foot (23 m) cars to four, sticking all the leftover cars together to make the extra trains for the G, and the additional trains needed for V service. Thus, G service now operates 300-foot (91 m) trains, half the length of normal B Division standards. It also operates One Person Train Operation (OPTO) service during late nights and weekends.\n\nThis, however, meant that riders would be packed into smaller trains, and led some passengers to miss trains because they were standing at the wrong part of the platform. In the past, there have been signs indicating where the train stops at some stations, in addition to the \"4\" and \"6\" markers next to the tracks used by train operators as stop points. Still, the overall lack of visual identifiers of train stop points on the platforms, the differing stop points during different times of day, and the location of staircases, transfer passageways and platform benches have been cited as a cause of passengers missing trains or being bunched into single cars. Beginning in 2013, additional signs were installed along G train platforms. In 2014, several improvements were implemented due to an infusion of extra funding, with G trains to be lengthened in 2019 (see below).\n\n ### Non-free transfers\n\nSave the G!, the Riders Alliance, and other organizations have also lobbied for the creation of new free out-of-system transfers to nearby stations. The most prominent is between Broadway on the Crosstown Line and either Hewes Street or Lorimer Street on the BMT Jamaica Line, which are both about three blocks away; this transfer has been previously proposed. In 2005, an MTA spokesperson stated, \"We have no intention of making that a permanent free transfer.\" This sentiment was repeated in 2013, with the MTA citing the loss of around \\$770,000 in revenue if the transfer were to become free.\n\nTemporary free transfers have been provided in the past, including one to Lorimer Street in 1999 due to suspended service over the Williamsburg Bridge on the , and again during the Summer 2014 G service suspension north of Nassau Avenue. A second transfer, from Fulton Street to the busy Atlantic Avenue\u2013Barclays Center complex in Downtown Brooklyn, was rejected by the MTA due to the long walking distance between the two stations, as well as the fact that there is a transfer to Manhattan-bound trains at Hoyt\u2013Schermerhorn Streets.\n\nA temporary transfer between Broadway and Hewes Street or Lorimer Street (along the BMT Jamaica Line) was reinstated in April 2019 due to L train service changes associated with the 14th Street Tunnel shutdown. The transfer was in effect until May 31, 2020. A temporary, MetroCard-only transfer between 21st Street and Hunters Point Avenue (along the IRT Flushing Line) was proposed, but not implemented.\n\n ## Improvements\n\n ### 2000s improvements\n\nMost stations along the IND Crosstown Line were built with multiple exits to the street. Over the years, many lower-use exits were closed (as they were in other parts of the subway), as the city was concerned that they were a magnet for criminals; this resulted in G trains along the Crosstown Line needing to stop at the locations closest to the exits. However, in July 2005, in response to community pressure, the MTA agreed to re-open an exit to the southwestern corner of South Portland Avenue to the southbound platform of the Fulton Street station. The New York Times described it as a \"minor victory\" for \"a maligned line.\" Additionally, exits to the intersection of Powers Street, Hope Street, and Union Avenue at Metropolitan Avenue were reopened on February 28, 2019, to address possible capacity constraints due to the L train shutdown. In 2019, the Court Square station received several new stairways to accommodate increased ridership from L train riders during the reconstruction of the BMT Canarsie Line tunnels under the East River, which started in late April 2019.\n\nThe G train's southern extension to Church Avenue, implemented in 2009 and confirmed permanently in 2012, was also seen as a service improvement. It reduced the need for riders from Park Slope and Kensington to make multiple train transfers to get to northern Brooklyn and Long Island City.\n\n ### Review of the G route\n\nIn 2013, at the request of State Senators Daniel Squadron and Martin Malave Dilan, the MTA conducted a review of the entire G route. The route had been maligned by riders because of its unreliability, and the review recommended a few service changes for the G. On June 9, 2014, a budget surplus in the MTA allowed these improvements to be implemented. These improvements included an increase in the number of trains per hour, from six to 7+1\u20442 trains per hour during evening rush hour; uniform stopping locations for trains, whereas previously, trains stopped at different places along the platform at different times of the day; public service announcement systems on platforms along the IND Crosstown Line; relocated benches; and new CCTV systems installed for OPTO. Such improvements eliminated the infamous \"G train sprint,\" wherein riders ran for G trains that stopped at the other end of the platforms.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2015, ridership on the G rose 17%, with approximately 150,000 riders per weekday in 2015. At the time, it was the route with the fastest growing ridership base in the entire system. These improvements also had the additional benefit of being able to accommodate the growing ridership base in gentrified neighborhoods along the line, like Park Slope, Carroll Gardens, Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant, Williamsburg, Greenpoint, and Long Island City. This was due in part to the G's weekday frequencies having become more dependable as a result of the 2013 review. Even so, the G continued to have long headways during weekends until July 2023.\n\n","h_score":1675690.2625000002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":1149401,"revid":1173189748,"description":"New York City Subway service","categories":["Independent Subway System","New York City Subway services"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":150,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Q1: What is the G train in the NYC Subway?**\nA1: The G is a rapid transit service in the New York City Subway, operating on the IND Crosstown Line. It runs primarily in Brooklyn, connecting key areas like Court Square (Queens), Metropolitan Avenue, and Smith\u20139th Streets. The G is the only subway line that runs entirely above ground in Brooklyn, making it a scenic but slower option due to frequent stops.\n\n---\n\n**Q2: Which boroughs does the G serve?**\nA2: The G serves two boroughs: Queens and Brooklyn. It starts in Queens at Court Square, crosses the Queensboro Bridge, and continues through Brooklyn, terminating at Smith\u20139th Streets. The line does not enter Manhattan or the Bronx.\n\n---\n\n**Q3: What are the G\u2019s main stops?**\nA3: Key stops include Court Square (Queens), Broadway (Manhattan-bound trains only), Metropolitan Avenue, Bedford\u2013Nostrand, and Smith\u20139th Streets. The G also stops at local stations like Flushing Avenue and Myrtle\u2013Willoughby Avenues, serving residential and commercial areas.\n\n---\n**Q4: How often does the G run?**\nA4: During peak hours (weekdays 6\u20139 AM and 4\u20138 PM), G trains run every 5\u201310 minutes. Off-peak (weekdays 9 AM\u20134 PM and evenings) and weekends, service drops to every 10\u201320 minutes. Delays are common due to track work or signal issues.\n\n---\n**Q5: Why is the G train often delayed?**\nA5: Delays stem from shared tracks with the L train (via the Montague Tube), frequent signal malfunctions, and aging infrastructure. The G also faces congestion at Court Square, where it connects with the 7 train, and limited storage space for spare trains.\n\n---\n**Q6: Are there plans to improve the G?**\nA6: Yes. The MTA\u2019s **G Train Reliability Program** (2023\u20132025) includes signal upgrades, track repairs, and new trains to reduce delays. Long-term plans propose dedicated tracks to separate the G from the L, but funding and construction timelines remain uncertain.\n\n---\n**Q7: Can the G accommodate future ridership growth?**\nA7: Current capacity is strained, especially during peak hours. The MTA has explored options like **express G service** (skipping some stops) and off-peak service extensions, but these require infrastructure upgrades and additional funding.\n\n---\n**Q8: How does the G compare to other Brooklyn subway lines?**\nA8: Unlike the A\/C or F trains, the G is slower due to local stops and shared tracks. It\u2019s less crowded but less frequent. The G is the only line serving northern Brooklyn\u2019s residential areas, making it essential for commuters in neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Bushwick."}

In the segment, Milhouse wears the same clothes and plays the same role as Linus van Pelt. Lisa is modelled after Sally Brown and Bart looks like Charlie Brown; he even says \"good grief\", echoing Charlie Brown's catchphrase. The main theme to Peanuts \"Linus and Lucy\" is played several times. A redesigned version of Santa's Little Helper can be seen sleeping on top of his dog house and Homer is seen sleeping on top of his house in a manner similar to Snoopy. When Marge first speaks, she uses a muted trombone. This is a parody of the \"wah wah wah\" voice that is used for adults in the various Peanuts specials. At the end of the segment, she says to the audience that they can send complaints to an address which she only says in more muted trombone noises.
