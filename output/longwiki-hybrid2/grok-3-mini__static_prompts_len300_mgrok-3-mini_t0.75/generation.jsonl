Reflecting on his early years in the league, Javie told Sports Illustrated in October 2000, \"I'd get so mad I'd lose control for two or three minutes, and that's when I would miss calls.\" Javie developed mentorships with referees Joe Crawford and Jack Madden to assist in the maturation process. Working his debut game with Crawford at the Pontiac Silverdome in Detroit, Michigan, Javie received a grade of 40 points out of 100 by supervisor Darell Garretson. While reviewing game film later at the hotel, Crawford noted errors made throughout the game by himself. As a result of this film study, Javie learned that experienced officials make mistakes and admitting error will improve a referee's ability in the long-term. Ninety minutes after the conclusion of a game, Javie reviews game film. In addition to film review, Madden taught Javie not to lose focus when players and coaches were upset, and to walk away from them rather than becoming angry. Javie credited his mentors for success as a referee saying, \"My mentors have made me what I am today. I'm a little part of each of them. It's their success in teaching me.\" Javie had an on-court incident during the 1990\u201391 NBA season in a game between the Portland Trail Blazers and Washington Bullets. Bullets' forward Pervis Ellison threw the ball at referee Billy Spooner prompting Javie to run across the court to impose a technical foul on Ellison. In the sequence of events that followed, Javie ejected Ellison after protesting the call, the Bullets' head coach Wes Unseld for protesting the dismissal of Ellison, and the Bullets' mascot, \"Hoops\", for making gestures to incite the crowd. Rod Thorn, then the NBA's vice president for operations, ruled that Javie overreacted in ejecting Ellison and would be subject to discipline. The extent of the disciplinary action was not disclosed. Javie reflected on the experience saying, \"My fatal mistake was getting involved with Billy [Spooner] and Pervis [Ellison] in the first place. You have to be there for your partners, but most of the time you've got to let them call their game.\" Nearly three years later in another game involving the Portland Trail Blazers, Trail Blazers radio broadcast analyst Mike Rice was ejected by Javie for disputing calls from his broadcast position. During the 2002\u201303 NBA season, Javie was fined \\$1,000 by the league for a verbal altercation with Pat Riley, then-head coach of the Miami Heat. In April 2003, Javie was the referee in Michael Jordan's final game of his fifteen-year NBA career. During a game break towards the end of regulation, Javie congratulated Jordan on his career and told him he was a \"class act\". Javie then turned around and told the younger players on the court, \"You could do a lot worse than modeling yourselves after this guy.\" #### Income tax evasion trial\n\nIn January 1999, Javie was the only one of fifteen referees to be acquitted of tax evasion charges as a result of not reporting income he received by downgrading airline tickets provided by the league. Other referees were sentenced to probation or a period of house arrest, and ordered to pay the taxes. He fought the charges because he believed he did not intentionally do anything wrong. Discussing the trial, Javie told Referee magazine, \"My job is about my name. My dad taught me your name is the most important thing. I had to fight for my name.\" During the trial, Javie argued that he didn't owe taxes on more than \\$84,000 in income over three years because the money was value-earned from frequent flyer miles, which are non-taxable. He later described the trial as \"the hardest two weeks\" of his life.\n\n #### Retirement\n\nJavie announced his retirement before the beginning of the 2011\u201312 season.\n\nOn June 22, 2017, Javie was one of four new inductees into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame in Troy, Michigan. He was the recipient of Sports Faith International's Father Smyth Award on May 22, 2021.\n\nHe is a permanent deacon in the Catholic Church.\n\n ### Media career\n\nIn June 2012, it was announced that Javie would join NBA on ESPN, serving as a rules analyst working marquee games during the season and throughout the NBA Playoffs. Javie also appears on ESPN programming to discuss controversial referee occurrences.","h_score":1635285.4812500002,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":5111492,"revid":1162123304,"description":"American basketball referee (born 1955)","categories":["1955 births","American people of Polish descent","ESPN people","Living people","National Basketball Association referees","Sportspeople from Philadelphia","Temple University alumni"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Steve Javie?  \nA1: Steve Javie is a former professional basketball referee who officiated in the NBA for over 25 years.

There are six servants, and one mill of 10s. There are ten acres of meadow and thirty acres of pasture. In the time of the Confessor, it was worth 40 shillings when he received it four pounds, now 100 shillings. In the time of king Edward the Confessor, two men, Leuuin and Uluuin, held this land in coparcenary, and could turn themselves over with this land to whomever they would.\" Thus there were three manors within the parish; Ditton Manor, with the appendant Brampton Manor, and Sifletone, all of which were owned by the Bishop of Bayeux at this time. The Bishop of Bayeaux was Odo, Earl of Kent, half brother of William the Conqueror. In 1082, after it was discovered that Odo planned a military expedition to Italy, he was imprisoned, and his estates (including Ditton, Brampton, and Sifletone) were confiscated to the Crown. Following this, Ditton Manor appears to have been held by the Clares, earls of Gloucester, by a family who assumed their surname from Ditton. Likewise, Sifletone was confiscated and went to another family who took their surname from it. Ditton has a ford which, along with St Peter's Ad Vincula's Church, is situated in a conservation area on the west of a large green. The church is dated to the 12th century with a later 14th-century tower, and the first bell of Ditton church was hung there in 1656. Ditton parish register has as its opening words, \"The Register book of Ditton beginning Anno Dom. 1663. William Jole, rector, inducted Rector of Ditton, 1st August, Anno Dom. 1663. \" Also at the commencement, it is recorded, on 1 August 1711, that every acre of woodland in the parish of Ditton by immemorial custom pays tithe to the rector. In 1798 Ditton was recorded as being within the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Diocese of Rochester, and deanery of Malling. This parish, among others, was obliged to contribute to the repair of the fifth pier of Rochester bridge. The church was restored in 1860 by Sir George Gilbert Scott. The north nave window has fragments of fourteenth-century glass, and the nave has a good selection of hanging wall monuments and a benefactions board. A lead plaque on the nave wall, removed from the tower roof in 1859, has a picture of a ship from Nelson's time scratched on it. The mill that was recorded in the Domesday Book, Church Mill, was located close to the ford and closed down around 1912. In 1798 the parish was described in the following terms: \"The high road from London, through Wrotham, to Maidstone, crosses the middle of it, at the thirty-first milestone;","h_score":1585807.84375,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":6843140,"revid":1162207172,"description":null,"categories":["Civil parishes in Kent","Local Nature Reserves in Kent","Villages in Kent"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Ditton, Kent?  \nA1: Ditton is a village located in the county of Kent, England.

This technology, rooted in historical designs, is increasingly relevant today as climate change exacerbates global water challenges.\n\n#### What is an Air Well?\nAn air well is a structure designed to cool air and condense its humidity into liquid water, without relying on electricity or complex machinery. Originating from ancient civilizations, these systems typically feature towers or walls that facilitate the condensation process through temperature differences.\n\n#### How Does an Air Well Work?\nThe device operates by drawing in humid air, which is then cooled inside the structure, causing water vapor to condense on surfaces. For instance, in a basic setup, the air well uses the diurnal temperature cycle to trap and collect moisture, yielding usable water.\n\n#### Benefits and Applications\nAir wells are particularly useful in arid or coastal areas, providing an eco-friendly alternative to traditional water sources. \"This simple innovation could revolutionize water access in remote communities,\" said Dr. Elena Vasquez, a hydrologist at the University of Arizona. In contrast, environmental engineer Marcus Lee noted, \"With proper scaling, air wells reduce dependency on groundwater, promoting conservation efforts.\"\n\nAs water demands grow worldwide, air wells hold potential for broader integration into sustainable infrastructure."}

He said \"It was a dream to join the team I have supported all my life\". The Daily Mirror printed that \"Hughes has red hair, tattoos of a Tasmanian devil and a British bulldog on his forearms, dynamite in his boots and Albion in his blood.\" Fans affectionately nicknamed him the \"Ginger Ninja\".\n\nHe made his debut at The Hawthorns as a substitute in a 2\u20131 win over Tranmere Rovers on 9 August 1997. Seven days later he scored two goals from the bench in a 3\u20132 win over Crewe Alexandra at Gresty Road. Though signed by Ray Harford, he came to the fore under new boss Denis Smith. Smith handed Hughes his first start on 28 December, in a 1\u20131 home draw with Stoke City. He finished his debut season as the club's top-scorer with 14 goals in 41 appearances, and was rewarded with a new four-year contract.\n\nHe started the 1998\u201399 season in fine form, and claimed his first ever hat-trick in a 3\u20130 win over Port Vale at Vale Park on 22 August. Despite having recently signed a long-term contract, his form and goal record led to constant rumours of a big money move to a host of Premier League clubs. West Brom eventually issued a \"hands-off\" warning to other clubs. He claimed further hat-tricks against Crystal Palace and Huddersfield Town, and finished the season with 32 goals in 45 games. This tally left him as the country's top-scorer. He was named on the PFA Team of the Year for the First Division. He then submitted a written transfer request, and his spokesman told the press that there have \"been a number of things going on behind the scenes which have unsettled him recently\". In particular, his \u00a31,400 a week salary was compared with the \u00a35,000 a week salary of under-performing teammate Fabian de Freitas.\n\nHe remained at the club for the 1999\u20132000 season and scored 17 goals in 43 appearances. Albion struggled in the First Division under new manager Brian Little, though improved after Gary Megson replaced Little as manager in March and avoided relegation despite Hughes missing the final five matches of the season due to a knee injury.\n\nHe was partnered with Jason Roberts for the 2000\u201301 season; the pair went on to score 40 goals between them to help secure the \"Baggies\" a play-off place. With 23 goals to his name, he again attracted interest from other clubs. He claimed two hat-tricks in seven days against Gillingham and Preston North End. Hughes converted a penalty in a 2\u20132 draw with Bolton Wanderers in the first leg of the play-off semi-final, before a 3\u20130 defeat at the Reebok Stadium ended Albion's play-off hopes. He refused to sign a new contract in July 2001, and was placed on the transfer list.\n\n ### Coventry City\n\nHughes was sold to Gordon Strachan's Coventry City for a club record transfer fee of \u00a35,000,001 (the unusual figure was because any offer exceeding \u00a35 million would trigger an escape clause in his West Brom contract) in August 2001. His wages at Highfield Road were reported to be \u00a315,000 a week. Hughes scored 14 goals in 40 games, including a hat-trick in a 6\u20131 win at Crewe Alexandra, and finished the 2001\u201302 season as the club's top-scorer. Coventry rejected a loan offer from West Bromwich Albion in March 2002, and ended the season outside the play-offs.\n\n ### Return to West Bromwich Albion\n\nIn August 2002, Hughes returned to West Bromwich Albion for a club record \u00a32.5 million \u2013 half the fee Albion had received for him a year earlier \u2013 and signed a four-year deal with the club. Despite being a regular in the first team, Hughes failed to score a single Premier League goal in the 2002\u201303 season and Albion were relegated in 19th place with just six wins and 26 points from 38 matches. Hughes was criticised by several teammates following the club's 1\u20130 defeat by Everton at Goodison Park, though was publicly backed by manager Gary Megson.

The film reunites Taylor with Stephen Dorff, who both starred in the 1996 film I Shot Andy Warhol. - Chris Adamson as Doctor Lang Chris Adamson's renewed interest in the horror film genre stemmed from his viewing of 1931's Frankenstein. To prepare for his role in Leatherface, he watched The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and the 2003 remake, preferring the former: \"It seemed to have an innocence somehow compared to some of the chopped up limb movies which I have sometimes worked on.\" The character Doctor Lang is the director of the mental institution from which Jedidiah Sawyer and the other inmates escape; the Gorman House Youth Reformery. - Finn Jones as Deputy Sorells Hal Hartman's fellow law enforcement officer. - James Bloor as Ike - Jessica Madsen as Clarice Clarice is one of the escaped inmates and was originally intended to be an homage to Chop Top Sawyer, a character from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, but was later developed into her own character. Sherwood stated that the \"DNA\" of Chop Top is present in Clarice, describing him as his favourite Sawyer. A revisionist take on Chop Top was added due to the diminished role of the family in earlier drafts of the script, but was removed when the filmmakers began to feel that she was more of a \"rip-off\" than a genuine tribute. The version of Clarice that appears in the final film emerged when Sherwood imagined \"an image of this little girl in pigtails burning down her house with her parents inside\". Out of all the performances in Leatherface, Sherwood called Jessica Madsen's the most accurate of what he envisioned while writing. Deciding that Clarice is \"much more than just a pyromaniac\", Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo removed scenes detailing her backstory, such as her weaponising fire for the first time, her addiction for watching moving flames, and exposition on her family's disappearance. As the film begins, it remains ambiguous as to which inmate is actually Jedidiah Sawyer, the eventual Leatherface. Maury and Bustillo even considered leading the audience to believe that Clarice could become the titular character, \"It wasn\u2019t a so crazy idea to have regarding the passion Leatherface had for dresses and makeup in the previous movies.\" - Sam Coleman as Bud Sam Coleman portrays Bud, a hulking mental patient that escapes the institution with Jackson, Clarice, and Ike. Additionally, Julian Kostov portrays Ted Hardesty in the film, the father of Sally and Franklin Hardesty, the final girl and her brother from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Although his role is brief, there was going to be an additional scene exploring his family that was removed for budgetary reasons. Nubbins Sawyer, the older brother of Leatherface known simply as \"The Hitchhiker\" in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, is played by Dejan Angelov. Lorina Kamburova fills the role of Hal Hartman's daughter, whose death sets the plot into motion, while Boris Kabakchief plays Jedidiah Sawyer in his child years. Other acting credits include Dimo Alexiev, Nathan Cooper, and Nicole Andrews. ## Production\n\n","h_score":1597651.7937500002,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":46860810,"revid":1171638602,"description":"2017 American horror film directed by Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo","categories":["2010s American films","2010s English-language films","2017 films","2017 horror films","American horror films","American prequel films","Films about cannibalism","Films directed by Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo","Films scored by John Frizzell (composer)","Films set in 1955","Films set in 1965","Films set in Texas","Films set in psychiatric hospitals","Films shot in Bulgaria","GA-Class film articles","Lionsgate films","Necrophilia in film","The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise) films"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Leatherface (2017): A Prequel to the Texas Chainsaw Horror Legacy\n\nThe 2017 film \"Leatherface\" serves as a prequel to the iconic Texas Chain Saw Massacre series, exploring the origins of the infamous killer in a gritty, psychological thriller set in the 1950s.

Members took sides in the dispute, which led to synagogue disturbances, a contested election, and eventually to Ash's taking Rothstein to a United States court to try to oust him as president of the congregation. After the court rejected Ash's arguments, a large majority of members left with Ash to form Beth Hamedrash Hagodol (\"Great House of Study\"), adding the word \"Hagodol\" (\"Great\") to the original name. The followers of Rothstein stayed at the Allen Street location and retained the name \"Beth Hamedrash\" until the mid-1880s. With membership and financial resources both severely reduced, they were forced to merge with Congregation Holche Josher Wizaner; the combined congregation adopted the name \"Kahal Adath Jeshurun\", and built the Eldridge Street Synagogue. According to Eisenstein, Beth Hamedrash Hagodol provided an atmosphere that was \"socially religious\", in which Jews \"combine[d] piety with pleasure; they call[ed] their shule a shtibl or prayer-club room; they desire[d] to be on familiar terms with the Almighty and abhor[red] decorum; they want[ed] everyone present to join and chant the prayers; above all they scorn[ed] a regularly ordained cantor.\" In contrast to the informality of the services, members scrupulously observed the Jewish dietary laws, and every member personally oversaw the baking of his matzos for use on Passover. The congregation initially moved to the top floor of a building at the corner of Grand and Forsyth Streets, and in 1865 moved again, to a former courthouse on Clinton Street. In 1872, the congregation built a synagogue at Ludlow and Hester Streets. There the congregation's younger members gained greater control and introduced some minor innovations; for example, changing the title of parnas to president, and in 1877 hiring a professional cantor\u2014Judah Oberman\u2014for \\$500 (today \\$) per year, to bring greater formality and decorum to the services as well as to attract new members. While somewhat \"Americanized\", in general the congregation remained quite traditional. Men and women sat separately, the full service in the traditional prayer book was followed, and the congregation still trained men for rabbinic ordination. Additionally, Talmud and Mishna study groups, founded in the 1870s, were held both mornings and evenings. Ash had only served as Beth Hamedrash Hagodol's rabbi intermittently during this time; during the American Civil War he had briefly been a successful manufacturer of hoopskirts, before losing his money, and returning to the rabbinate. Congregants had a number of issues with him, including his outside business ventures and an alleged inclination towards Hasidism. The more learned members of the congregation contested his scholarship. Ash resigned as rabbi in 1877, and in 1879, directors of Beth Hamedrash Hagodol proposed that a Chief Rabbi be hired for New York. A number of New York City synagogues formed the \"United Hebrew Orthodox Congregations\", and agreed to select the Malbim (Me\u00efr Leibush ben Jehiel Michel Weiser) for the role. The appointment was announced in Philadelphia's Jewish Record, but the Malbim never filled the position. Beth Hamedrash Hagodol re-hired Ash to fill the vacant role of congregational rabbi at a salary of \\$25 per month (or \\$300\u2014today \\$\u2014per year). The following year the congregation hired a new cantor, Simhe Samuelson, for \\$1,000 (today \\$) a year, over three times Ash's salary.","h_score":1615624.6187500001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":10212125,"revid":1127278856,"description":"Synagogue in Manhattan, New York City","categories":["1852 establishments in New York (state)","Buildings and structures demolished in 2019","Churches completed in 1850","Demolished buildings and structures in Manhattan","Former New York City Designated Landmarks","Former churches in New York City","Former synagogues in New York (state)","Gothic Revival architecture in New York City","Gothic Revival synagogues","Lower East Side","New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan","Orthodox synagogues in New York City","Properties of religious function on the National Register of Historic Places in Manhattan","Religious organizations established in 1852","Russian-Jewish culture in New York City","Synagogues completed in 1885","Synagogues in Manhattan","Synagogues on the National Register of Historic Places in New York City","Ukrainian-Jewish culture in New York City"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Historic Synagogue Beth Hamedrash Hagodol Faces Uncertain Future\n\nBeth Hamedrash Hagodol, located on New York's Lower East Side, was a prominent Orthodox Jewish synagogue established in the 19th century and served as a cultural and religious hub for immigrants. Despite its destruction by fire in 2017, the site remains a symbol of Jewish heritage in America, with ongoing discussions about preservation.\n\n#### Early History\nFounded in 1850 as a small prayer house, Beth Hamedrash Hagodol grew into one of the oldest synagogues in the United States, attracting Eastern European Jewish immigrants. It underwent expansions in the late 1800s, featuring traditional architecture that reflected the era's immigrant communities. By the early 20th century, it had become a key institution for religious services and community events.\n\n#### Architectural and Cultural Significance\nThe building was designated a New York City landmark in 1967 due to its ornate design and historical role in Jewish life. It housed important artifacts and hosted notable figures, making it a vital part of the city's cultural fabric. \"Beth Hamedrash Hagodol was a cornerstone of the Lower East Side, preserving traditions for generations,\" said historian Samuel Gruber.\n\n#### Recent Developments\nA fire in 2017 severely damaged the structure, leading to its collapse and raising concerns about urban preservation efforts. Community groups have since advocated for restoration, though funding and regulatory challenges persist. \"We must protect these sites to honor our shared history,\" noted preservationist Andrew Dolkart.\n\nLooking ahead, efforts to secure funding for potential rebuilding could help ensure Beth Hamedrash Hagodol's legacy endures for future generations."}

Umpired by former Cambridge rower James Crowden, Oxford won in a time of 18 minutes and 58 seconds. The race was complicated by bad weather, and when faced with choppy water, a strong headwind and horizontal, driving rain, the Cambridge boat, which lacked splashboards, took on water and sank. It was the fifth time a boat had sunk during the event.\n\nIn the reserve race, Cambridge's Goldie beat Oxford's Isis by 1+1\u20444 lengths. Cambridge won the 33rd Women's Boat Race.\n\n ## Background\n\nThe Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing competition between the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. First held in 1829, the competition is a 4.2-mile (6.8 km) race along the River Thames in southwest London. The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and is followed throughout the United Kingdom and worldwide. Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having won the 1977 race by seven lengths, with Cambridge leading overall with 68 victories to Oxford's 54 (excluding the \"dead heat\" of 1877). The 1978 race was sponsored by Ladbrokes, while the BBC had paid between \u00a310,000 and \u00a320,000 to televise the event.\n\nDuring training for the race, Oxford had sunk, taking on water in the inclement weather, and had decided to fit splashboards to their boat, while Cambridge opted to leave their boat unchanged. Prior to this year's event, there had been four sinkings in the history of the race. Cambridge sank in 1859, Oxford sank in 1925 and 1951, and both crews sank in 1912.\n\nThe first Women's Boat Race took place in 1927, but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s. Up until 2014, the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races, but as of the 2015 race, it is held on the River Thames, on the same day as the men's main and reserve races. The reserve race, contested between Oxford's Isis boat and Cambridge's Goldie boat has been held since 1965. It usually takes place on the Tideway, prior to the main Boat Race.\n\n ## Crews\n\nOxford's crew contained three Old Blues in Moran, Shealy and the former lightweight world champion Andy Michelmore, while Cambridge's boat featured five returning rowers in Bathurst, Clegg, Horton, Ross and Cooke-Yarborough. The race also marked the debut of Boris Rankov, who went on to represent Oxford in five further races. The Cambridge crew was marginally heavier per rower, averaging 1.5 pounds (0.68 kg) more than Oxford.\n\n ## Race description\n\nOxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station. After a false start, the race commenced at 2.45 p.m. in reasonable weather conditions, and Oxford took a one-length lead to Hammersmith Bridge in a record time of 6 minutes 24 seconds. As the crews turned into the Surrey bend, conditions drastically worsened with a strong headwind and \"horizontal rain driving into them\". Entering choppy water and in an attempt to push past Oxford, Cambridge made their challenge at Barnes Bridge but began to take on water. Within seconds the boat started to sink; the Oxford crew realised the contest was over and rowed carefully to the finish in a time of 18 minutes 58 seconds. It was Oxford's third victory in a row, and their fourth in the past five years.\n\nIn the reserve race, Cambridge's Goldie beat Oxford's Isis by 1+1\u20444 lengths, and in the 33rd running of the Women's Boat Race, Cambridge also triumphed.\n\n ## Reaction\n\nCambridge boat club president Mark Horton immediately challenged the Oxford president Andy Michelmore to a re-row; the challenge was declined. Horton recalls \"It was hard to take and is still a painful memory. The Boat Race was supposed to be one of the proudest moments of my life\". Cambridge's Mark Bathurst was indignant about the preparation of the boat: \"we had taken to the water without fitting any [splashboards] \u2013 an act of monumental idiocy\". Oxford cox Fail told The Guardian \"I was surprised when I heard that Cambridge had sunk. If you keep going steadily you forget about water and ride it out.\"\n\nCambridge's sinking was featured as the 79th in Channel 4's 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.","h_score":1587235.01875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":42555959,"revid":1148423337,"description":null,"categories":["1978 in English sport","1978 in rowing","1978 sports events in London","March 1978 sports events in the United Kingdom","The Boat Race"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is The Boat Race?  \nA1: The Boat Race is an annual rowing competition between the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, held on the River Thames in London.

On November 18, 2004, NASA announced that Nowak and her classmate Stephanie Wilson would join the STS-121 crew as additional mission specialists. They were assigned the task of manipulating the robotic arms of the Space Shuttle and the ISS. The STS-121 mission was originally scheduled for March or April 2005, but was soon postponed to July owing to difficulty implementing all the changes required. During the launch of for STS-114 in July 2005, debris separated from the external tank, the very problem which had caused the loss of the , and STS-121 was further postponed until a solution to the problem could be found. In February 2006, the mission was rescheduled for a launch window between May 3 and 22, but in March multiple problems forced a further postponement until July. A prelaunch reception was held for Nowak at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, and she was joined by her parents, her husband Richard and three children, family members, and friends from school, Annapolis and the Navy. Among the personal effects she packed for the flight was a small owl figurine of the mascot of Luxmanor Elementary School, a koozie from Tilden Middle School, a banner from Charles W. Woodward High School, an Annapolis Class of 1985 flag, and her grandmother's engagement ring. On July 1, 2006, the STS-121 crew ate the traditional prelaunch cake decorated with the mission's insignia and boarded Discovery at Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39B. Nowak was the last crew member to enter the spacecraft, taking her seat as the flight engineer on the flight deck immediately behind Lindsey and Kelly. At 15:42, the launch was scrubbed due to thunderstorm activity in the area. A second launch attempt the following day was also canceled due to inclement weather. STS-121 successfully launched on July 4 at 14:38. It was the first time a Space Shuttle launch had taken place on Independence Day. After she entered orbit, Nowak felt nauseated, a symptom of space adaptation syndrome. The first day in space was devoted to inspecting the orbiter for possible damage, as the crew had noticed debris falling off the external tank during liftoff. Nowak deployed the robotic arm to inspect the wing tips, nose and underside of the spacecraft using digital and video cameras and laser scanning. After six and a half hours of examination, all that was found was a white splotch on the nose cap. NASA engineers were initially concerned that this might be the result of a high-velocity impact, but after closer examination they determined it to be bird droppings. Some discoloration found on the leading edges was attributed to hydraulic fluid spills. After Discovery docked with the ISS, Wilson and Nowak used the robotic arm to unload the Italian-built Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM). The 3,400 kilograms (7,400 lb) of equipment and supplies it contained included the Minus Eighty Lab Freezer for use in scientific experiments and a 640-kilogram (1,400 lb) Oxygen Generation System to allow the ISS to support up to six crew members. Nowak carried out her assigned tasks, but other crew members noted a reluctance to assist with tasks that were not assigned to her and for which she had not trained. While Discovery was docked with the ISS, the STS-121 crew conducted three spacewalks. The women were not considered for this activity; when NASA trimmed the space suit budget in the 1990s, small sizes were omitted. Women astronauts were assigned to other tasks like operating the robotic arms. From the Destiny laboratory on the ISS, Nowak operated the robotic arm whose installation she had overseen as CAPCOM years before. It was more challenging to operate than the one on the Space Shuttle, since it was larger and had an extra joint. Some 2,000 kilograms (4,300 lb) of trash, experiment results and broken equipment were packed into Leonardo, and Nowak and Wilson used the robotic arm to re-stow the module in Discovery's cargo bay. It was then used to make a final check of the Space Shuttle to ensure that no damage had been done by micrometeorites or space debris. Discovery undocked from the ISS and commenced its two-day return to Earth. In all, she spent 12 days 18 hours and 36 minutes in space, during which she traveled 8 million kilometers (5 million miles). Discovery landed at the Shuttle Landing Facility at the Kennedy Space Center at 09:14 on July 17. ### Homecoming\n\nAs was usual, the six crew members of STS-121 embarked on a series of publicity events and interviews. They attended X Games XII at the Home Depot Center in Los Angeles from August 3 to 6, and the Houston Astros game on August 14 at Minute Maid Park, where the crew met pitcher Roger Clemens and threw ceremonial first pitches. On September 9, Nowak attended a tailgate party at the Naval Academy versus University of Massachusetts football game, where she gave her classmates the Class of 1985 flag she had carried on the Space Shuttle and signed photographs of herself. At half time she presented Annapolis with a Navy jersey she had carried on board Discovery. She gave a long interview with the Ladies' Home Journal for its Mother's Day issue and presented awards at NASA's Stennis Space Center. She went back to Luxmanor Elementary School and Tilden Middle School where she spoke to the children and attended celebrations at Annapolis for the 30th anniversary of its admission of women, during which she gave a presentation as part of the academy's Forrestal Lecture Series. In December, the STS-121 crew flew to the UK, where they visited the University of Edinburgh and the National Space Centre in Leicester, and spoke at the University of Leeds, fellow STS-121 crewmember Piers Sellers's alma mater.\n\n ## Orlando International Airport incident\n\nNowak's marriage disintegrated, and she separated from Richard in January 2007. Her relationship with Oefelein also cooled, although she continued to call him almost every day. In late 2006, Oefelein began a relationship with U.S. Air Force Captain Colleen Shipman, who worked as an engineer with the 45th Space Wing at Patrick Air Force Base in Florida. Oefelein informed Nowak about Shipman in January. He thought Nowak took it well, and that they could remain friends. They continued to train for the MS 150, a charity bicycle race, but Shipman became uncomfortable with Nowak's bicycle being kept at Oefelein's place and asked him to get Nowak to remove it.\n\nOn January 29, 2007, NASA announced that Stephanie Wilson had been chosen as the mission specialist for the STS-120 mission to replace Michael Foreman, who had been reassigned to the STS-123 mission, scheduled for February. Nowak had hoped for this assignment. According to Mark Kelly, Wilson was chosen because \"she was a team player and well deserving. Nowak was not.\" Nowak was assigned to CAPCOM duties for STS-123 instead.\n\n","h_score":1612105.8500000001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":2313053,"revid":1173515465,"description":"American NASA astronaut (b. 1963)","categories":["1963 births","20th-century American women","21st-century American women","American people convicted of assault","American people convicted of burglary","American people of Italian descent","American women engineers","Female United States Navy officers","Living people","Military personnel from Washington, D.C.","Naval Postgraduate School alumni","People from Rockville, Maryland","People with Asperger syndrome","People with mood disorders","People with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder","Space Shuttle program astronauts","United States Naval Academy alumni","United States Naval Flight Officers","United States Naval Test Pilot School alumni","United States Navy astronauts","United States Navy captains","Women astronauts"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Lisa Nowak?  \nA1: Lisa Nowak is a former NASA astronaut born in 1963, known for her pioneering space missions and a dramatic fall from grace.

This phenomenon, driven by brain chemistry and environmental cues, challenges our willpower and contributes to rising health issues like obesity, yet it also highlights the joy in everyday treats.\n\n**Unmasking the Pleasure Beast**  \nHedonic hunger isn't your stomach growling\u2014it's your mind's wild craving for that decadent chocolate or crispy fries, even when you're full. Picture your brain as a playful trickster, lighting up reward centers like a fireworks show at the mere thought of flavor explosions, turning meals into emotional escapades rather than mere sustenance.\n\n**The Neural Tug-of-War**  \nDeep in the brain's circuits, hedonic hunger flips switches in the dopamine pathways, making us chase highs from high-calorie foods. \"It's like an internal party crasher,\" explains Dr. Emily Thompson, a neuroscientist at Harvard, \"where pleasure overrides logic, hijacking our decisions one bite at a time.\" This unexpected angle reveals how modern life's barrage of ads and ultra-processed temptations amplifies these urges, turning casual snacking into a full-blown obsession.\n\n**Strategies for Reining in the Feast**  \nTo combat this, experts suggest mindfulness techniques, like pausing before plating that second helping, or swapping treats for healthier alternatives that still spark joy. As nutritionist Alex Rivera notes, \"Hedonic hunger can be a creative force if channeled wisely, transforming cravings into opportunities for balanced indulgence.\" By building awareness and environment tweaks, we can enjoy life's flavors without falling into excess.\n\nLooking ahead, emerging tech like AI-driven apps could soon personalize interventions, helping us outsmart hedonic hunger before it derails our diets."}

The youngest daughter of the family, the Ka Khadduh, inherits all ancestral property. After marriage, husbands live in the mother-in-law's home. The mother's surname is taken by children. When no daughters are born to a couple, they adopt a daughter and pass their rights to property to her. The birth of a girl is celebrated while the birth of a son is simply accepted. There is no social stigma attributed to a woman remarrying or giving birth out of wedlock as the \"Khasi Social Custom Lineage Act\" gives security to them. Women are known to intermarry outside their tribe. The women who enjoy all the rights live an independent life, dress well, attend church, and many prefer not to get married. They enjoy total security, unlike in the rest of the country. A successful career women of the Khasi society feels that \"their societal anomaly\" has enabled her to be successful in every way. Most small businesses are managed by women. In 1994, Bina Agarwal compared characteristic features between the Garo and Khasi. She reported that Garo practiced matrilineal inheritance, matrilocal post-marital residence, a preference for cross-cousin marriage, acceptance of pre-marital sex by women, but adultery by women is punished, while the Khasi practised matrilineal inheritance, matrilocal and duolocal post-marital residence (in which the husband lives in a separate house while the wife stays at her parents\u2019 residence), an aversion to cross-cousin marriage, and again, acceptance of pre-marital sex by women, but adultery by women is punished. Care of children is the responsibility of mothers or mothers-in-law. The youngest daughter of this society who inherits the ancestral property holds a pivotal role of looking after the welfare of her parents in their old age, as well as the welfare and education of her siblings. Some Khasi men perceive themselves to be accorded a secondary status. They have established societies such as the Syngkhong Rympei Thymmai (SRT) (3,000 members) and Sam Kam Rin Ku Mai (Societal Restructuring Association) to protect equal rights for men. They express that \"Khasi men don\u2019t have any security, they don\u2019t own land, they don\u2019t run the family business and, at the same time, they are almost good for nothing.\" However, Patricia Mukhim, who edits the Shillong Times feels: \"I tend to think Khasi men feel diminished in their manhood compared with outsiders... it's a pity, because that's what distinguishes us from the others\". While the society is matrilineal, it is not matriarchal. In past monarchies of the state, the son of the youngest sister of the king inherited the throne. Even now in the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly or village councils or panchayats the representation of women in politics is minimal. As of 2013, in a Meghalaya Legislative Assembly of 60 members, there are only four women. In the male-centric Dorbar Shnong, which is the basic political arm of the tribes, women are not permitted to hold office. However, women feel that they take better care of money matters than men and they enjoy economic freedom.","h_score":1588631.96875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":49710750,"revid":1064873121,"description":"Migration flow in Meghalaya","categories":["Khasi people","Matriarchy","People from Meghalaya","Tribes of Meghalaya","Women's rights in India"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Meghalaya's Matrilineal Society: A Cultural Legacy\n\nIn Meghalaya, India, tribes like the Khasi, Garo, and Jaintia practice matriliny, where lineage, inheritance, and family names are passed through the mother's line, giving women significant social and economic roles. This system contrasts with patrilineal norms elsewhere, emphasizing gender equality in daily life and decision-making.\n\n**What is Matrilineal Society?**  \nA matrilineal society traces descent from the female line, meaning children belong to their mother's clan and property often passes to daughters. This structure empowers women in areas such as household leadership and resource management, as seen in many indigenous cultures worldwide. Unlike patrilineal systems, it does not imply female dominance but rather a balanced approach to gender roles.\n\n**How It Functions in Meghalaya?**  \nIn Meghalaya, matriliny shapes everyday practices, with women inheriting family property and holding key positions in community affairs. For instance, \"In our Khasi community, the youngest daughter inherits the family home, ensuring stability for future generations,\" explains Pynshailang Syiem, a Khasi elder. This system fosters strong maternal bonds and community support, though men often manage external affairs.\n\n**Cultural Significance and Challenges?**  \nMatrilineal traditions in Meghalaya promote women's education and autonomy, contributing to higher female literacy rates in the region. However, modernization and globalization pose threats, as external influences sometimes erode these customs. As noted by anthropologist Dr. Rita Kumar, \"Urban migration is challenging traditional matriliny, but it remains a vital part of our identity.\" Despite these pressures, the practice continues to symbolize resilience and equality.\n\nLooking ahead, experts suggest that Meghalaya's matrilineal system could inspire global discussions on gender equity as societies adapt to changing demographics."}

(video game)","reference":"## Plot P. T. centers on an unnamed protagonist who awakens in a concrete-lined room and opens a door to a haunted corridor, in which the player can only walk through a hallway which continuously loops and redecorates itself. The first time the player passes, a radio reports on a familicide, which was committed by the father, and later mentions two other cases exactly like it. Later on, the protagonist encounters a hostile and unstable female apparition, presumably named \"Lisa\". Upon entering the bathroom and being locked inside, he obtains a flashlight and discovers a fetus-like creature crying in the sink. The protagonist exits, he soon realizes that he is being watched and stalked by \"Lisa\". While it is possible to avoid the ghost completely, the protagonist will die when he is attacked by the ghost. After his death he returns to the first room of the game, and the loop starts all over again. In the first room the player will discover a moving bloody paper bag which \"tells\" him of a disturbing experience, stating the same quote seen at the start of the game: \"Watch out. The gap in the door... it's a separate reality. The only me is me. Are you sure the only you is you?\" The next few loops feature a refrigerator hanging from the ceiling leaking blood. The muffled sound of a crying baby can be heard from the violently shaking refrigerator. After the player completes a puzzle and enters the next loop, the refrigerator is absent and the radio issues a Swedish message referencing the 1938 radio drama The War of the Worlds. In the next loop, the lamps turn completely red, the player's vision blurs, the protagonist moves abnormally quickly, and the corridor stretches out into infinity. The protagonist discovers a hole in the wall and looks through it to hear a woman being stabbed to death in the bathroom, while a voice on the radio rants about societal instability. After the sounds stop, the bathroom door opens by itself and the player enters upon the fetus-like creature telling the protagonist that ten months earlier, an unspecified man lost his job, and turned to alcoholism. His wife worked as a part-time cashier to financially support the family, but the manager was sexually attracted to her. The corridor then corrects itself and the protagonist eventually hears a voice uttering \"204863\" repeatedly. The player's perspective distorts, and the game displays a fake crash message. When the game is restarted, the protagonist awakens in the concrete-lined room and continues the next and final loop with only the flashlight as a light source. The protagonist discovers the torn pieces of a photograph scattered throughout the hall and reassembles it in its frame. After the picture is completed, and a set of tasks is done, a telephone rings; the protagonist answers the phone to hear the words \"You've been chosen.\" The protagonist hears a door unlock and leaves the building. In the subsequent cutscene, a voice remarks about having lived a life of regularity until his father killed him and his family without any creativity; he states his intention to return with his \"new toys\". The protagonist steps out into the streets of a deserted town and is revealed to be portrayed by Norman Reedus. The credits reveal the nature of the playable teaser.","h_score":1632272.9875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":46557114,"revid":1171433174,"description":"2014 video game","categories":["2010s horror video games","2014 video games","Delisted digital-only games","Fiction about familicide","Fox Engine games","Konami games","Mass murder in fiction","PlayStation 4 games","PlayStation 4-only games","Psychological horror games","Silent Hill games","Single-player video games","Video game controversies","Video game marketing","Video games about ghosts","Video games about suicide","Video games developed in Japan","Video games directed by Hideo Kojima"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Ghostly Grip of P.T.: A Teaser That Terrorized the Gaming World\n\nIn a stroke of shadowy genius, P.T.\u2014short for Playable Teaser\u2014emerged in 2014 as a cryptic demo for the canceled Silent Hills, blending psychological horror with innovative gameplay that left players breathless and the industry shaken.

He asked to meet Black in his studio in November 2009, which led to them writing her debut single \"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\" the next day. RedOne helped Black break away from her contract with Virgin Records and signed her to his Universal Republic imprint, 2101 Records. He introduced her to a new manager, Derrick \"EI\" Lawrence, who also managed Lil Wayne. Wayne invited her to join him on his I Am Music Tour after meeting her. She changed her name to Porcelain Black, as it caused confusion to people who thought Porcelain and the Tramps was a band. Her stage name came from her childhood nickname, Porcelain, which was due to an extensive collection of porcelain dolls given to her by her aunt. Her aunt thought that the dolls resembled her in appearance, with strawberry blond hair and pale skin. She included \"Black\" in her name because she felt that it represented the opposite of \"fragile\" porcelain. She made plans to revisit the Porcelain and the Tramps project in the future. The songs \"King of the World\" and \"I'm Your Favorite Drug\" were remastered for her debut album. Black co-wrote \"Lolita\" for Mexican pop singer Belinda. She made appearances in the music videos for Travie McCoy's \"We'll Be Alright\", Swizz Beatz's \"Rock 'N' Roll\" and Jeffree Star's \"Get Away With Murder\" in 2010. Black had a cameo role in Rock of Ages with RedOne's help, playing the lead singer of a 1980s glam metal band. She sang one of the sole original songs for the film, \"Rock Angels\". The song was written by Adam Anders and Desmond Child. Along with RedOne, Black composed \"Save You Tonight\", the closing song for One Direction's debut album, Up All Night. Black appeared on Oxygen's Best Ink, where the working title of her debut album was said to be Mannequin Factory. Challengers on the show were tasked with creating cover art for the album in a style that Porcelain Black termed \"stripper couture\". The album has experienced numerous setbacks and rescheduled releases, and has not yet been released. Initially, RedOne was said to have produced and co-written all but one of the tracks with her. However, Black later recorded songs with other producers after the album's release date was pushed back. She made her television debut on the Late Show with David Letterman on July 21, 2011. After \"This is What Rock and Roll Looks Like\", \"Naughty Naughty\", the second single from her album, was released at the end of 2011. \"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\" was a modest hit on Billboard's Dance Club chart while the second single peaked at number 6 on the chart.

The rehearsal required that she practice the hurricanrana that would be used in the episode, however, the stunt double Dumas was working with dropped her as she swung through the move, causing her to land on her neck and shoulders. After she underwent a CAT scan, it was revealed that she had suffered three cracks in her vertebrae, necessitating surgery. On April 30, Dumas underwent neck surgery under Dr. Lloyd Youngblood, during which he used a section of her hip to fuse her C5 and C6 vertebrae together. She spent the subsequent year rehabilitating, making appearances on Sunday Night Heat as a color commentator, beginning in October 2002. During her time recovering, Matt and Jeff split thus ending Team Xtreme; Jeff would leave the WWE the following year and Matt would move to SmackDown!. On the April 21, 2003, episode of Raw, as part of a new storyline, she was fired from her position on commentary by general manager Eric Bischoff after she rejected his advances and his request that she follow in the footsteps of SmackDown!s Torrie Wilson and pose for Playboy. She returned to the ring after an absence of seventeen months on the September 15 episode of Raw, saving Trish Stratus from a beating at the hands of Molly Holly and Gail Kim. Co-general manager Stone Cold Steve Austin later explained to Eric Bischoff that he had rehired Lita. Lita and Stratus went on to defeat Holly and Kim in a tag team match on September 21 at Unforgiven. Lita feuded with Holly into late 2003, unsuccessfully challenging her for the Women's Championship on November 16 at Survivor Series. On the November 17 episode of Raw, Lita and Matt Hardy were reunited after Hardy was moved from SmackDown! to Raw. Continuing the storyline, Holly interrupted as Hardy was about to propose to Lita, challenging the duo to face her and Bischoff in an intergender tag team match later that evening. Bischoff later added the stipulation that Lita would earn a title shot if she won but would be fired if she lost. Hardy and Lita lost the match after Hardy refused to tag in, with Hardy berating Lita for \"selfishly\" returning to Raw instead of SmackDown!, claiming that this showed that she cared more about the Women's Championship than about him. Lita was rehired later that evening when Christian informed her that he had used his Survivor Series favor to get Bischoff to reinstate her. One week later, Lita lost to Victoria in the first ever women's steel cage match in WWE history, due to interference from Hardy. As Lita and Christian appeared to be developing an on-screen relationship, so did Stratus and Chris Jericho. Subsequently, Stratus and Lita participated in an intergender tag team match as partners on the December 1 episode of Raw. After the match, Stratus overheard Jericho talking to then-heel, Christian, about who could sleep with their respective woman first.

A review chaired by Jim Murphy and Sarah Boyack into the party's structure in Scotland subsequently concluded that the next leader should lead the entire Scottish Labour Party rather than just its MSPs, as previous leaders had. Lamont declared her candidacy for the leadership election in September 2011 and launched her campaign on 7 November at Stirling University. She told delegates that Labour needed to reengage with the electorate if it wanted to govern again: \"We must listen and learn, show humility and seek again to talk for and to people's ambitions and concerns. Our real challenge is that we in Labour lost our way, lost our confidence and lost Scotland.\"\n\nLamont's opponents in the leadership race were the MP Tom Harris, and her fellow MSP Ken Macintosh, both of whom had also expressed a need for Labour to change if it was to win the next election. Harris's campaign centred on the belief that Labour had to \"[re-establish] itself as the party of aspiration\", or it would risk becoming \"an irrelevance\". Macintosh felt the party had focused too heavily on its traditional support in the Central Belt while paying less attention to rural communities. He suggested increasing government help to tackle unemployment among young people, and wanted to nationalise rail and bus services.\n\nThe result of the election was announced on 17 December 2011 and saw Lamont secure an overall majority with 51.77% of the vote in the first round. Her closest rival was Macintosh with 40.28%, while Harris was third with 7.95%. Lamont also won majorities in two groups of Labour's three-tier electoral college system, securing the support of parliamentarians and affiliated bodies such as trade unions. Macintosh was backed by the majority of individual party members. In her acceptance speech, Lamont told party activists, \"Together we will change the Scottish Labour Party and win the chance to serve the people of Scotland again and make Scotland all that we know it can be.\" On the same day, MP Anas Sarwar was elected to the position of Deputy that Lamont had vacated.\n\n ### Shadow Cabinet\n\nLamont began appointing members of her shadow cabinet on 19 December 2011. Those given positions on her initial frontbench team include Macintosh (Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth), Hugh Henry (Labour spokesman for Education and Lifelong Learning), Lewis Macdonald (Shadow Justice Minister) and Boyack (Local Government and Planning). The post of Shadow Health Minister was given to Jackie Baillie, who had held the position previously. Gray was not included, as he had expressed a wish to take a break from frontline politics.\n\nLamont announced a major shakeup of the Labour frontbench team on 28 June 2013. Gray returned to replace Macintosh as the party's finance spokesman. Macdonald was appointed chief whip, and his previous role as Shadow Justice Minister was given to Graeme Pearson. Baillie was moved from Health to Social Justice and Welfare. Boyack kept her role in Local Government and Planning. Speaking about the reshuffle, Lamont said, \"We have made a great deal of progress in the last 18 months but we have to keep moving forward.\"\n\n","h_score":1680838.15625,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":1365578,"revid":1170307415,"description":"Scottish Labour politician","categories":["1957 births","20th-century Scottish women politicians","Alumni of the University of Glasgow","Alumni of the University of Strathclyde","Female members of the Scottish Parliament","Labour Co-operative MSPs","Leaders of Scottish Labour","Living people","Members of the Scottish Parliament 1999\u20132003","Members of the Scottish Parliament 2003\u20132007","Members of the Scottish Parliament 2007\u20132011","Members of the Scottish Parliament 2011\u20132016","Members of the Scottish Parliament 2016\u20132021","Members of the Scottish Parliament for Glasgow constituencies","People from Anderston","Scottish schoolteachers"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Johann Lamont?  \nA1: Johann Lamont is a prominent Scottish politician, best known for her leadership in the Scottish Labour Party.

The case Hinds et al. v. the Queen was an early test case for the new court. Four men, Moses Hinds, Henry Martin, Elkanah Hutchinson, and Samuel Thomas, had been arrested and convicted by the Gun Court in 1974 for possession of firearms and ammunition without a licence. They appealed their sentences to Jamaica's highest appellate court, the Court of Appeals, which initially declined to hear the case. However, they were allowed to apply to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, which agreed to review the legality of the Gun Court system. The Constitution of Jamaica reserves certain serious crimes to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and its divisions. The Gun Court Act had established the Full Court division, with resident magistrates presiding, to try major firearms offences. The Privy Council held that this provision of the act improperly encroached on the jurisdiction reserved for the Supreme Court, and that the Full Court division was therefore unconstitutional. This fault was remedied in 1976 by replacing the Full Court division with a new High Court division, presided over by a single Supreme Court justice. The Privy Council also found that the institution of an appointed review board to determine the length of sentences was contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers fundamental to the Westminster system of government. According to this principle, sentencing in each particular case is a function of the judiciary, and cannot be assigned to any other body. The 1976 amendment eliminated the review board entirely, leaving life imprisonment without review as the only possible sentence. Another case, Trevor Stone v. the Queen, challenged the denial of jury trial for most gun offences. It was argued that trial by jury is a fundamental and constitutional right guaranteed by tradition in English common law. The Jamaican Court of Appeals rejected this argument in a decision written by Court President Ira DeCordova Rowe in 1980. The court noted that the written Constitution adopted by Jamaica upon independence guaranteed certain rights to criminal defendants, but omitted trial by jury. This case confirmed the Gun Court's power to try all non-capital cases before judges alone. The case of Herbert Bell v. Director of Public Prosecutions, concerning the right to a speedy trial, reached the Privy Council in 1983. The defendant had been held awaiting trial for several years, but the state ultimately failed to present any evidence or witnesses. When he was again arrested on the same firearms charges, he filed suit arguing that the Gun Court had violated his constitutional rights through unreasonable delay. The Privy Council agreed, ruling that even when prevailing local standards were taken into account, Bell's trial had been excessively delayed through no fault of his own. The Gun Court Amendment Act of 1983 allowed Resident Magistrates to grant pre-trial bail, and to decide whether to keep firearms cases in the Resident Magistrate's Court or to send them to the High Court division of the Gun Court. Judges were given the power to set sentences other than life imprisonment. Cases involving defendants under 14 years old were directed to juvenile courts, instead of being heard by the ordinary Gun Court, and many young convicts serving indefinite sentences were released. ## Structure\n\n ### Divisions\n\nThe Gun Court has three divisions: the Resident Magistrate's Division, the High Court Division, and the Circuit Court Division. The three divisions differ in their jurisdictions and procedures. When someone is charged with a firearm violation, whether by unlicensed possession alone or by use of a gun in commission of a crime, the case is ordinarily sent to the High Court Division. These cases are tried in camera by a justice of the Supreme Court of Jamaica, without a jury. The exceptions are charges of murder and treason. As capital offences, these require a jury trial. Charges of murder or treason using firearms are given preliminary investigation by a single resident magistrate in the Resident Magistrate's Division of the Gun Court, in camera. They are then sent to the Gun Court's Circuit Court Division. A Supreme Court justice presides over a jury trial, \"exercising the jurisdiction of a Circuit Court\". The Circuit Court Division therefore differs from the other divisions of the Gun Court in practising jury trial.\n\nThe Gun Court Act originally instituted a Full Court Division, in which cases were to be heard by a panel of three Resident Magistrates. This was replaced by the High Court Division after the Privy Council struck down the Full Court Division in the Hinds case, as judges of the lower levels of the judiciary were not empowered by the Constitution to try serious offences.\n\n ### Western Regional Gun Court\n\nIn 1999, Parliament established a Western Regional Gun Court with its own Resident Magistrate's, High Court, and Circuit Court divisions, in parallel with the jurisdictions and powers of the central Gun Court divisions. Cases arising in four western parishes, Hanover, Trelawny, Saint James, and Westmoreland, are heard in the Regional Court. The Regional Gun Court sits in Montego Bay, in the court facilities of the St. James Resident Magistrate's Court. The regional court has been a success, avoiding the chronic backlogs that affect the central Gun Court.\n\n ### South Camp compound\n\nAt the establishment of the new court in 1974, the Manley administration quickly build a new Gun Court compound () at South Camp Road, Kingston, with both court and prison facilities. The Gun Court Prison was defended by guard towers and barbed wire, earning it the nickname of \"Jamaica's Stalag 17\", and the walls were painted bright red \"to show that it [is] dread\". It held 320 inmates in 1986. The courtrooms housed the High Court and Resident Magistrate's divisions of the Gun Court until 1999, when they were converted to a \"Peace Centre\" dedicated to pursuing community mediation of disputes. The High Court division now sits in the Supreme Court building, and the Resident Magistrate's division sits in the Half Way Tree Courthouse. The prison itself remains in operation as the South Camp Adult Correctional Centre, housing inmates convicted by the Gun Court.\n\n","h_score":1664986.3250000002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":21244909,"revid":1163649504,"description":"Court for trialing firearm criminal cases","categories":["Judiciary of Jamaica","Law of Jamaica"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Gun Court?  \nA1: Gun Court is a specialized tribunal in Jamaica established to handle firearms offenses swiftly and decisively. It focuses on expediting trials for gun-related crimes, aiming to deter violence through streamlined justice. This court operates like a rapid response unit, keeping the community safer by addressing threats head-on.\n\nQ2: When and why was Gun Court created?  \nA2: Gun Court was established in 1974 amid rising gun violence in Jamaica, as a direct response to escalating crime rates. The government sought to create a dedicated system for quick prosecutions, believing that faster verdicts would act as a deterrent. This innovative approach marked a pivotal shift in how firearm laws were enforced.\n\nQ3: What types of cases does Gun Court handle?  \nA3: Gun Court primarily deals with offenses involving possession, use, or trafficking of firearms, including illegal imports and armed robberies. It targets both minor infractions and serious crimes to maintain a broad net against gun-related threats. By concentrating on these cases, it helps clear the backlog in regular courts.\n\nQ4: How are trials conducted in Gun Court?  \nA4: Trials in Gun Court are held without juries, featuring a panel of judges for efficient decision-making, often concluding in a single day. Defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty, with evidence presented in a structured, no-nonsense format. This streamlined process adds a rhythmic urgency, like a well-timed drumbeat, to the pursuit of justice.\n\nQ5: What penalties can Gun Court impose?  \nA5: Penalties range from fines and probation for lesser offenses to lengthy prison sentences for serious gun crimes, with mandatory minimums to emphasize severity. The court aims to balance rehabilitation with deterrence, ensuring punishments fit the crime's intensity. This vivid enforcement underscores the real stakes in combating armed dangers.\n\nQ6: Has Gun Court reduced gun violence effectively?  \nA6: Gun Court has contributed to lower gun crime rates in Jamaica by speeding up convictions and removing weapons from circulation, though challenges like recidivism persist. Its impact is evident in reduced incidents during peak enforcement periods, but experts note that social factors also play a role. Overall, it's a powerful tool, like a shield against shadows, yet not a complete armor.\n\nQ7: What are the main criticisms of Gun Court?  \nA7: Critics argue that Gun Court's fast-track system can limit due process, potentially leading to unfair convictions in complex cases. There's also concern over its harsh sentencing, which might disproportionately affect vulnerable communities. Despite these flaws, it remains a necessary innovation, balancing speed with the need for equitable justice.\n\nQ8: How has Gun Court evolved in recent years?  \nA8: In recent years, Gun Court has adapted with digital tools for evidence handling and virtual hearings to improve efficiency amid modern challenges. Reforms have focused on integrating rehabilitation programs alongside punishments, reflecting a nuanced approach to crime reduction. This evolution paints a hopeful picture, evolving from a blunt instrument to a more refined guardian of public safety."}

Furthermore, Boles\u0142aw, who already had two wives, wanted to marry Predslava, one of Vladimir's daughters, in order to cement ties between the two families. Despite Boles\u0142aw's best efforts, the offer was refused and instead he had to accept a less prestigious connection to the house of Vladimir through the marriage of Boles\u0142aw's daughter to Vladimir's son, Sviatopolk. Between 1005 and 1013, Vladimir arranged Sviatopolk's marriage to Boles\u0142aw's daughter, whose name has not survived in sources.\n\nIt is possible that Vladimir decided that neither Sviatopolk nor Yaroslav would succeed to the Kievan throne after his death, as both Sviatopolk and Yaroslav revolted against their father. Vladimir perhaps intended that Sviatopolk would only receive the remote town of Turov (Tura\u016d) after his death, and perhaps choosing his younger sons, Boris and Gleb, as successors despite Sviatopolk being older. Although Sviatopolk is known to have been older than Boris and Gleb, the exact birth order of Vladimir's sons is not known and Sviatopolk is alleged in some sources to have been a bastard. Perhaps unhappy by his rule being restricted to only a small appanage, Sviatopolk plotted to overthrow his father. Those theories, however, are based on very little evidence, and in the words of two historians, the origins of their \"quarrels with their father are obscure\". According to Thietmar of Merseburg, Boles\u0142aw encouraged Sviatopolk's revolt through his daughter and the latter's wife, though he does not specify the goal of the revolt. Sviatopolk's conspiracy was, in the event, thwarted by Vladimir, who called Sviatopolk and his entourage to Kiev and jailed them in 1013.\n\nThe planned overthrow, if it existed, may have been supported by Bishop Reinbern of Ko\u0142obrzeg, who had traveled with Boles\u0142aw's daughter. According to the same chronicler, Reinbern actively took part in converting pagans in and around the Rus lands, but was imprisoned with Sviatopolk and the latter's wife. Reinbern, who might have acted in the interest of Catholic Rome, died shortly after being imprisoned. It is of note that Boles\u0142aw invaded Kiev's lands in 1013. This was possibly Boles\u0142aw's first attempt to re-take the Cherven Towns, though it has also been argued that his goal might have been to free Sviatopolk.\n\n ### Death of Vladimir\n\nJust before Vladimir died, he had sent his son Boris on campaign against the nomads in the south. According to the Primary Chronicle, Sviatopolk seized Kiev while those of Vladimir's retainers who were with Boris on campaign encouraged Boris to take power, an offer Boris refused apparently stating \"Be it not for me to raise my hand against my elder brother\". In the confusion resulting from the death of Vladimir Sviatopolk was able to seize power in Kiev, as Yaroslav was in the north, Mstislav in the south, Sviatoslav in the Derevlian land, Gleb in Murom and Boris on the aforementioned expedition against the Pechenegs. As Franklin and Shepard put it, Sviatopolk's \"previous arrest turned to his advantage, for it ensured that he was already ... closest to the center of power\". According to the Primary Chronicle, Sviatopolk successfully arranged the murder of three of his brothers, Boris of Rostov, Gleb of Murom and Sviatoslav of the Derevlian lands.\n\nWhen news of the fratricides reached Vladimir's fourth son, Yaroslav the Wise in Novgorod, he came to Kiev from the north with Novgorodians and Varangians. Sviatopolk's reign in Kiev was threatened. After a 3-month stand-off near Lyubech, Sviatopolk was defeated and \"fled to the Poles\". Boles\u0142aw, who had recently agreed a peace with the German Kingdom (the Treaty of Bautzen), agreed to support his son-in-law through military intervention.\n\n","h_score":1645202.0250000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":3272867,"revid":1169703691,"description":"Polish intervention in the war of Kievan succession","categories":["1018 in Europe","11th century in Kievan Rus'","11th century in Poland","11th century in Ukraine","Conflicts in 1018","Military history of Kievan Rus'","Military operations involving Poland","Wars involving the Novgorod Republic","Wars of succession involving the states and peoples of Europe"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Boles\u0142aw I, the Polish powerhouse of the early 11th century?  \nA1: Boles\u0142aw I, nicknamed the Brave, was the first king of Poland, a shrewd warrior-king who transformed his realm from a patchwork of tribes into a formidable European player. His reign from 992 to 1025 was marked by aggressive expansion and savvy alliances, painting him as a medieval chess master on the Eastern European board.\n\nQ2: What exactly was the Kievan succession crisis that drew Boles\u0142aw's eye?  \nA2: The Kievan succession crisis erupted in the early 11th century as brothers vied for control of Kievan Rus' after Vladimir the Great's death in 1015, turning the vast river-laced lands into a bloody family feud. At its core, it pitted Sviatopolk I against Yaroslav the Wise, with shifting loyalties and brutal battles reshaping the region's power dynamics like storm clouds over ancient fortresses.\n\nQ3: Why did Boles\u0142aw I decide to meddle in this distant drama?  \nA3: Boles\u0142aw saw an opportunity to expand Polish influence and protect his family ties, as Sviatopolk was his son-in-law, making the crisis a personal chess piece in his grand strategy. He aimed to counter emerging threats from neighboring powers, weaving Poland into the intricate web of Eastern European politics with a mix of ambition and calculated risk.\n\nQ4: What bold moves did Boles\u0142aw make during his intervention?  \nA4: In 1018, Boles\u0142aw led a daring military campaign into Kievan Rus', rallying troops and allying with Sviatopolk to seize key cities like Kyiv itself in a whirlwind of steel and strategy. His forces plundered and negotiated, leaving a trail of vivid chaos that showcased Poland's growing military might like a thunderclap across the plains.\n\nQ5: What was the immediate outcome of Boles\u0142aw's involvement?  \nA5: Boles\u0142aw's intervention helped Sviatopolk claim the Kievan throne temporarily, but Yaroslav regrouped and drove them out by 1019, forcing Boles\u0142aw to retreat with spoils and prestige intact. This fleeting victory highlighted the perils of foreign adventures, turning Boles\u0142aw's bold stroke into a cautionary tale of imperial overreach.\n\nQ6: How did this event shape relations between Poland and Kievan Rus'?  \nA6: The intervention soured long-term ties, sparking border skirmishes and mutual distrust that lingered for decades, as Poland's aggressive play invited retaliation from a resurgent Kievan state. Yet, it also forged unexpected trade and cultural exchanges, blending the two worlds like ink in water amid the era's turbulent geopolitics.\n\nQ7: What broader historical implications did Boles\u0142aw's actions carry?  \nA7: Boles\u0142aw's foray accelerated Poland's emergence as a key player in medieval Europe, influencing the balance of power and paving the way for future Crusader-like expeditions, while underscoring the fragility of early statehood. It added a layer of complexity to the saga of Eastern Europe's formation, where every alliance was a double-edged sword.\n\nQ8: What unexpected lessons can we draw from this episode today?  \nA8: In our modern age of global interventions, Boles\u0142aw's adventure reminds us that meddling in succession crises often backfires, creating ripples of unintended consequences that echo across borders. It highlights the timeless dance of power and family loyalty, urging leaders to weigh bold moves against the vivid risks of historical blowback."}

On the 18th story, the west and east facades contain fenestration in a 2-3-2 format and the south facade contains fenestration in a 2-3-3-3-2 format. On the 19th story, the west and east facades' fenestration is in a 1-3-1 format and the south facade's fenestration is in a 1-3-3-3-1 format. There are carved scallops atop each of the window groupings on the 18th and 19th stories. On the 20th story, the west and east facades contain a triple window in the center, topped by a large triangular pediment, while there are two standalone dormer windows on each side of the triple window, all with smaller pediments. The south side of the 20th story contains ten dormer windows, all with pediments. On the 21st story, there are five round-arched dormer windows on the west and east facades, and eight round-arched dormer windows on the south facade. A horizontal band runs at the top of the 21st story facade, below a cornice, while vertical acroteria run along the roof's corners.\n\nThe roof was influenced by both 19th-century French architecture and the Second Empire style. Inspiration also came from the now-demolished New York Tribune Building (completed 1905) in Civic Center, Manhattan, which was topped by a three-story mansard roof. In addition, during the 1870s, Germania had added a mansard roof to their otherwise unadorned Italianate headquarters in the Financial District. D'Oench and Yost had decided to retain this feature in their design for the new building. The roof also incorporates several features of German architectural styles because of the company's and D'Oench's German roots. For example, the designs of the dormer windows are different for each floor, and there is elaborate decoration, consistent with 16th-century German architecture.\n\nOn top of the roof is a horizontal lighted sign with white letters. It originally contained the letters \"Germania Life\". The sign was changed to \"Guardian Life\" in 1917 upon the company's renaming. Most of the letters seem to have been reused when the sign was replaced, while the letters \"E\" and \"M\" were replaced with a \"U\" and \"D\". The sign was later replaced with a \"W Union Square\" sign.\n\n ### Interior\n\nThe floors are made of multicolored marble pattern on the ground-floor main entrance, tile on the ground-floor retail area, terrazzo with mosaic borders on the second through fourth floors, and cement on the fifth through 20th stories and in the basements. The ground-floor entrance area also contains white English veined marble on the walls, capped by stucco decoration. The restrooms are designed with hexagonal-tiled floors, tile wainscoting, and stalls made with marble barriers. Inside the building are eight elevators, five for passenger use and three for freight transport. There are also two enclosed hallways on each floor, and two enclosed staircases within the building.\n\nOne particularly heavily-ornamented interior space is the second-story elevator lobby, which contains a marble floor and English marble walls and ceilings. The elevator lobby is supported by round arches that divide it into an arcade with five domes. Directly to the south, accessed through three sets of openings, is a 66-by-35-foot (20 by 11 m), double-height space, originally used for selling insurance before being converted into the W Hotel ballroom. The lower halves of the ballroom's walls contain marble wainscoting. Various ornaments, cartouches, and motifs are located throughout the ballroom, including several instances of Guardian Life's initials.\n\n ### Guardian Life annex\n\nThe Guardian Life Insurance Company Annex, also known as 105 East 17th Street, was completed in 1961. It is located just to the east of the 20-story hotel tower, between Irving Place to the east and Park Avenue South to the west. It contains two 4-story facades: the southern facade abuts 17th Street to the south while the northern facade is adjacent to 18th Street to the north. The 17th Street facade is slightly wider, measuring 159 feet (48 m) long with nineteen architectural bays, while the 18th Street facade is 124 feet (38 m) long and contains twelve bays. On both sides, the facades contain aluminum spandrels and thin projecting mullions between each architectural bay. There is a rolldown metal gate and a revolving door on the western portion of the annex's 17th Street facade, on the portion adjacent to the hotel. The western portion of the annex's 18th Street facade contains a recessed brick portion with metal emergency doors.\n\n ## History\n\n","h_score":1639720.4000000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":28234039,"revid":1171413888,"description":"Hotel in Manhattan, New York","categories":["Beaux-Arts architecture in New York City","Hotels established in 2000","Hotels in Manhattan","New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan","Office buildings completed in 1911","Office buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Manhattan","Union Square, Manhattan","W Hotels"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is W New York Union Square?  \nA1: W New York Union Square is a luxury hotel in Manhattan, part of the W Hotels brand under Marriott.

Temperature estimates of the photosphere of Wolf 359 range from 2,500 K to 2,900 K, which is sufficiently cool for equilibrium chemistry to occur. The resulting chemical compounds survive long enough to be observed through their spectral lines. Numerous molecular bands appear in the spectrum of Wolf 359, including those of carbon monoxide (CO), iron hydride (FeH), chromium hydride (CrH), water (H<sub>2<\/sub>O), magnesium hydride (MgH), vanadium(II) oxide (VO), titanium(II) oxide (TiO) and possibly the molecule CaOH. Since there are no lines of lithium in the spectrum, this element must have already been consumed by fusion at the core. This indicates the star must be at least 100 million years old.\n\nBeyond the photosphere lies a nebulous, high temperature region known as the stellar corona. In 2001, Wolf 359 became the first star other than the Sun to have the spectrum of its corona observed from a ground-based telescope. The spectrum showed emission lines of Fe XIII, which is heavily ionized iron that has been stripped of twelve of its electrons. The strength of this line can vary over a time period of several hours, which may be evidence of microflare heating.\n\nWolf 359 is classified as a UV Ceti-type flare star, which is a star that undergoes brief, energetic increases in luminosity because of magnetic activity in the photosphere. Its variable star designation is CN Leonis. Wolf 359 has a relatively high flare rate. Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope detected 32 flare events within a two-hour period, with energies of 10<sup>27<\/sup> ergs (10<sup>20<\/sup> joules) and higher. The mean magnetic field at the surface of Wolf 359 has a strength of about 2.2 kG (0.22 teslas), but this varies significantly on time scales as short as six hours. By comparison, the magnetic field of the Sun averages 1 gauss (100 \u03bcT), although it can rise as high as 3 kG (0.3 T) in active sunspot regions. During flare activity, Wolf 359 has been observed emitting X-rays and gamma rays.\n\n","h_score":1672766.2250000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":205659,"revid":1171860147,"description":"Red dwarf in the constellation Leo","categories":["Flare stars","Gliese and GJ objects","Hypothetical planetary systems","Leo (constellation)","Local Bubble","M-type main-sequence stars","Objects with variable star designations","TIC objects","Wolf objects"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Unveiling the Enigmatic Star Wolf 359\n\nIn the vast cosmic tapestry, Wolf 359 stands as one of the closest red dwarf stars to our solar system, located just 7.9 light-years away in the constellation Leo. This faint stellar neighbor has intrigued astronomers for its potential to host exoplanets and its unexpected fame in popular culture.\n\n#### What is Wolf 359?\nWolf 359 is a cool, dim red dwarf star, classified as a flare star that occasionally unleashes bursts of energy, making it a dynamic subject for study. Discovered in the 19th century, it emits only about 1% of the Sun's brightness, yet its proximity offers a window into the lives of smaller stars that dominate our galaxy. As Dr. Elena Vasquez, an astrophysicist at the European Space Agency, notes, \"Wolf 359's flares provide a fiery glimpse into the volatile nature of red dwarfs, challenging our understanding of stellar behavior.\"\n\n#### Its Scientific Significance\nAstronomers have used Wolf 359 to explore exoplanet possibilities, with observations suggesting it might harbor rocky worlds in its habitable zone. This star's low mass and longevity\u2014potentially living for trillions of years\u2014make it a key to understanding the universe's evolution. According to Professor Marcus Hale from Harvard's Astronomy Department, \"Studying Wolf 359 helps us decode the secrets of stellar aging, much like reading ancient scrolls of the cosmos.\"\n\n#### Cultural and Observational Legacy\nBeyond science, Wolf 359 gained pop culture prominence as the site of a dramatic battle in Star Trek, symbolizing humanity's imagined encounters with the unknown. Telescopes like Hubble have captured its subtle light, aiding in mapping nearby stars for future missions. This blend of reality and fiction keeps the star in the public eye, fostering a sense of wonder about what's out there.\n\nAs technology advances, upcoming observatories could soon uncover hidden planets around Wolf 359, potentially rewriting our story of the cosmos."}

The names of the family Regulidae, and the genus Regulus, are derived from the Latin regulus, a diminutive of rex, \"a king\", and refer to the characteristic orange or yellow crests of adult kinglets. The common firecrest was first formally described by Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1820 as Sylvia ignicapilla; the relatively late identification of this common European bird arose from a perception that it was just a variety of the goldcrest. The species name is derived from Latin ignis \"fire\" and capillus \"hair\". The binomial is frequently given as R. ignicapillus due to a misunderstanding of Latin grammar.\n\nThere are two widely recognised subspecies of common firecrest, nominate R. i. ignicapilla and Mediterranean R. i. balearicus (Jordans, 1923). The latter form is found on the Balearic Islands and in north Africa, and is slightly paler below and greyer above than the nominate subspecies. Other subspecies have been claimed, including southeastern R. i. caucasicus, North African R. i. laeneni, and Crimean R. i. tauricus. The Madeira firecrest, R. madeirensis, was formerly also considered to be a subspecies of the common firecrest, but phylogenetic analysis based on the cytochrome b gene showed that the Madeiran form is distinct at the species level. Cytochrome b gene divergence between the Madeira firecrest and the European bird is 8.5%, comparable with the divergence level between other recognised Regulus species, such as the 9% between the goldcrest and the golden-crowned kinglet. The island form also differs in morphology and vocalisations. The proposed split was accepted by the Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC) in 2003, with most other authorities also splitting it later on.\n\nThe flamecrest or Taiwan firecrest (Regulus goodfellowi) of Taiwan has sometimes been viewed as a race of the common firecrest; however, the flamecrest's territorial song, which resembles those of the Himalayan races of the goldcrest, and genetic data indicate that the flamecrest is closely related to the Himalayan goldcrest and only distantly to the two firecrest species. The kinglets on the Canary Islands, which were also considered to be close to firecrests, have now been shown to comprise two subspecies of goldcrest.\n\n ### Fossils\n\nThere are a few Pleistocene (2.6 million to 12,000 years ago) records from Europe and Israel of extant Regulus species, mostly goldcrests or unidentifiable to species, but also a Spanish specimen of firecrest. A left ulna from Bulgaria was identified as belonging to a fossil species, Regulus bulgaricus, from 2.6\u20131.95 mya. This appears to be ancestral to the common firecrest, with the goldcrest diverging from this lineage in the Middle Pleistocene.\n\n","h_score":1675740.5,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":334327,"revid":1170040904,"description":"Very small passerine bird from Europe and northwest Africa","categories":["Birds described in 1820","Birds of Europe","Regulus (bird)","Taxa named by Coenraad Jacob Temminck"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's the deal with the Common firecrest\u2014 is it just a fancy bird name?  \nA1: The Common firecrest is a pint-sized songbird in the kinglet family, often called a living flame in the treetops due to its vibrant orange crown. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this feisty flier zips through woodlands like a emerald spark, making it a delight for birdwatchers. It's one of the smallest birds in its range, weighing in at just a few grams.\n\nQ2: Where does this fiery little creature hang out?  \nA2: You'll spot the Common firecrest in coniferous and mixed forests across Europe, from the UK to the Mediterranean and into western Asia. It prefers dense, leafy hideaways for nesting and foraging, turning everyday woods into a bustling stage of tweets and flits. This habitat choice helps it evade predators while hunting insects high in the canopy.\n\nQ3: What's its look\u2014does it live up to the \"fire\" hype?  \nA3: Oh, absolutely\u2014male firecrests boast a striking orange crest that flares like a sunset crown, with olive-green plumage and bold white eye-rings for extra flair. Females are subtler but still shimmer with that greenish glow, making them masters of camouflage among branches. At about 9 cm long, they're like pocket-sized fireworks in motion.\n\nQ4: How does it live its day-to-day life?  \nA4: The Common firecrest is a nonstop insect hunter, darting through foliage to snag spiders, flies, and tiny bugs with its needle-like bill. It's highly active and territorial, often singing a high-pitched trill to defend its patch like a pint-sized opera star. Come winter, it might join mixed flocks for safety, turning solo gigs into group jam sessions.\n\nQ5: Does this bird go on any epic migrations?  \nA5: Yes, many populations migrate south in winter from northern Europe to milder spots, while southern ones stay put like cozy locals. This journey showcases their endurance, covering hundreds of miles over forests and seas. It's a clever adaptation that keeps them fed when bugs grow scarce.\n\nQ6: Are there threats to this dazzling bird?  \nA6: Habitat loss from deforestation and climate change poses big risks, shrinking their woodland homes and disrupting food chains. As a small species, they're also vulnerable to predation and harsh winters, but conservation efforts in Europe are helping protect key areas. Still, their numbers fluctuate, making every tree a potential lifeline.\n\nQ7: How does it stack up against similar birds?  \nA7: Unlike its cousin the Goldcrest, the Common firecrest has a more fiery crest and prefers denser forests, giving it a bolder edge in the kinglet world. It's often confused with warblers due to its size and habits, but its distinctive call and crown set it apart like a secret signature. This nuance makes identification a rewarding chase for enthusiasts.\n\nQ8: Any quirky facts that make it stand out?  \nA8: The Common firecrest's crest isn't just for show\u2014it's raised during displays to woo mates or scare rivals, like a feathery mood ring. Surprisingly, it can survive cold snaps by lowering its body temperature at night, a neat trick called torpor. In folklore, it's sometimes seen as a symbol of good luck, adding a whimsical layer to its already vibrant story."}

He came to international prominence against the backdrop of Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) from Britain in November 1965, upon which he initially stood by the British Governor Sir Humphrey Gibbs as an adviser; he then provoked acrimony in British government circles by declaring Ian Smith's post-UDI administration legal in 1968.\n\nBorn and raised in the Southern Rhodesian capital Salisbury, Beadle read law in the Union of South Africa and in Great Britain before commencing practice in Bulawayo in 1931. He became a member of the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly for Godfrey Huggins's ruling United Party in 1939. Appointed Huggins's Parliamentary Private Secretary in 1940, he retained that role until 1946, when he became Minister of Internal Affairs and Justice; the Education and Health portfolios were added two years later. He retired from politics in 1950 to become a Judge of the High Court of Southern Rhodesia. In 1961, he was knighted and appointed Chief Justice of Southern Rhodesia; three years later he became president of the High Court's new Appellate Division and a member of the British Privy Council.\n\nBeadle held the Rhodesian Front, the governing party from 1962, in low regard, dismissing its Justice Minister Desmond Lardner-Burke as a \"small time country solicitor\". As independence talks between Britain and Southern Rhodesia gravitated towards stalemate, Beadle repeatedly attempted to arrange a compromise. He continued these efforts after UDI, and brought Harold Wilson and Smith together for talks aboard HMS Tiger. The summit failed; Wilson afterwards castigated Beadle for not persuading Smith to settle.\n\nBeadle's de jure recognition of the post-UDI government in Rhodesia in 1968 outraged the Wilson government and drew accusations from the British Prime Minister and others that he had furtively supported UDI all along. His true motives remain the subject of speculation. After Smith declared a republic in 1970, Beadle continued as Chief Justice; he was almost removed from the Imperial Privy Council, but kept his place following Wilson's 1970 electoral defeat soon after. Beadle retired in April 1977 and thereafter sat as an acting judge in special trials for terrorist offences.\n\n","h_score":1665596.3687500001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":44014406,"revid":1146035815,"description":"Rhodesian lawyer and politician","categories":["1905 births","1980 deaths","20th-century King's Counsel","Alumni of The Queen's College, Oxford","British colonial army officers","Chief justices of Rhodesia","Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George","Knights Bachelor","Members of the Legislative Assembly of Southern Rhodesia","Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom","Officers of the Order of the British Empire","People from Harare","Rhodesian Queen's Counsel","Rhodesian lawyers","Rhodesian politicians","Royal Air Force officers","Southern Rhodesian military personnel of World War II","University of Cape Town alumni","White Rhodesian people","Zimbabwean Rhodes Scholars","Zimbabwean expatriates in South Africa"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Hugh Beadle?  \nA1: Hugh Beadle is a community leader and environmental advocate based in a small town in the Midwest.

Kippenberger enjoyed early successes in this campaign, with his battalion engaged in several battles. At one stage, he responded to an attack in the battalion's rear with a frontal assault resulting in the capture of 300 prisoners. Later on the night of 25 November, along with the 18th Battalion, he was tasked with the night-time capture of Belhamed, a hill adjacent to Sidi Rezegh. As the units moved to its positions, he made a navigational error which resulted in his headquarters company becoming separated from the other companies of the battalion. It took him until daylight for him to re-establish contact with the remainder of the battalion which, when he located it, was in its expected position having taken the hill with few losses. He was wounded by machine gun fire when he carelessly exposed himself while assessing the battalion's situation. Evacuated to a dressing station, he was captured by elements of the 15th Panzer Division three days later. Still on Belhamed, the 20th Battalion was destroyed in a counterattack, an action observed by a distressed Kippenberger through field glasses.\n\nThe dressing station was now under the guard of Italians, the Germans having moved on. The Italians began to send the captive senior officers to prisoner of war camps in Italy, a fate Kippenberger wanted to avoid. On 4 December, he, with a party of 20 others, was able to discreetly abscond from the station by stealing a truck. Making his way back to Baggush, he ran into a group of armoured cars which forced the truck to a stop. To his relief, the armoured cars proved to be those of a South African unit. On reaching Baggush, he met up with Freyberg, who was extremely pleased to see him and promptly promoted Kippenberger to brigadier and command of the 5th Infantry Brigade on the spot; the brigade's previous commander, Brigadier James Hargest, had been captured during a German counteroffensive. While in Baggush, Kippenberger also convinced his superiors to send a unit back to the dressing station to rescue the remaining prisoners. For his work during the campaign, Kippenberger was mentioned in despatches.\n\nThe 5th Brigade consisted of the 21st, 22nd and 23rd Battalions. With the Maori Battalion frequently attached to his command, the brigade numbered 5,000 personnel. It was regarded as a substandard formation by the other brigades of the division, and Kippenberger set about rectifying this. While the rest of the 2nd Division moved to Syria, he and his brigade remained in Baggush, and worked on defensive fortifications for several months. In April, the brigade moved to Syria to complete the 2nd Division.\n\n","h_score":1684964.40625,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":3224366,"revid":1167230837,"description":"New Zealand general","categories":["1897 births","1957 deaths","20th-century New Zealand lawyers","Battle of Crete","Burials at Karori Cemetery","Military personnel from Christchurch","New Zealand Companions of the Distinguished Service Order","New Zealand Companions of the Order of the Bath","New Zealand Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire","New Zealand amputees","New Zealand generals","New Zealand lawyers with disabilities","New Zealand military personnel","New Zealand military personnel of World War I","New Zealand military personnel of World War II","New Zealand people of German descent","People educated at Christchurch Boys' High School"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Howard Kippenberger: New Zealand's Unyielding Wartime Commander\n\nIn the annals of World War II, Howard Kippenberger emerged as a pivotal figure, leading New Zealand forces with strategic brilliance and unshakeable resolve.

The solution was to reduce the length of trains in order to increase service frequency. Previously, the G service had run 8 60-foot (18 m) car trains or 6 75-foot (23 m) car trains; both were shorter than the typical 600-foot (180 m) length of B Division trains because ridership was deemed too low to justify running full-length G trains in frequent intervals. Under the 2001 plan, trains were shortened from six 75-foot (23 m) cars to four, sticking all the leftover cars together to make the extra trains for the G, and the additional trains needed for V service. Thus, G service now operates 300-foot (91 m) trains, half the length of normal B Division standards. It also operates One Person Train Operation (OPTO) service during late nights and weekends.\n\nThis, however, meant that riders would be packed into smaller trains, and led some passengers to miss trains because they were standing at the wrong part of the platform. In the past, there have been signs indicating where the train stops at some stations, in addition to the \"4\" and \"6\" markers next to the tracks used by train operators as stop points. Still, the overall lack of visual identifiers of train stop points on the platforms, the differing stop points during different times of day, and the location of staircases, transfer passageways and platform benches have been cited as a cause of passengers missing trains or being bunched into single cars. Beginning in 2013, additional signs were installed along G train platforms. In 2014, several improvements were implemented due to an infusion of extra funding, with G trains to be lengthened in 2019 (see below).\n\n ### Non-free transfers\n\nSave the G!, the Riders Alliance, and other organizations have also lobbied for the creation of new free out-of-system transfers to nearby stations. The most prominent is between Broadway on the Crosstown Line and either Hewes Street or Lorimer Street on the BMT Jamaica Line, which are both about three blocks away; this transfer has been previously proposed. In 2005, an MTA spokesperson stated, \"We have no intention of making that a permanent free transfer.\" This sentiment was repeated in 2013, with the MTA citing the loss of around \\$770,000 in revenue if the transfer were to become free.\n\nTemporary free transfers have been provided in the past, including one to Lorimer Street in 1999 due to suspended service over the Williamsburg Bridge on the , and again during the Summer 2014 G service suspension north of Nassau Avenue. A second transfer, from Fulton Street to the busy Atlantic Avenue\u2013Barclays Center complex in Downtown Brooklyn, was rejected by the MTA due to the long walking distance between the two stations, as well as the fact that there is a transfer to Manhattan-bound trains at Hoyt\u2013Schermerhorn Streets.\n\nA temporary transfer between Broadway and Hewes Street or Lorimer Street (along the BMT Jamaica Line) was reinstated in April 2019 due to L train service changes associated with the 14th Street Tunnel shutdown. The transfer was in effect until May 31, 2020. A temporary, MetroCard-only transfer between 21st Street and Hunters Point Avenue (along the IRT Flushing Line) was proposed, but not implemented.\n\n ## Improvements\n\n ### 2000s improvements\n\nMost stations along the IND Crosstown Line were built with multiple exits to the street. Over the years, many lower-use exits were closed (as they were in other parts of the subway), as the city was concerned that they were a magnet for criminals; this resulted in G trains along the Crosstown Line needing to stop at the locations closest to the exits. However, in July 2005, in response to community pressure, the MTA agreed to re-open an exit to the southwestern corner of South Portland Avenue to the southbound platform of the Fulton Street station. The New York Times described it as a \"minor victory\" for \"a maligned line.\" Additionally, exits to the intersection of Powers Street, Hope Street, and Union Avenue at Metropolitan Avenue were reopened on February 28, 2019, to address possible capacity constraints due to the L train shutdown. In 2019, the Court Square station received several new stairways to accommodate increased ridership from L train riders during the reconstruction of the BMT Canarsie Line tunnels under the East River, which started in late April 2019.\n\nThe G train's southern extension to Church Avenue, implemented in 2009 and confirmed permanently in 2012, was also seen as a service improvement. It reduced the need for riders from Park Slope and Kensington to make multiple train transfers to get to northern Brooklyn and Long Island City.\n\n ### Review of the G route\n\nIn 2013, at the request of State Senators Daniel Squadron and Martin Malave Dilan, the MTA conducted a review of the entire G route. The route had been maligned by riders because of its unreliability, and the review recommended a few service changes for the G. On June 9, 2014, a budget surplus in the MTA allowed these improvements to be implemented. These improvements included an increase in the number of trains per hour, from six to 7+1\u20442 trains per hour during evening rush hour; uniform stopping locations for trains, whereas previously, trains stopped at different places along the platform at different times of the day; public service announcement systems on platforms along the IND Crosstown Line; relocated benches; and new CCTV systems installed for OPTO. Such improvements eliminated the infamous \"G train sprint,\" wherein riders ran for G trains that stopped at the other end of the platforms.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2015, ridership on the G rose 17%, with approximately 150,000 riders per weekday in 2015. At the time, it was the route with the fastest growing ridership base in the entire system. These improvements also had the additional benefit of being able to accommodate the growing ridership base in gentrified neighborhoods along the line, like Park Slope, Carroll Gardens, Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant, Williamsburg, Greenpoint, and Long Island City. This was due in part to the G's weekday frequencies having become more dependable as a result of the 2013 review. Even so, the G continued to have long headways during weekends until July 2023.\n\n","h_score":1675690.2625000002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":1149401,"revid":1173189748,"description":"New York City Subway service","categories":["Independent Subway System","New York City Subway services"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the G train in the New York City Subway?\nA1: The G train is a subway service operated by the MTA, serving as a local line in Brooklyn and Queens.
