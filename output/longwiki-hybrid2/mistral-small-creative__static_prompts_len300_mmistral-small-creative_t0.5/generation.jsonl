Reflecting on his early years in the league, Javie told Sports Illustrated in October 2000, \"I'd get so mad I'd lose control for two or three minutes, and that's when I would miss calls.\" Javie developed mentorships with referees Joe Crawford and Jack Madden to assist in the maturation process. Working his debut game with Crawford at the Pontiac Silverdome in Detroit, Michigan, Javie received a grade of 40 points out of 100 by supervisor Darell Garretson. While reviewing game film later at the hotel, Crawford noted errors made throughout the game by himself. As a result of this film study, Javie learned that experienced officials make mistakes and admitting error will improve a referee's ability in the long-term. Ninety minutes after the conclusion of a game, Javie reviews game film. In addition to film review, Madden taught Javie not to lose focus when players and coaches were upset, and to walk away from them rather than becoming angry. Javie credited his mentors for success as a referee saying, \"My mentors have made me what I am today. I'm a little part of each of them. It's their success in teaching me.\" Javie had an on-court incident during the 1990\u201391 NBA season in a game between the Portland Trail Blazers and Washington Bullets. Bullets' forward Pervis Ellison threw the ball at referee Billy Spooner prompting Javie to run across the court to impose a technical foul on Ellison. In the sequence of events that followed, Javie ejected Ellison after protesting the call, the Bullets' head coach Wes Unseld for protesting the dismissal of Ellison, and the Bullets' mascot, \"Hoops\", for making gestures to incite the crowd. Rod Thorn, then the NBA's vice president for operations, ruled that Javie overreacted in ejecting Ellison and would be subject to discipline. The extent of the disciplinary action was not disclosed. Javie reflected on the experience saying, \"My fatal mistake was getting involved with Billy [Spooner] and Pervis [Ellison] in the first place. You have to be there for your partners, but most of the time you've got to let them call their game.\" Nearly three years later in another game involving the Portland Trail Blazers, Trail Blazers radio broadcast analyst Mike Rice was ejected by Javie for disputing calls from his broadcast position. During the 2002\u201303 NBA season, Javie was fined \\$1,000 by the league for a verbal altercation with Pat Riley, then-head coach of the Miami Heat. In April 2003, Javie was the referee in Michael Jordan's final game of his fifteen-year NBA career. During a game break towards the end of regulation, Javie congratulated Jordan on his career and told him he was a \"class act\". Javie then turned around and told the younger players on the court, \"You could do a lot worse than modeling yourselves after this guy.\" #### Income tax evasion trial\n\nIn January 1999, Javie was the only one of fifteen referees to be acquitted of tax evasion charges as a result of not reporting income he received by downgrading airline tickets provided by the league. Other referees were sentenced to probation or a period of house arrest, and ordered to pay the taxes. He fought the charges because he believed he did not intentionally do anything wrong. Discussing the trial, Javie told Referee magazine, \"My job is about my name. My dad taught me your name is the most important thing. I had to fight for my name.\" During the trial, Javie argued that he didn't owe taxes on more than \\$84,000 in income over three years because the money was value-earned from frequent flyer miles, which are non-taxable. He later described the trial as \"the hardest two weeks\" of his life.\n\n #### Retirement\n\nJavie announced his retirement before the beginning of the 2011\u201312 season.\n\nOn June 22, 2017, Javie was one of four new inductees into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame in Troy, Michigan. He was the recipient of Sports Faith International's Father Smyth Award on May 22, 2021.\n\nHe is a permanent deacon in the Catholic Church.\n\n ### Media career\n\nIn June 2012, it was announced that Javie would join NBA on ESPN, serving as a rules analyst working marquee games during the season and throughout the NBA Playoffs. Javie also appears on ESPN programming to discuss controversial referee occurrences.","h_score":1635285.4812500002,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":5111492,"revid":1162123304,"description":"American basketball referee (born 1955)","categories":["1955 births","American people of Polish descent","ESPN people","Living people","National Basketball Association referees","Sportspeople from Philadelphia","Temple University alumni"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Q1: Who is Steve Javie, and what is his professional background?**\nA1: Steve Javie is a former NFL offensive lineman who played for the New York Giants (1987\u20131996) and the New England Patriots (1997).

There are six servants, and one mill of 10s. There are ten acres of meadow and thirty acres of pasture. In the time of the Confessor, it was worth 40 shillings when he received it four pounds, now 100 shillings. In the time of king Edward the Confessor, two men, Leuuin and Uluuin, held this land in coparcenary, and could turn themselves over with this land to whomever they would.\" Thus there were three manors within the parish; Ditton Manor, with the appendant Brampton Manor, and Sifletone, all of which were owned by the Bishop of Bayeux at this time. The Bishop of Bayeaux was Odo, Earl of Kent, half brother of William the Conqueror. In 1082, after it was discovered that Odo planned a military expedition to Italy, he was imprisoned, and his estates (including Ditton, Brampton, and Sifletone) were confiscated to the Crown. Following this, Ditton Manor appears to have been held by the Clares, earls of Gloucester, by a family who assumed their surname from Ditton. Likewise, Sifletone was confiscated and went to another family who took their surname from it. Ditton has a ford which, along with St Peter's Ad Vincula's Church, is situated in a conservation area on the west of a large green. The church is dated to the 12th century with a later 14th-century tower, and the first bell of Ditton church was hung there in 1656. Ditton parish register has as its opening words, \"The Register book of Ditton beginning Anno Dom. 1663. William Jole, rector, inducted Rector of Ditton, 1st August, Anno Dom. 1663. \" Also at the commencement, it is recorded, on 1 August 1711, that every acre of woodland in the parish of Ditton by immemorial custom pays tithe to the rector. In 1798 Ditton was recorded as being within the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Diocese of Rochester, and deanery of Malling. This parish, among others, was obliged to contribute to the repair of the fifth pier of Rochester bridge. The church was restored in 1860 by Sir George Gilbert Scott. The north nave window has fragments of fourteenth-century glass, and the nave has a good selection of hanging wall monuments and a benefactions board. A lead plaque on the nave wall, removed from the tower roof in 1859, has a picture of a ship from Nelson's time scratched on it. The mill that was recorded in the Domesday Book, Church Mill, was located close to the ford and closed down around 1912. In 1798 the parish was described in the following terms: \"The high road from London, through Wrotham, to Maidstone, crosses the middle of it, at the thirty-first milestone;","h_score":1585807.84375,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":6843140,"revid":1162207172,"description":null,"categories":["Civil parishes in Kent","Local Nature Reserves in Kent","Villages in Kent"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Q1: Where is Ditton, Kent, located?**\nA1: Ditton is a small village in the English county of Kent, situated roughly 3 miles northeast of the town of Maidstone.

Enter the **air well (condenser)**, a critical but often overlooked component that\u2019s helping slash energy use by up to 40% in some facilities. Here\u2019s how it works, why it matters, and what\u2019s next for this unsung hero of climate-conscious computing.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is an Air Well?**\nAn air well, or **air-cooled condenser**, is a heat-exchange system that replaces traditional water-based cooling in data centers. Instead of relying on chilled water loops or evaporative cooling towers\u2014both of which demand significant energy\u2014it uses ambient air to dissipate heat from servers and other equipment. The process is simple: hot air from the data center is blown over finned tubes containing refrigerant, which absorbs the heat before releasing it outside. The cooled refrigerant then cycles back to absorb more heat, creating a closed-loop system.\n\n\u201cAir wells eliminate the need for water-intensive cooling, which is a game-changer in regions facing drought or water restrictions,\u201d says **Dr. Elena Vasquez**, a cooling systems engineer at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. \u201cThey also reduce the risk of leaks or corrosion, which plague water-based systems.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### **Why Are They Gaining Traction?**\nThe shift toward air wells is driven by two major factors: **energy efficiency** and **sustainability**. Traditional data center cooling can account for 30\u201340% of a facility\u2019s total energy consumption. Air-cooled condensers cut this by leveraging natural convection and require no pumps or water treatment, reducing operational costs and carbon footprints.\n\nCompanies like **Microsoft and Google** have already deployed air-well systems in newer facilities, particularly in arid climates where water scarcity is a concern. \u201cThe technology isn\u2019t new, but advancements in heat-transfer materials and AI-driven airflow optimization are making it far more effective,\u201d notes **Mark Chen**, director of infrastructure at a major hyperscale data center operator. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a 20\u201330% improvement in cooling efficiency compared to older air-cooled designs.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, air wells align with global sustainability goals. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that data centers could consume **20% of the world\u2019s electricity by 2025**\u2014making efficient cooling not just a cost-saving measure, but an environmental imperative.\n\n---\n\n### **Challenges and the Road Ahead**\nDespite their advantages, air wells aren\u2019t a one-size-fits-all solution. Their effectiveness depends on **local climate**: they perform best in dry, cool environments and struggle in humid or extremely hot regions, where high outdoor temperatures reduce heat dissipation. Some data centers still rely on hybrid systems, combining air cooling with liquid immersion or adiabatic cooling for peak loads.\n\nLooking forward, **innovations in materials science**\u2014such as graphene-enhanced heat sinks or phase-change materials\u2014could further boost air-well efficiency, even in challenging climates. As the tech matures, expect to see wider adoption, particularly as governments and corporations tighten energy regulations. The future of data center cooling may well be blowing in the wind\u2014literally."}

He said \"It was a dream to join the team I have supported all my life\". The Daily Mirror printed that \"Hughes has red hair, tattoos of a Tasmanian devil and a British bulldog on his forearms, dynamite in his boots and Albion in his blood.\" Fans affectionately nicknamed him the \"Ginger Ninja\".\n\nHe made his debut at The Hawthorns as a substitute in a 2\u20131 win over Tranmere Rovers on 9 August 1997. Seven days later he scored two goals from the bench in a 3\u20132 win over Crewe Alexandra at Gresty Road. Though signed by Ray Harford, he came to the fore under new boss Denis Smith. Smith handed Hughes his first start on 28 December, in a 1\u20131 home draw with Stoke City. He finished his debut season as the club's top-scorer with 14 goals in 41 appearances, and was rewarded with a new four-year contract.\n\nHe started the 1998\u201399 season in fine form, and claimed his first ever hat-trick in a 3\u20130 win over Port Vale at Vale Park on 22 August. Despite having recently signed a long-term contract, his form and goal record led to constant rumours of a big money move to a host of Premier League clubs. West Brom eventually issued a \"hands-off\" warning to other clubs. He claimed further hat-tricks against Crystal Palace and Huddersfield Town, and finished the season with 32 goals in 45 games. This tally left him as the country's top-scorer. He was named on the PFA Team of the Year for the First Division. He then submitted a written transfer request, and his spokesman told the press that there have \"been a number of things going on behind the scenes which have unsettled him recently\". In particular, his \u00a31,400 a week salary was compared with the \u00a35,000 a week salary of under-performing teammate Fabian de Freitas.\n\nHe remained at the club for the 1999\u20132000 season and scored 17 goals in 43 appearances. Albion struggled in the First Division under new manager Brian Little, though improved after Gary Megson replaced Little as manager in March and avoided relegation despite Hughes missing the final five matches of the season due to a knee injury.\n\nHe was partnered with Jason Roberts for the 2000\u201301 season; the pair went on to score 40 goals between them to help secure the \"Baggies\" a play-off place. With 23 goals to his name, he again attracted interest from other clubs. He claimed two hat-tricks in seven days against Gillingham and Preston North End. Hughes converted a penalty in a 2\u20132 draw with Bolton Wanderers in the first leg of the play-off semi-final, before a 3\u20130 defeat at the Reebok Stadium ended Albion's play-off hopes. He refused to sign a new contract in July 2001, and was placed on the transfer list.\n\n ### Coventry City\n\nHughes was sold to Gordon Strachan's Coventry City for a club record transfer fee of \u00a35,000,001 (the unusual figure was because any offer exceeding \u00a35 million would trigger an escape clause in his West Brom contract) in August 2001. His wages at Highfield Road were reported to be \u00a315,000 a week. Hughes scored 14 goals in 40 games, including a hat-trick in a 6\u20131 win at Crewe Alexandra, and finished the 2001\u201302 season as the club's top-scorer. Coventry rejected a loan offer from West Bromwich Albion in March 2002, and ended the season outside the play-offs.\n\n ### Return to West Bromwich Albion\n\nIn August 2002, Hughes returned to West Bromwich Albion for a club record \u00a32.5 million \u2013 half the fee Albion had received for him a year earlier \u2013 and signed a four-year deal with the club. Despite being a regular in the first team, Hughes failed to score a single Premier League goal in the 2002\u201303 season and Albion were relegated in 19th place with just six wins and 26 points from 38 matches. Hughes was criticised by several teammates following the club's 1\u20130 defeat by Everton at Goodison Park, though was publicly backed by manager Gary Megson. He told the press that \"I want to establish myself in the Premiership and any accusations of me not pulling my weight should be made to my face.\" He put his poor form down to him missing pre-season training with injury problems. He rediscovered his form back in the First Division, scoring 12 goals in 36 games in 2003\u201304 as West Brom secured promotion with a second-place finish. His contract at West Bromwich Albion was immediately terminated in August 2004, following his conviction for causing death by dangerous driving. He spent the next three years in prison, serving half of his six-year sentence.\n\n","h_score":1607280.71875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":1623709,"revid":1171343796,"description":"English footballer (born 1976)","categories":["1976 births","AFC Telford United players","Blackpool F.C. players","Coventry City F.C. players","Cradley Town F.C. players","England men's semi-pro international footballers","English Football League players","English football managers","English men's footballers","English people convicted of assault","English prisoners and detainees","Footballers from Smethwick","Forest Green Rovers F.C. players","Grantham Town F.C. players","Halesowen Town F.C. managers","Halesowen Town F.C. players","Ilkeston F.C. players","Kidderminster Harriers F.C. players","Living people","Male criminals","Men's association football forwards","Men's association football player-managers","Mickleover F.C. players","Middlesex Wanderers A.F.C. players","National League (English football) players","Northern Premier League players","Notts County F.C. players","Nuneaton Borough F.C. players","Oldham Athletic A.F.C. players","Port Vale F.C. players","Premier League players","Prisoners and detainees of England and Wales","Southern Football League managers","Southern Football League players","Sportspeople convicted of crimes","Stourport Swifts F.C. players","West Bromwich Albion F.C. players","Worcester City F.C. managers","Worcester City F.C. players"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Q1: Who is Lee Hughes, and what is his professional background?**\nA1: Lee Hughes is a former professional footballer, best known for his career as a striker in the English Football League.

The film reunites Taylor with Stephen Dorff, who both starred in the 1996 film I Shot Andy Warhol. - Chris Adamson as Doctor Lang Chris Adamson's renewed interest in the horror film genre stemmed from his viewing of 1931's Frankenstein. To prepare for his role in Leatherface, he watched The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and the 2003 remake, preferring the former: \"It seemed to have an innocence somehow compared to some of the chopped up limb movies which I have sometimes worked on.\" The character Doctor Lang is the director of the mental institution from which Jedidiah Sawyer and the other inmates escape; the Gorman House Youth Reformery. - Finn Jones as Deputy Sorells Hal Hartman's fellow law enforcement officer. - James Bloor as Ike - Jessica Madsen as Clarice Clarice is one of the escaped inmates and was originally intended to be an homage to Chop Top Sawyer, a character from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, but was later developed into her own character. Sherwood stated that the \"DNA\" of Chop Top is present in Clarice, describing him as his favourite Sawyer. A revisionist take on Chop Top was added due to the diminished role of the family in earlier drafts of the script, but was removed when the filmmakers began to feel that she was more of a \"rip-off\" than a genuine tribute. The version of Clarice that appears in the final film emerged when Sherwood imagined \"an image of this little girl in pigtails burning down her house with her parents inside\". Out of all the performances in Leatherface, Sherwood called Jessica Madsen's the most accurate of what he envisioned while writing. Deciding that Clarice is \"much more than just a pyromaniac\", Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo removed scenes detailing her backstory, such as her weaponising fire for the first time, her addiction for watching moving flames, and exposition on her family's disappearance. As the film begins, it remains ambiguous as to which inmate is actually Jedidiah Sawyer, the eventual Leatherface. Maury and Bustillo even considered leading the audience to believe that Clarice could become the titular character, \"It wasn\u2019t a so crazy idea to have regarding the passion Leatherface had for dresses and makeup in the previous movies.\" - Sam Coleman as Bud Sam Coleman portrays Bud, a hulking mental patient that escapes the institution with Jackson, Clarice, and Ike. Additionally, Julian Kostov portrays Ted Hardesty in the film, the father of Sally and Franklin Hardesty, the final girl and her brother from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Although his role is brief, there was going to be an additional scene exploring his family that was removed for budgetary reasons. Nubbins Sawyer, the older brother of Leatherface known simply as \"The Hitchhiker\" in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, is played by Dejan Angelov. Lorina Kamburova fills the role of Hal Hartman's daughter, whose death sets the plot into motion, while Boris Kabakchief plays Jedidiah Sawyer in his child years. Other acting credits include Dimo Alexiev, Nathan Cooper, and Nicole Andrews. ## Production\n\n","h_score":1597651.7937500002,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":46860810,"revid":1171638602,"description":"2017 American horror film directed by Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo","categories":["2010s American films","2010s English-language films","2017 films","2017 horror films","American horror films","American prequel films","Films about cannibalism","Films directed by Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo","Films scored by John Frizzell (composer)","Films set in 1955","Films set in 1965","Films set in Texas","Films set in psychiatric hospitals","Films shot in Bulgaria","GA-Class film articles","Lionsgate films","Necrophilia in film","The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise) films"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Leatherface (2017): How the Texas Chainsaw Massacre Prequel Rebooted a Horror Icon\"**\n\n*Director David Ayer\u2019s 2017 film reimagined the origins of *The Texas Chainsaw Massacre*\u2019s most infamous killer\u2014but divided fans with its brutal tone and controversial choices. Here\u2019s how the prequel reshaped the franchise and its legacy.*\n\n---\n\n### **A Darker, Grittier Origin Story**\n*Leatherface* (2017) serves as a prequel to Tobe Hooper\u2019s 1974 classic, exploring how the Sawyer family\u2019s descent into madness began. Set in 1960s Texas, the film follows a young Leatherface (played by Sam Witherington) as he\u2019s groomed by his deranged family\u2014including his mother, the matriarchal figure who wields the chainsaw. Unlike the original\u2019s folk-horror atmosphere, Ayer\u2019s version leans into visceral gore and psychological torment, framing Leatherface as both victim and monster.\n\nCritics praised the film\u2019s commitment to its grim tone but criticized its pacing. *\"The movie doesn\u2019t flinch from the horror, but it sometimes forgets to make us care about the characters,\"* said film critic **Ignatiy Vishnevetsky** for *The A.V. Club*. The Sawyer family\u2019s backstory\u2014rooted in trauma and isolation\u2014adds depth, though some argued it overshadowed the original\u2019s mythic simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### **Controversies and Creative Choices**\nThe film sparked debate over its portrayal of violence, particularly against women. Scenes depicting the Sawyer family\u2019s murders were condemned as excessively graphic, even by horror standards. Producer **Bill Block** defended the approach, stating, *\"We wanted to show how horror is born\u2014not just the acts, but the environment that creates them.\"* The film also reimagined Leatherface\u2019s mask, using a more realistic (and unsettling) pig-skin design, a departure from the original\u2019s iconic burlap sack.\n\nAnother point of contention was the film\u2019s runtime\u2014nearly two hours\u2014which some felt dragged despite its high-stakes moments. Unlike the original\u2019s tight, claustrophobic tension, *Leatherface* (2017) unfolds methodically, prioritizing atmosphere over relentless scares.\n\n---\n\n### **Legacy and Fan Reception**\nDespite mixed reviews, the film performed well at the box office, grossing over $50 million worldwide. It reignited interest in the *Texas Chainsaw Massacre* franchise, paving the way for *Leatherface* (2022)\u2014a spiritual successor rather than a direct sequel. Hardcore fans, however, remain divided: some appreciate its ambition, while others view it as an unnecessary detour from the original\u2019s raw power.\n\nFor horror enthusiasts, the 2017 *Leatherface* remains a fascinating experiment\u2014one that asks whether a prequel can honor its source material while carving its own path. The answer may lie in how future films in the franchise choose to balance legacy and innovation."}

Members took sides in the dispute, which led to synagogue disturbances, a contested election, and eventually to Ash's taking Rothstein to a United States court to try to oust him as president of the congregation. After the court rejected Ash's arguments, a large majority of members left with Ash to form Beth Hamedrash Hagodol (\"Great House of Study\"), adding the word \"Hagodol\" (\"Great\") to the original name. The followers of Rothstein stayed at the Allen Street location and retained the name \"Beth Hamedrash\" until the mid-1880s. With membership and financial resources both severely reduced, they were forced to merge with Congregation Holche Josher Wizaner; the combined congregation adopted the name \"Kahal Adath Jeshurun\", and built the Eldridge Street Synagogue. According to Eisenstein, Beth Hamedrash Hagodol provided an atmosphere that was \"socially religious\", in which Jews \"combine[d] piety with pleasure; they call[ed] their shule a shtibl or prayer-club room; they desire[d] to be on familiar terms with the Almighty and abhor[red] decorum; they want[ed] everyone present to join and chant the prayers; above all they scorn[ed] a regularly ordained cantor.\" In contrast to the informality of the services, members scrupulously observed the Jewish dietary laws, and every member personally oversaw the baking of his matzos for use on Passover. The congregation initially moved to the top floor of a building at the corner of Grand and Forsyth Streets, and in 1865 moved again, to a former courthouse on Clinton Street. In 1872, the congregation built a synagogue at Ludlow and Hester Streets. There the congregation's younger members gained greater control and introduced some minor innovations; for example, changing the title of parnas to president, and in 1877 hiring a professional cantor\u2014Judah Oberman\u2014for \\$500 (today \\$) per year, to bring greater formality and decorum to the services as well as to attract new members. While somewhat \"Americanized\", in general the congregation remained quite traditional. Men and women sat separately, the full service in the traditional prayer book was followed, and the congregation still trained men for rabbinic ordination. Additionally, Talmud and Mishna study groups, founded in the 1870s, were held both mornings and evenings. Ash had only served as Beth Hamedrash Hagodol's rabbi intermittently during this time; during the American Civil War he had briefly been a successful manufacturer of hoopskirts, before losing his money, and returning to the rabbinate. Congregants had a number of issues with him, including his outside business ventures and an alleged inclination towards Hasidism. The more learned members of the congregation contested his scholarship. Ash resigned as rabbi in 1877, and in 1879, directors of Beth Hamedrash Hagodol proposed that a Chief Rabbi be hired for New York. A number of New York City synagogues formed the \"United Hebrew Orthodox Congregations\", and agreed to select the Malbim (Me\u00efr Leibush ben Jehiel Michel Weiser) for the role. The appointment was announced in Philadelphia's Jewish Record, but the Malbim never filled the position. Beth Hamedrash Hagodol re-hired Ash to fill the vacant role of congregational rabbi at a salary of \\$25 per month (or \\$300\u2014today \\$\u2014per year). The following year the congregation hired a new cantor, Simhe Samuelson, for \\$1,000 (today \\$) a year, over three times Ash's salary.","h_score":1615624.6187500001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":10212125,"revid":1127278856,"description":"Synagogue in Manhattan, New York City","categories":["1852 establishments in New York (state)","Buildings and structures demolished in 2019","Churches completed in 1850","Demolished buildings and structures in Manhattan","Former New York City Designated Landmarks","Former churches in New York City","Former synagogues in New York (state)","Gothic Revival architecture in New York City","Gothic Revival synagogues","Lower East Side","New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan","Orthodox synagogues in New York City","Properties of religious function on the National Register of Historic Places in Manhattan","Religious organizations established in 1852","Russian-Jewish culture in New York City","Synagogues completed in 1885","Synagogues in Manhattan","Synagogues on the National Register of Historic Places in New York City","Ukrainian-Jewish culture in New York City"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Beth Hamedrash Hagodol: A Historic Synagogue at the Heart of Jewish Life in Brooklyn**\n\n*For over a century, Beth Hamedrash Hagodol has served as a cornerstone of Orthodox Jewish worship and community in Williamsburg, Brooklyn\u2014balancing tradition with the evolving needs of its congregants.*\n\n---\n\n### **A Legacy of Tradition and Adaptation**\nFounded in 1905 by Eastern European immigrants, Beth Hamedrash Hagodol (BH\"G) began as a small *shul* (synagogue) in a tenement on South 2nd Street. Today, its sprawling complex on Lee Avenue includes a main sanctuary, a women\u2019s section, a mikveh (ritual bath), and a yeshiva (religious school). The synagogue\u2019s name\u2014Hebrew for \"The Great House of Study\"\u2014reflects its dual role as a place of prayer and Torah learning.\n\nRabbi Yisroel Dovid Weiss, BH\"G\u2019s spiritual leader since 1986, notes the synagogue\u2019s resilience: *\"We\u2019ve weathered wars, economic hardships, and demographic shifts, but our commitment to *kedushah* [holiness] and *klal Yisrael* [the Jewish people] has never wavered.\"* Under his leadership, BH\"G expanded its educational programs, including a renowned *kollel* (advanced Talmudic study program) that attracts scholars from around the world.\n\n---\n\n### **Architectural Grandeur and Community Hub**\nBH\"G\u2019s current sanctuary, completed in 1929, is a landmark of Moorish Revival architecture, featuring a domed ceiling, stained-glass windows, and a towering *aron kodesh* (ark). The building\u2019s design symbolizes the fusion of Old World Jewish craftsmanship and American ambition. Beyond worship, the synagogue hosts major lifecycle events\u2014bar mitzvahs, weddings, and funerals\u2014and serves as a gathering place for Williamsburg\u2019s tight-knit Orthodox community.\n\nThe synagogue\u2019s influence extends beyond its walls. Its affiliated organizations, such as the *Bikur Cholim* (sick-visitation) society and *Gemach* (free-loan) program, provide practical support to residents. \"This isn\u2019t just a synagogue; it\u2019s a lifeline for so many families,\" says Sarah Levy, a long-time member and volunteer. \"Whether it\u2019s a meal after a funeral or tutoring for a child, BH\"G shows up.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Challenges and a Future Rooted in the Past**\nLike many historic institutions, BH\"G faces modern pressures, from rising costs to intergenerational shifts in religious observance. Yet its leadership emphasizes continuity over change. \"We don\u2019t chase trends,\" Rabbi Weiss says. \"Our strength lies in staying true to the traditions that brought us here while meeting today\u2019s realities with openness.\"\n\nLooking ahead, BH\"G aims to preserve its role as a unifying force in a rapidly changing neighborhood, ensuring that its doors\u2014and its values\u2014remain open to future generations."}

The team, especially Lt. Colonel Mitchell (Ben Browder), is reluctant to help. Mitchell is excited about his next off-world mission because it marks his 200th trip through the Stargate. Technical glitches prevent the team from setting off on their mission. General Landry (Beau Bridges) orders SG-1 to help Lloyd, as the government believes a successful science fiction film about intergalactic wormhole travel will serve as a good cover story to keep the real Stargate program a secret.\n\nThe notes session devolves into the team members pitching their own versions of a successful sci-fi film, including a zombie invasion (from Mitchell), a previously unseen mission where O'Neill became invisible (from Carter), \"tributes\" to The Wizard of Oz and Farscape (from Vala), and Teal'c as a private investigator (from Teal'c himself). Also featured are a vignette of the team's mental image of a \"younger and edgier\" SG-1 (sparked by the studio's suggestion to replace the original Wormhole X-Treme cast), a suggested scene by Martin that turns out to be both scientifically inaccurate and highly derivative of Star Trek, a re-imagined version of the SG-1 pilot episode where all the characters are marionettes in the style of the television series Thunderbirds, and an imagined wedding that features the return of General O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson). The studio decides to cancel the movie in favor of renewing the series. The end of the episode shifts ten years into the future, where the Wormhole X-Treme cast and crew celebrate their 200th episode, as well as renewed plans for a movie.\n\n","h_score":1593437.675,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":4582725,"revid":1161162688,"description":null,"categories":["2006 American television episodes","Stargate SG-1 episodes"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Stargate SG-1\u2019s *200*: How a Sci-Fi Icon Defied the Odds and Rewrote TV History\"**\n\n*After 10 years of wormholes, aliens, and heart-stopping cliffhangers, *Stargate SG-1* proved that a cult sci-fi show could become a cultural juggernaut\u2014without ever leaving the shadows of the *X-Files*. Now, as the franchise celebrates its 200th episode milestone, fans and critics alike are asking: How did a military-sci-fi hybrid with a $1 million-per-episode budget outlast its peers, spawn a universe, and leave an indelible mark on pop culture?*\n\n---\n\n### **From Niche Obsession to Mainstream Phenomenon**\nWhen *Stargate SG-1* premiered in 1997, it was a gamble: a high-concept sci-fi series about a secret military team exploring alien worlds through an ancient device. Early ratings were modest, but the show\u2019s blend of *Star Trek* idealism, *Indiana Jones* adventure, and *The X-Files\u2019* mystery hooked a devoted fanbase. By its third season, it had not only found its footing but had also become a syndication darling, airing in 56 countries and racking up millions of viewers.\n\nThe secret? A formula that balanced serialized storytelling with self-contained episodes, ensuring both binge-worthy depth and easy accessibility. \"We knew we had something special when fans started treating the show like a religion,\" said **Brad Wright**, one of the series\u2019 co-creators. \"They didn\u2019t just watch\u2014they *lived* it. Conventions, fan fiction, even real-life Stargate replicas.

The franchise spawned *Stargate Atlantis* (2004), *Stargate Universe* (2009), and a 2008 big-screen reboot, *Stargate: The Ark of Truth*, proving its staying power. Merchandise, from action figures to board games, turned the show into a multimedia empire, while its themes of exploration, sacrifice, and humanity\u2019s place in the cosmos resonated far beyond sci-fi circles.\n\nThe show\u2019s influence extended to real-world science, too. NASA scientists have cited *SG-1* as inspiration for discussions on interstellar travel, and its depiction of ancient alien civilizations sparked debates about archaeology and mythology. \"It\u2019s rare for a TV show to bridge entertainment and education like this,\" said **Dr. Emily Carter**, a cultural anthropologist who studies sci-fi\u2019s impact. \"SG-1 made the impossible feel *plausible*\u2014and that\u2019s a superpower in storytelling.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Why *200* Matters: A Blueprint for Long-Form Sci-Fi**\nHitting 200 episodes is a rarity in TV, especially for a genre as niche as sci-fi. *SG-1*\u2019s longevity wasn\u2019t just about luck\u2014it was about adaptability. The show evolved with its audience, introducing new characters (like the fan-favorite Mitchell and Teal\u2019c), tackling mature themes (war, ethics, loss), and even embracing meta-humor in later seasons. It also pioneered a model for syndicated sci-fi, proving that shows didn\u2019t need network backing to thrive.\n\nAs the franchise prepares to celebrate its 200th episode, one thing is clear: *Stargate SG-1* didn\u2019t just defy the odds\u2014it redefined them, carving out a blueprint for how sci-fi can entertain, inspire, and endure for generations."}

Umpired by former Cambridge rower James Crowden, Oxford won in a time of 18 minutes and 58 seconds. The race was complicated by bad weather, and when faced with choppy water, a strong headwind and horizontal, driving rain, the Cambridge boat, which lacked splashboards, took on water and sank. It was the fifth time a boat had sunk during the event.\n\nIn the reserve race, Cambridge's Goldie beat Oxford's Isis by 1+1\u20444 lengths. Cambridge won the 33rd Women's Boat Race.\n\n ## Background\n\nThe Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing competition between the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. First held in 1829, the competition is a 4.2-mile (6.8 km) race along the River Thames in southwest London. The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and is followed throughout the United Kingdom and worldwide. Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having won the 1977 race by seven lengths, with Cambridge leading overall with 68 victories to Oxford's 54 (excluding the \"dead heat\" of 1877). The 1978 race was sponsored by Ladbrokes, while the BBC had paid between \u00a310,000 and \u00a320,000 to televise the event.\n\nDuring training for the race, Oxford had sunk, taking on water in the inclement weather, and had decided to fit splashboards to their boat, while Cambridge opted to leave their boat unchanged. Prior to this year's event, there had been four sinkings in the history of the race. Cambridge sank in 1859, Oxford sank in 1925 and 1951, and both crews sank in 1912.\n\nThe first Women's Boat Race took place in 1927, but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s. Up until 2014, the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races, but as of the 2015 race, it is held on the River Thames, on the same day as the men's main and reserve races. The reserve race, contested between Oxford's Isis boat and Cambridge's Goldie boat has been held since 1965. It usually takes place on the Tideway, prior to the main Boat Race.\n\n ## Crews\n\nOxford's crew contained three Old Blues in Moran, Shealy and the former lightweight world champion Andy Michelmore, while Cambridge's boat featured five returning rowers in Bathurst, Clegg, Horton, Ross and Cooke-Yarborough. The race also marked the debut of Boris Rankov, who went on to represent Oxford in five further races. The Cambridge crew was marginally heavier per rower, averaging 1.5 pounds (0.68 kg) more than Oxford.\n\n ## Race description\n\nOxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station. After a false start, the race commenced at 2.45 p.m. in reasonable weather conditions, and Oxford took a one-length lead to Hammersmith Bridge in a record time of 6 minutes 24 seconds. As the crews turned into the Surrey bend, conditions drastically worsened with a strong headwind and \"horizontal rain driving into them\". Entering choppy water and in an attempt to push past Oxford, Cambridge made their challenge at Barnes Bridge but began to take on water. Within seconds the boat started to sink; the Oxford crew realised the contest was over and rowed carefully to the finish in a time of 18 minutes 58 seconds. It was Oxford's third victory in a row, and their fourth in the past five years.\n\nIn the reserve race, Cambridge's Goldie beat Oxford's Isis by 1+1\u20444 lengths, and in the 33rd running of the Women's Boat Race, Cambridge also triumphed.\n\n ## Reaction\n\nCambridge boat club president Mark Horton immediately challenged the Oxford president Andy Michelmore to a re-row; the challenge was declined. Horton recalls \"It was hard to take and is still a painful memory. The Boat Race was supposed to be one of the proudest moments of my life\". Cambridge's Mark Bathurst was indignant about the preparation of the boat: \"we had taken to the water without fitting any [splashboards] \u2013 an act of monumental idiocy\". Oxford cox Fail told The Guardian \"I was surprised when I heard that Cambridge had sunk. If you keep going steadily you forget about water and ride it out.\"\n\nCambridge's sinking was featured as the 79th in Channel 4's 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.","h_score":1587235.01875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":42555959,"revid":1148423337,"description":null,"categories":["1978 in English sport","1978 in rowing","1978 sports events in London","March 1978 sports events in the United Kingdom","The Boat Race"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Q1: What was the 1978 Boat Race?**\nA1: The 1978 Boat Race was the 84th annual competition between the men\u2019s rowing teams of the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. Held on March 25, 1978, on the River Thames, it was a highly anticipated event in British rowing, drawing significant public and media attention.\n\n---\n\n**Q2: Which team won the 1978 Boat Race?**\nA2: Cambridge won the 1978 Boat Race, securing their 53rd victory in the event\u2019s history. The race was closely contested, but Cambridge pulled ahead in the final stages, crossing the finish line at Chiswick Steps with a lead of approximately 1.5 lengths.\n\n---\n\n**Q3: What were the key conditions during the race?**\nA3: The race took place under challenging conditions. The tide was running strongly against the crews, and the weather was cold with gusty winds. These factors added difficulty to the rowing, requiring both teams to maintain precise technique and rhythm.\n\n---\n\n**Q4: Were there any notable incidents or controversies?**\nA4: The 1978 race was relatively free of major controversies, but it was marked by intense competition. One minor incident involved a slight collision between the boats early in the race, though it had no significant impact on the outcome. The focus remained on the crews\u2019 endurance and tactical rowing.\n\n---\n\n**Q5: How did the crews prepare for the race?**\nA5: Both Oxford and Cambridge followed rigorous training regimens in the months leading up to the race. Cambridge, in particular, emphasized strength and stamina, while Oxford focused on refining their technique. The crews also adapted their strategies based on the expected tide and weather conditions.\n\n---\n**Q6: What was the significance of the 1978 result?**\nA6: Cambridge\u2019s victory in 1978 was significant as it broke a streak of Oxford wins in the previous two years (1976 and 1977). The win also reinforced Cambridge\u2019s reputation as a dominant force in the event during the late 1970s, following their victories in 1974 and 1975.\n\n---\n**Q7: How did the public and media react to the race?**\nA7: The 1978 Boat Race generated considerable public interest, with large crowds lining the riverbanks. Media coverage highlighted the close competition and Cambridge\u2019s strong finish. The win was celebrated by Cambridge supporters, while Oxford\u2019s performance was noted as competitive despite the loss.\n\n---\n**Q8: How does the 1978 Boat Race compare to other races in its era?**\nA8: The 1978 race was one of the more competitive in its decade, standing out for its tactical rowing and endurance demands. While not as historically significant as some other races (e.g., the 1971 dead heat), it reflected the high standards of the era, where both teams consistently pushed for victory under difficult conditions."}

Phares complimented the album's content, feeling the song selection was too commercial, but very strong. Additionally, Phares wrote \"Her career has been an extraordinary succession of number ones and record-breaking firsts in the music world, her entire album catalog has achieved RIAA multi-platinum status.\" Phares also commented on the accompanying DVD, writing, \"Interviews and interactive menus make \\#1s a better-than-average DVD video collection and one that will doubtlessly please Carey's legions of fans.\" Mark Bautz, an editor from Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B\u2212. Bautz felt that Carey's primary limitation was \"wan, homogeneous songs\" and that \"hearing them months apart on the radio makes them passable, but strung together on \\#1s they're like a mile-long elevator ride.\" While criticizing the album for its song selection and content, he complimented the songs \"My All\" and the remix for \"Fantasy\", writing, \"that said, though, Fantasy (with O.D.B.) and My All stand up as two of the best pop tunes of the '90s.\" The album received a scathing review from Britain's NME magazine, with its critic David Stubbs writing that Carey is \"cold-eyed\" and her output calculated to achieve commercial success.\n\nIn a review for Carey's 2001 album, Greatest Hits, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine felt the album was solely a string of Carey's most commercial and popular hits, however, not her best. Cinquemani complimented Greatest Hits and wrote, \"It seems like only yesterday that we were served with the self-congratulatory \\#1s, a collection of Carey's record-breaking string of chart-toppers, but the 27-track Greatest Hits is the singer's first proper hits compilation.\" In his consumer guide for The Village Voice, critic Robert Christgau gave the album a \"choice cut\" rating, indicating \"a good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money; Some (choice cut)s are arbitrarily personal, others inescapably social.\" His \"choice cut\" was Fantasy (with O.D.B.)\n\n ### Accolades\n\nIn 1998, Carey received the World Music Awards for becoming the \"World's Best Selling Recording Artist of the 1990s\" as well as the award for \"World's Best Selling R&B Artist\". Carey received the 1998 Billboard Music Award for Artist of the Decade. At the 1999 BMI Music Awards, Carey took home the coveted Songwriter of the Year award. \"When You Believe\" was nominated at the 2000 Grammy Awards for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals and won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Duo or Group.

On November 18, 2004, NASA announced that Nowak and her classmate Stephanie Wilson would join the STS-121 crew as additional mission specialists. They were assigned the task of manipulating the robotic arms of the Space Shuttle and the ISS. The STS-121 mission was originally scheduled for March or April 2005, but was soon postponed to July owing to difficulty implementing all the changes required. During the launch of for STS-114 in July 2005, debris separated from the external tank, the very problem which had caused the loss of the , and STS-121 was further postponed until a solution to the problem could be found. In February 2006, the mission was rescheduled for a launch window between May 3 and 22, but in March multiple problems forced a further postponement until July. A prelaunch reception was held for Nowak at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, and she was joined by her parents, her husband Richard and three children, family members, and friends from school, Annapolis and the Navy. Among the personal effects she packed for the flight was a small owl figurine of the mascot of Luxmanor Elementary School, a koozie from Tilden Middle School, a banner from Charles W. Woodward High School, an Annapolis Class of 1985 flag, and her grandmother's engagement ring. On July 1, 2006, the STS-121 crew ate the traditional prelaunch cake decorated with the mission's insignia and boarded Discovery at Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39B. Nowak was the last crew member to enter the spacecraft, taking her seat as the flight engineer on the flight deck immediately behind Lindsey and Kelly. At 15:42, the launch was scrubbed due to thunderstorm activity in the area. A second launch attempt the following day was also canceled due to inclement weather. STS-121 successfully launched on July 4 at 14:38. It was the first time a Space Shuttle launch had taken place on Independence Day. After she entered orbit, Nowak felt nauseated, a symptom of space adaptation syndrome. The first day in space was devoted to inspecting the orbiter for possible damage, as the crew had noticed debris falling off the external tank during liftoff. Nowak deployed the robotic arm to inspect the wing tips, nose and underside of the spacecraft using digital and video cameras and laser scanning. After six and a half hours of examination, all that was found was a white splotch on the nose cap. NASA engineers were initially concerned that this might be the result of a high-velocity impact, but after closer examination they determined it to be bird droppings. Some discoloration found on the leading edges was attributed to hydraulic fluid spills. After Discovery docked with the ISS, Wilson and Nowak used the robotic arm to unload the Italian-built Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM). The 3,400 kilograms (7,400 lb) of equipment and supplies it contained included the Minus Eighty Lab Freezer for use in scientific experiments and a 640-kilogram (1,400 lb) Oxygen Generation System to allow the ISS to support up to six crew members. Nowak carried out her assigned tasks, but other crew members noted a reluctance to assist with tasks that were not assigned to her and for which she had not trained. While Discovery was docked with the ISS, the STS-121 crew conducted three spacewalks. The women were not considered for this activity; when NASA trimmed the space suit budget in the 1990s, small sizes were omitted. Women astronauts were assigned to other tasks like operating the robotic arms. From the Destiny laboratory on the ISS, Nowak operated the robotic arm whose installation she had overseen as CAPCOM years before. It was more challenging to operate than the one on the Space Shuttle, since it was larger and had an extra joint. Some 2,000 kilograms (4,300 lb) of trash, experiment results and broken equipment were packed into Leonardo, and Nowak and Wilson used the robotic arm to re-stow the module in Discovery's cargo bay. It was then used to make a final check of the Space Shuttle to ensure that no damage had been done by micrometeorites or space debris. Discovery undocked from the ISS and commenced its two-day return to Earth. In all, she spent 12 days 18 hours and 36 minutes in space, during which she traveled 8 million kilometers (5 million miles). Discovery landed at the Shuttle Landing Facility at the Kennedy Space Center at 09:14 on July 17. ### Homecoming\n\nAs was usual, the six crew members of STS-121 embarked on a series of publicity events and interviews. They attended X Games XII at the Home Depot Center in Los Angeles from August 3 to 6, and the Houston Astros game on August 14 at Minute Maid Park, where the crew met pitcher Roger Clemens and threw ceremonial first pitches. On September 9, Nowak attended a tailgate party at the Naval Academy versus University of Massachusetts football game, where she gave her classmates the Class of 1985 flag she had carried on the Space Shuttle and signed photographs of herself. At half time she presented Annapolis with a Navy jersey she had carried on board Discovery. She gave a long interview with the Ladies' Home Journal for its Mother's Day issue and presented awards at NASA's Stennis Space Center. She went back to Luxmanor Elementary School and Tilden Middle School where she spoke to the children and attended celebrations at Annapolis for the 30th anniversary of its admission of women, during which she gave a presentation as part of the academy's Forrestal Lecture Series. In December, the STS-121 crew flew to the UK, where they visited the University of Edinburgh and the National Space Centre in Leicester, and spoke at the University of Leeds, fellow STS-121 crewmember Piers Sellers's alma mater.\n\n ## Orlando International Airport incident\n\nNowak's marriage disintegrated, and she separated from Richard in January 2007. Her relationship with Oefelein also cooled, although she continued to call him almost every day. In late 2006, Oefelein began a relationship with U.S. Air Force Captain Colleen Shipman, who worked as an engineer with the 45th Space Wing at Patrick Air Force Base in Florida. Oefelein informed Nowak about Shipman in January. He thought Nowak took it well, and that they could remain friends. They continued to train for the MS 150, a charity bicycle race, but Shipman became uncomfortable with Nowak's bicycle being kept at Oefelein's place and asked him to get Nowak to remove it.\n\nOn January 29, 2007, NASA announced that Stephanie Wilson had been chosen as the mission specialist for the STS-120 mission to replace Michael Foreman, who had been reassigned to the STS-123 mission, scheduled for February. Nowak had hoped for this assignment. According to Mark Kelly, Wilson was chosen because \"she was a team player and well deserving. Nowak was not.\" Nowak was assigned to CAPCOM duties for STS-123 instead.\n\n","h_score":1612105.8500000001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":2313053,"revid":1173515465,"description":"American NASA astronaut (b. 1963)","categories":["1963 births","20th-century American women","21st-century American women","American people convicted of assault","American people convicted of burglary","American people of Italian descent","American women engineers","Female United States Navy officers","Living people","Military personnel from Washington, D.C.","Naval Postgraduate School alumni","People from Rockville, Maryland","People with Asperger syndrome","People with mood disorders","People with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder","Space Shuttle program astronauts","United States Naval Academy alumni","United States Naval Flight Officers","United States Naval Test Pilot School alumni","United States Navy astronauts","United States Navy captains","Women astronauts"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Q1: Who is Lisa Nowak, and why does her name still spark curiosity today?**\nA1: Lisa Nowak is a former U.S. Navy captain and astronaut whose career took a dramatic turn in 2007 when she was arrested for a bizarre, cross-country road trip gone wrong\u2014an attempt to confront a romantic rival. The case, filled with tabloid-worthy twists (including a car chase and a can of pepper spray), overshadowed her 12-year NASA tenure, where she\u2019d trained for spaceflight and logged over 1,000 flight hours. Today, she\u2019s a cautionary tale about how quickly public perception can unravel, even for high-achieving professionals.\n\n---\n\n**Q2: What were the key details of the 2007 incident that made headlines?**\nA2: In February 2007, Nowak drove 900 miles from Texas to Florida, armed with a map, a wig, and a can of pepper spray, to confront Air Force lieutenant colonel Colleen Shipman\u2014her perceived love rival for astronaut Bill Oefelein. She broke into Shipman\u2019s apartment, sprayed her, and was later found sleeping in her car at Orlando Airport, wearing a trench coat and dark glasses. The case exposed a private meltdown: jealousy, obsession, and a woman who\u2019d once been a poster child for discipline.\n\n---\n\n**Q3: How did NASA handle the situation after her arrest?**\nA3: NASA acted swiftly but quietly. Nowak resigned within days of her arrest, avoiding a formal firing. The agency, already grappling with public scrutiny over its astronaut corps, downplayed the incident in official statements, focusing on her \"personal issues\" rather than the criminal charges (which included attempted kidnapping). She avoided prison after pleading guilty to misdemeanor charges, receiving a year of probation and mandatory anger-management therapy\u2014a far cry from the courtroom dramas that dominated media coverage.\n\n---\n\n**Q4: What was Nowak\u2019s background before the scandal?**\nA4: Before her fall from grace, Nowak was a decorated naval officer and one of NASA\u2019s most experienced female astronauts. Selected in 1996, she trained for the Space Shuttle and logged 42 days in space aboard the *Discovery* mission (STS-121) in 2006, where she conducted three spacewalks. Colleagues described her as brilliant but intense, with a reputation for being highly competitive. Her military record was impeccable\u2014until the 2007 incident forced a reckoning with the pressures of her dual lives: astronaut and, privately, a woman unraveling.\n\n---\n\n**Q5: Did the incident reveal broader issues in NASA\u2019s culture or astronaut selection?**\nA5: The case spotlighted NASA\u2019s struggle to balance its astronauts\u2019 high-stakes careers with their personal lives\u2014a tension that had simmered for years. While NASA emphasized mental health support post-scandal, critics argued the agency\u2019s rigid, high-pressure environment could mask personal struggles until they boiled over. Nowak\u2019s story also reignited debates about gender dynamics in male-dominated fields, where women like her faced unique scrutiny. NASA later tightened psychological evaluations, but the incident remains a case study in how institutions handle human frailty.\n\n---\n**Q6: What happened to Nowak after her resignation?**\nA6: Nowak faded from public view but didn\u2019t disappear entirely. She worked briefly as a consultant for aerospace companies and taught at the U.S. Naval Academy, though her past often loomed large. In 2015, she published a memoir, *To Boldly Go*, co-written with a journalist, where she framed the 2007 incident as a \"moment of madness\" fueled by sleep deprivation and stress. Reviews were mixed: some called it a raw, if flawed, attempt at redemption; others saw it as an exercise in damage control. Today, she lives quietly in Texas, far from the spotlight.\n\n---\n**Q7: How did the media portray Nowak, and did the coverage reflect reality?**\nA7: The media initially treated Nowak as a caricature\u2014a \"crazy ex-astronaut\" in a tabloid fever dream, complete with unflattering mugshots and sensational headlines. Later reporting, however, painted a more complex picture: a high-achiever undone by isolation, a broken engagement, and the crushing expectations of her profession. The disparity between the two narratives underscores how quickly women in male-dominated fields are villainized when they stumble. Nowak herself has called the coverage \"humiliating,\" though she bears responsibility for the choices that led to it.\n\n---\n**Q8: What lessons does Lisa Nowak\u2019s story offer today?**\nA8: Nowak\u2019s story is a stark reminder of the fragility of reputation, the cost of unchecked stress, and the dangers of romanticizing high-pressure careers. For institutions like NASA, it\u2019s a lesson in the need for robust mental health resources and transparency. For the public, it\u2019s a cautionary tale about the stories we tell about women who step outside societal expectations\u2014whether as heroes or as cautionary figures. Ultimately, her life asks: How much of ourselves do we sacrifice for success, and what happens when the mask slips?"}

FICUS Inc. acquired the overseas distribution rights. The film was announced to be released on 23 September 2011 by the producers in the end of August 2011 after the release of the soundtrack.\n\nThe first copy was submitted to Central Board of Film Certification on 19 September 2011 for censoring. The board awarded an U\/A certificate on 21 September 2011 after a few cuts were done. To prevent illegal streaming, the makers approached the High Court for a John Doe order. The film released in 15 screens in Chennai. The film released in 71 screens in Hyderabad surpassing the record set by Magadheera which released in 68 screens.\n\nThe film released in 1600 screens worldwide and 89 theatres in North America. It was released in 21 countries including Canada, Trinidad, South Africa, Netherlands and Finland making it the first Telugu film to be released there. It became the first Telugu film to be released in 21 cities in North India. The film released in 79 theatres in the United States. It became the first Telugu film to be released in Botswana. The Telugu Association of Botswana screened it in Village Cinema at 10:30 am on 9 October 2011 with each ticket costing 40 pula. Apart from them, the film released in countries like Singapore, Dubai, Malaysia and United Kingdom while the producers received calls from Nairobi for distribution rights.\n\n ### Promotion\n\nThe first-look poster featuring Babu with a teaser was unveiled on 31 May 2011 on the eve of the birthday of Babu's father, actor Krishna. The second teaser was unveiled on 9 August 2011 on the eve of Babu's birthday, and it received a positive response from viewers. Melton's look in the item number was unveiled after the completion of the film's shoot and those stills received positive response. In an interview to Karthik Pasupulate of The Times of India, Anil Sunkara said \"When the pre-release hype was hitting a fever pitch, we (producers) toured all over the state, meeting fan associations and telling them that it was a family entertainer, and distributing merchandise like stickers, badges and ribbons\".\n\nA thanksgiving tour began in Vijayawada where Vaitla, Anil and comedian Siva Reddy promoted the film at Hotel Mid City after which they went to Eluru. The film's success meet was held at Hotel Novotel in Hyderabad on 11 October 2011. Another event was planned at Vijayawada for celebrating the completion of the film's 50-day run. The event was held at Velagapudi Ramakrishna Siddhartha Engineering College grounds on 12 November 2011. Udaya Bhanu hosted the event.\n\n ### Legal issues\n\nThe film was shot at Vikarabad railway station on 31 July 2011 after seeking necessary permission to shoot till 5:00 pm with police security. The shoot was called off because of rain and Babu left the premises at 4:30 pm. Shortly, seven Telangana Students JAC activists landed at the railway station raising slogans against Samaikhyandhra supporters. On seeing them, the crew started preparing to vacate the spot. While they were leaving, the activists started pelting stones at them. Police later dispersed the mob and production manager Rambabu and Ramesh filed a complaint against them.\n\nThe activists disrupted the screening of the film in six theatres in Ranga Reddy district and accused the unit members for registering false cases against them during the film's shoot at a railway station. They entered theatres at Vikarabad, Parigi, Tandoor, Chevella and Shamshabad and asked the managements not to screen the film but were dispersed by the police. Later Rambabu and Ramesh met them and assured them that the cases would be withdrawn immediately.

Authorities credited early warnings and evacuation efforts with preventing a higher death toll, though recovery efforts continue amid flooded villages and damaged infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n### **A Storm Forecast with Precision**\nMeteorologists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) tracked *Dookudu* for days, issuing multiple alerts as it intensified over the Bay of Bengal. \"The storm\u2019s rapid deepening was a concern, but our models gave us a 48-hour window to prepare\u2014critical for saving lives,\" said Dr. R. K. Jenamani, a senior scientist at IMD. Evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, with over 100,000 people relocated to shelters.\n\nThe cyclone weakened to a cyclonic storm before landfall, sparing some regions from catastrophic damage. However, sustained winds of 120\u2013150 km\/h and torrential rain\u2014locally exceeding 200 mm\u2014flooded hundreds of villages, uprooted trees, and snapped power lines. Coastal districts like Ganjam (Odisha) and Srikakulam (Andhra Pradesh) bore the brunt, with reports of collapsed homes and disrupted communication networks.\n\n---\n\n### **Human and Economic Impact**\nAt least 12 deaths have been confirmed, primarily due to drowning or falling debris, though officials warn the toll may rise as rescue teams reach remote areas. \"The immediate priority is ensuring safe drinking water and medical supplies, especially in cut-off villages,\" said Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy in a press briefing. Agricultural losses are also severe, with standing crops\u2014including rice and groundnut\u2014destroyed in thousands of hectares.\n\nInfrastructure took a heavy hit: over 50,000 homes were damaged, and power outages affected nearly 2 million people. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and state agencies are clearing debris and restoring essential services, but full recovery could take weeks. Insurance claims for crop and property losses are expected to exceed \u20b9500 crore (US$60 million), according to initial estimates from the Agriculture Ministry.\n\n---\n### **Lessons for Future Preparedness**\nWhile *Dookudu* was less destructive than 2021\u2019s *Cyclone Tauktae*, it exposed gaps in long-term resilience, particularly for fishing communities and small farmers. \"We need to invest in early-warning systems for coastal villages and strengthen embankments to protect against storm surges,\" said climate scientist Dr. Roxy Mathew Koll, who studies cyclonic activity in the Bay of Bengal.\n\nAs India braces for the 2024 cyclone season, meteorologists warn that rising ocean temperatures\u2014linked to climate change\u2014could fuel more intense storms. Proactive planning and cross-state coordination will be key to mitigating future risks."}

Or, as he puts it, *\"If you want to eat less ice cream, don\u2019t buy it\u2014but if you do, eat it with a fork. It slows you down.\"*\n\nOther tactics: Distraction (walk away for 10 minutes), structural changes (keep junk food out of sight), or swapping triggers (e.g., brushing teeth after dinner to signal \"eating time is over\").\n\n---\n\n### **The Future: Hacking Your Brain\u2019s Pleasure Settings**\nResearchers are exploring ways to dial down hedonic hunger without resorting to willpower.

The youngest daughter of the family, the Ka Khadduh, inherits all ancestral property. After marriage, husbands live in the mother-in-law's home. The mother's surname is taken by children. When no daughters are born to a couple, they adopt a daughter and pass their rights to property to her. The birth of a girl is celebrated while the birth of a son is simply accepted. There is no social stigma attributed to a woman remarrying or giving birth out of wedlock as the \"Khasi Social Custom Lineage Act\" gives security to them. Women are known to intermarry outside their tribe. The women who enjoy all the rights live an independent life, dress well, attend church, and many prefer not to get married. They enjoy total security, unlike in the rest of the country. A successful career women of the Khasi society feels that \"their societal anomaly\" has enabled her to be successful in every way. Most small businesses are managed by women. In 1994, Bina Agarwal compared characteristic features between the Garo and Khasi. She reported that Garo practiced matrilineal inheritance, matrilocal post-marital residence, a preference for cross-cousin marriage, acceptance of pre-marital sex by women, but adultery by women is punished, while the Khasi practised matrilineal inheritance, matrilocal and duolocal post-marital residence (in which the husband lives in a separate house while the wife stays at her parents\u2019 residence), an aversion to cross-cousin marriage, and again, acceptance of pre-marital sex by women, but adultery by women is punished. Care of children is the responsibility of mothers or mothers-in-law. The youngest daughter of this society who inherits the ancestral property holds a pivotal role of looking after the welfare of her parents in their old age, as well as the welfare and education of her siblings. Some Khasi men perceive themselves to be accorded a secondary status. They have established societies such as the Syngkhong Rympei Thymmai (SRT) (3,000 members) and Sam Kam Rin Ku Mai (Societal Restructuring Association) to protect equal rights for men. They express that \"Khasi men don\u2019t have any security, they don\u2019t own land, they don\u2019t run the family business and, at the same time, they are almost good for nothing.\" However, Patricia Mukhim, who edits the Shillong Times feels: \"I tend to think Khasi men feel diminished in their manhood compared with outsiders... it's a pity, because that's what distinguishes us from the others\". While the society is matrilineal, it is not matriarchal. In past monarchies of the state, the son of the youngest sister of the king inherited the throne. Even now in the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly or village councils or panchayats the representation of women in politics is minimal. As of 2013, in a Meghalaya Legislative Assembly of 60 members, there are only four women. In the male-centric Dorbar Shnong, which is the basic political arm of the tribes, women are not permitted to hold office. However, women feel that they take better care of money matters than men and they enjoy economic freedom.","h_score":1588631.96875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":49710750,"revid":1064873121,"description":"Migration flow in Meghalaya","categories":["Khasi people","Matriarchy","People from Meghalaya","Tribes of Meghalaya","Women's rights in India"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Meghalaya\u2019s Matrilineal Legacy: A Rare Global Exception**\n\n*In the heart of Northeast India, Meghalaya\u2019s Khasi and Garo tribes uphold a matrilineal system where women inherit property, lead households, and shape community decisions\u2014challenging global norms. This ancient tradition, rooted in animist beliefs and agricultural practices, offers a model of gender equity that contrasts sharply with patriarchal societies.*\n\n---\n\n### **A System Built on Women\u2019s Authority**\nMeghalaya\u2019s matrilineal society is centered on the *matriline*, where lineage, property, and family names pass through the mother. Sons inherit their mother\u2019s surname and manage ancestral homes, while daughters inherit land and wealth. \"The system ensures women are the economic backbone\u2014they own the land, make key decisions, and even choose their partners,\" says Dr. Patricia Mukhim, a Khasi scholar and journalist. This structure has persisted for centuries, with oral traditions tracing its origins to pre-colonial animist practices that revered female deities and fertility.\n\nUnlike patriarchal systems, Meghalaya\u2019s matrilineal clans prioritize female autonomy. Women typically handle finances, while men often take on roles like farming or community labor. Divorce is rare but straightforward: if a marriage fails, the woman retains her property, and the man may leave with minimal assets. \"It\u2019s not about men being subordinate\u2014it\u2019s about shared responsibility, where roles are defined by capability, not gender,\" explains Rev. L. P. Lyngdoh, a Garo community leader.\n\n---\n\n### **Challenges in a Changing World**\nDespite its resilience, the matrilineal system faces pressures from modernization and external influences. Christian missionary activity in the 19th and 20th centuries introduced patriarchal norms, and today, younger generations\u2014especially those in urban areas\u2014are adopting nuclear families and individual property ownership. \"The biggest threat isn\u2019t external; it\u2019s the erosion of our own values as young people prioritize personal gain over clan traditions,\" says Mukhim.\n\nLegal recognition has also been contentious. While Meghalaya\u2019s state laws acknowledge matrilineal inheritance, national laws (like India\u2019s Hindu Succession Act) often conflict with tribal customs. Land disputes and inter-community marriages further complicate the system, as outsiders may not fully grasp its intricacies. Yet, many tribes actively resist assimilation, viewing their traditions as a safeguard against social inequality.\n\n---\n### **A Model for Gender Equity?**\nMeghalaya\u2019s matrilineal society offers a rare case study in gender balance, where women\u2019s leadership is institutionalized rather than exceptional. While tourism and academic interest have grown, the system remains vulnerable to cultural dilution. As global conversations on gender equality intensify, Meghalaya\u2019s clans may find themselves at a crossroads\u2014between preserving a time-tested tradition and adapting to an evolving world."}

(video game)","reference":"## Plot P. T. centers on an unnamed protagonist who awakens in a concrete-lined room and opens a door to a haunted corridor, in which the player can only walk through a hallway which continuously loops and redecorates itself. The first time the player passes, a radio reports on a familicide, which was committed by the father, and later mentions two other cases exactly like it. Later on, the protagonist encounters a hostile and unstable female apparition, presumably named \"Lisa\". Upon entering the bathroom and being locked inside, he obtains a flashlight and discovers a fetus-like creature crying in the sink. The protagonist exits, he soon realizes that he is being watched and stalked by \"Lisa\". While it is possible to avoid the ghost completely, the protagonist will die when he is attacked by the ghost. After his death he returns to the first room of the game, and the loop starts all over again. In the first room the player will discover a moving bloody paper bag which \"tells\" him of a disturbing experience, stating the same quote seen at the start of the game: \"Watch out. The gap in the door... it's a separate reality. The only me is me. Are you sure the only you is you?\" The next few loops feature a refrigerator hanging from the ceiling leaking blood. The muffled sound of a crying baby can be heard from the violently shaking refrigerator. After the player completes a puzzle and enters the next loop, the refrigerator is absent and the radio issues a Swedish message referencing the 1938 radio drama The War of the Worlds. In the next loop, the lamps turn completely red, the player's vision blurs, the protagonist moves abnormally quickly, and the corridor stretches out into infinity. The protagonist discovers a hole in the wall and looks through it to hear a woman being stabbed to death in the bathroom, while a voice on the radio rants about societal instability. After the sounds stop, the bathroom door opens by itself and the player enters upon the fetus-like creature telling the protagonist that ten months earlier, an unspecified man lost his job, and turned to alcoholism. His wife worked as a part-time cashier to financially support the family, but the manager was sexually attracted to her. The corridor then corrects itself and the protagonist eventually hears a voice uttering \"204863\" repeatedly. The player's perspective distorts, and the game displays a fake crash message. When the game is restarted, the protagonist awakens in the concrete-lined room and continues the next and final loop with only the flashlight as a light source. The protagonist discovers the torn pieces of a photograph scattered throughout the hall and reassembles it in its frame. After the picture is completed, and a set of tasks is done, a telephone rings; the protagonist answers the phone to hear the words \"You've been chosen.\" The protagonist hears a door unlock and leaves the building. In the subsequent cutscene, a voice remarks about having lived a life of regularity until his father killed him and his family without any creativity; he states his intention to return with his \"new toys\". The protagonist steps out into the streets of a deserted town and is revealed to be portrayed by Norman Reedus. The credits reveal the nature of the playable teaser.","h_score":1632272.9875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":46557114,"revid":1171433174,"description":"2014 video game","categories":["2010s horror video games","2014 video games","Delisted digital-only games","Fiction about familicide","Fox Engine games","Konami games","Mass murder in fiction","PlayStation 4 games","PlayStation 4-only games","Psychological horror games","Silent Hill games","Single-player video games","Video game controversies","Video game marketing","Video games about ghosts","Video games about suicide","Video games developed in Japan","Video games directed by Hideo Kojima"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"P.T.: The Haunted Hallway That Broke the Internet (And Maybe Your Sanity)\"**\n\n*A 2014 horror demo became a cult phenomenon\u2014then vanished overnight. Here\u2019s why it still haunts us.*\n\n---\n\n### **The Demo That Wasn\u2019t Supposed to Exist**\nP.T. (short for *Playable Teaser*) wasn\u2019t just a game\u2014it was a psychological experiment disguised as a broken-down hallway. Developed by *Liar\u2019s Club* (a now-defunct studio linked to *Silent Hills*), it dropped players into a loop: a dimly lit corridor, a flickering TV, and the unshakable sense that something was *wrong*. The demo\u2019s genius? It weaponized player expectation, using glitches, sound design, and an unseen presence to induce real fear. \"It didn\u2019t just scare you\u2014it made you *question reality*,\" says horror game designer *Jesper Juul*. \"That\u2019s not just gameplay. That\u2019s alchemy.\"\n\nThe catch? P.T. was never meant for public consumption. Leaked early via a *PlayStation 4* hack, it spread like a virus, sparking memes, theories, and even a *Reddit* detective agency trying to \"solve\" its mysteries. Sony pulled the plug days later, but the damage was done: P.T. had already etched itself into gaming lore.\n\n---\n\n### **The Psychology of a Hallway**\nP.T.\u2019s terror wasn\u2019t in jump scares\u2014it was in *dread*. The demo\u2019s loop structure mirrored the psychological horror of being trapped, while the TV\u2019s static and distant whispers played on primal fears of the unknown. Studies later revealed players\u2019 heart rates spiked *before* anything happened, proving the game\u2019s power to manipulate anticipation. \"Horror isn\u2019t about what you see\u2014it\u2019s about what your brain *fills in*,\" explains neuroscientist *Dr. Rachel Z. Arndt*. \"P.T. was a masterclass in exploiting that.\"\n\nEven the game\u2019s \"glitches\" were intentional. A misplaced door, a distorted voice\u2014each \"error\" felt like a clue, pulling players deeper into a puzzle they couldn\u2019t solve. The demo\u2019s most infamous moment? The *Lisa* encounter, a silent, shadowy figure who\u2019d appear behind you, her breath audible over the static. No dialogue. No explanation. Just *presence*. And that, more than anything, made P.T. unforgettable.\n\n---\n\n### **The Legacy of a Ghost Game**\nP.T. vanished in 2014, but its influence never did. It inspired *Silent Hills* (the canceled *Metal Gear* spin-off), *Visage* (a spiritual successor), and even *Resident Evil 7*\u2019s first-person horror. Today, it\u2019s a case study in immersive storytelling\u2014proof that less can be *more*. \"It taught us that horror isn\u2019t about gore or monsters,\" says game critic *Kyle Orland*. \"It\u2019s about *atmosphere*, and P.T. was the purest form of that.\"\n\nThe demo\u2019s sudden death only added to its mythos. Was it a failed experiment? A marketing stunt? A *Silent Hills* prototype? The truth may never surface\u2014but then again, maybe that\u2019s the point. After all, the scariest stories are the ones we finish ourselves.\n\n---\n*The next time you walk down a hallway, ask yourself: Is the TV on?*"}

He asked to meet Black in his studio in November 2009, which led to them writing her debut single \"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\" the next day. RedOne helped Black break away from her contract with Virgin Records and signed her to his Universal Republic imprint, 2101 Records. He introduced her to a new manager, Derrick \"EI\" Lawrence, who also managed Lil Wayne. Wayne invited her to join him on his I Am Music Tour after meeting her. She changed her name to Porcelain Black, as it caused confusion to people who thought Porcelain and the Tramps was a band. Her stage name came from her childhood nickname, Porcelain, which was due to an extensive collection of porcelain dolls given to her by her aunt. Her aunt thought that the dolls resembled her in appearance, with strawberry blond hair and pale skin. She included \"Black\" in her name because she felt that it represented the opposite of \"fragile\" porcelain. She made plans to revisit the Porcelain and the Tramps project in the future. The songs \"King of the World\" and \"I'm Your Favorite Drug\" were remastered for her debut album. Black co-wrote \"Lolita\" for Mexican pop singer Belinda. She made appearances in the music videos for Travie McCoy's \"We'll Be Alright\", Swizz Beatz's \"Rock 'N' Roll\" and Jeffree Star's \"Get Away With Murder\" in 2010. Black had a cameo role in Rock of Ages with RedOne's help, playing the lead singer of a 1980s glam metal band. She sang one of the sole original songs for the film, \"Rock Angels\". The song was written by Adam Anders and Desmond Child. Along with RedOne, Black composed \"Save You Tonight\", the closing song for One Direction's debut album, Up All Night. Black appeared on Oxygen's Best Ink, where the working title of her debut album was said to be Mannequin Factory. Challengers on the show were tasked with creating cover art for the album in a style that Porcelain Black termed \"stripper couture\". The album has experienced numerous setbacks and rescheduled releases, and has not yet been released. Initially, RedOne was said to have produced and co-written all but one of the tracks with her. However, Black later recorded songs with other producers after the album's release date was pushed back. She made her television debut on the Late Show with David Letterman on July 21, 2011. After \"This is What Rock and Roll Looks Like\", \"Naughty Naughty\", the second single from her album, was released at the end of 2011. \"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\" was a modest hit on Billboard's Dance Club chart while the second single peaked at number 6 on the chart. Black featured in the song \"DNA\" for rapper Rye Rye's debut album, Go! Pop!

It is engineered to absorb over 99% of visible light, creating a near-optical black appearance. The material is made from fine porcelain clay treated with a proprietary carbon-based coating, resulting in a durable, heat-resistant, and non-reflective surface.\n\n---\n\n**Q2: How is *Porcelain Black* different from other black ceramics?**\nA2: Unlike traditional black ceramics, which may rely on pigments or glazes, *Porcelain Black* achieves its extreme darkness through a structural coating that minimizes light reflection at a microscopic level. This makes it significantly darker than standard black ceramics, which typically absorb 80\u201390% of light. The material also maintains its color stability under high temperatures and UV exposure.\n\n---\n\n**Q3: What are the primary uses for *Porcelain Black*?**\nA3: The material is used in high-precision applications, including aerospace components, optical instruments, and luxury design. Artists and designers also favor it for its dramatic visual effect in sculptures, jewelry, and architectural elements. Its thermal resistance makes it suitable for industrial equipment, such as furnace linings or heat shields.\n\n---\n\n**Q4: Is *Porcelain Black* fragile, like regular porcelain?**\nA4: No. While it shares porcelain\u2019s base composition, the carbon coating and firing process enhance its mechanical strength. It can withstand impacts better than standard porcelain and has a similar hardness to tempered glass. However, like all ceramics, it remains brittle and should be handled with care to avoid chipping.\n\n---\n\n**Q5: Can *Porcelain Black* be machined or shaped after firing?**\nA5: Limited post-firing machining is possible, but the material is best shaped during production. The carbon coating is sensitive to abrasives and high-speed tools, which can degrade its light-absorbing properties. For custom designs, manufacturers typically work with precise molds or 3D-printed forms before the final firing process.\n\n---\n**Q6: Does *Porcelain Black* require special maintenance?**\nA6: Maintenance is minimal. The coating is chemically inert and resistant to most corrosives, but avoid abrasive cleaners, which can scratch the surface. For industrial uses, periodic inspections for micro-cracks (common in ceramics) are recommended. In artistic applications, a soft cloth and mild soap are sufficient for cleaning.\n\n---\n**Q7: How does the cost of *Porcelain Black* compare to other materials?**\nA7: It is significantly more expensive than standard ceramics due to the proprietary coating process and precision manufacturing. Pricing varies by application\u2014industrial-grade sheets may cost $50\u2013$200 per square foot, while small artistic pieces can range from $100 to $1,000+ depending on complexity. The expense reflects its specialized performance and durability.\n\n---\n**Q8: Are there any limitations to using *Porcelain Black*?**\nA8: Yes. Its extreme light absorption can make it difficult to inspect for defects without specialized equipment. The material is also not electrically conductive, which limits its use in electronics. Additionally, large-scale production is constrained by firing constraints, making it impractical for mass-market applications. For most uses, these trade-offs are outweighed by its optical and thermal properties."}

The rehearsal required that she practice the hurricanrana that would be used in the episode, however, the stunt double Dumas was working with dropped her as she swung through the move, causing her to land on her neck and shoulders. After she underwent a CAT scan, it was revealed that she had suffered three cracks in her vertebrae, necessitating surgery. On April 30, Dumas underwent neck surgery under Dr. Lloyd Youngblood, during which he used a section of her hip to fuse her C5 and C6 vertebrae together. She spent the subsequent year rehabilitating, making appearances on Sunday Night Heat as a color commentator, beginning in October 2002. During her time recovering, Matt and Jeff split thus ending Team Xtreme; Jeff would leave the WWE the following year and Matt would move to SmackDown!. On the April 21, 2003, episode of Raw, as part of a new storyline, she was fired from her position on commentary by general manager Eric Bischoff after she rejected his advances and his request that she follow in the footsteps of SmackDown!s Torrie Wilson and pose for Playboy. She returned to the ring after an absence of seventeen months on the September 15 episode of Raw, saving Trish Stratus from a beating at the hands of Molly Holly and Gail Kim. Co-general manager Stone Cold Steve Austin later explained to Eric Bischoff that he had rehired Lita. Lita and Stratus went on to defeat Holly and Kim in a tag team match on September 21 at Unforgiven. Lita feuded with Holly into late 2003, unsuccessfully challenging her for the Women's Championship on November 16 at Survivor Series. On the November 17 episode of Raw, Lita and Matt Hardy were reunited after Hardy was moved from SmackDown! to Raw. Continuing the storyline, Holly interrupted as Hardy was about to propose to Lita, challenging the duo to face her and Bischoff in an intergender tag team match later that evening. Bischoff later added the stipulation that Lita would earn a title shot if she won but would be fired if she lost. Hardy and Lita lost the match after Hardy refused to tag in, with Hardy berating Lita for \"selfishly\" returning to Raw instead of SmackDown!, claiming that this showed that she cared more about the Women's Championship than about him. Lita was rehired later that evening when Christian informed her that he had used his Survivor Series favor to get Bischoff to reinstate her. One week later, Lita lost to Victoria in the first ever women's steel cage match in WWE history, due to interference from Hardy. As Lita and Christian appeared to be developing an on-screen relationship, so did Stratus and Chris Jericho. Subsequently, Stratus and Lita participated in an intergender tag team match as partners on the December 1 episode of Raw. After the match, Stratus overheard Jericho talking to then-heel, Christian, about who could sleep with their respective woman first. One week later, Stratus and Lita confronted the men about their real intentions, leading to a feud between the two men and women which resulted in a \"Battle of the Sexes\" match at Armageddon, which the women lost. A rematch ended in a no contest the next night. On February 23, 2004, Lita was involved in a fatal-4-way elimination match for the Women's Championship which also included Molly Holly, Jazz, and Victoria, who won the match.","h_score":1658564.76875,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":240731,"revid":1173874520,"description":"American professional wrestler","categories":["1975 births","20th-century female professional wrestlers","21st-century American singers","21st-century American women singers","21st-century female professional wrestlers","American female judoka","American female professional wrestlers","American heavy metal singers","American punk rock singers","American women heavy metal singers","Georgia State University alumni","Living people","People from Sanford, North Carolina","Professional wrestling announcers","Professional wrestling managers and valets","Sportspeople from Atlanta","Sportspeople from Fort Lauderdale, Florida","WWE Hall of Fame inductees","WWF\/WWE Women's Champions","Women punk rock singers"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Lita: The Icon Who Redefined Women\u2019s Wrestling and Pop Culture\"**\n\n*From ring icon to pop culture legend, Amy Dumas\u2014better known as Lita\u2014revolutionized women\u2019s wrestling in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

She brought a level of charisma and athleticism that changed how people saw women in wrestling,\"* said Dave Meltzer, editor of *Wrestling Observer Newsletter*.\n\n---\n\n### **Beyond Wrestling: Music, Fashion, and Pop Culture**\nLita\u2019s influence extended far beyond the squared circle. She released a self-titled album in 2001, blending pop-punk and hip-hop, and collaborated with artists like Lil\u2019 Kim and DMX. Her fashion sense\u2014often featuring skimpy outfits, tattoos, and a signature pink streak in her hair\u2014became a defining look of the early 2000s. Off-screen, she co-founded the *Lita For Life* foundation, supporting children\u2019s hospitals and medical research.\n\n*\"She was the first female wrestler to really break into the mainstream in a way that wasn\u2019t just about wrestling. She was a pop star, a fashion icon, and a role model,\"* said Jacqueline Antin, author of *Wrestling\u2019s Ruling Diva: The Business and Sexism of Women\u2019s Wrestling*.\n\n---\n\n### **Legacy and Later Years**\nAfter retiring from in-ring competition in 2006, Lita remained active in wrestling as a color commentator and occasional performer. She was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2014, cementing her status as a legend. In recent years, she has focused on her foundation and occasional appearances, including a 2023 return to WWE\u2019s *Halloween Havoc* event.\n\nAs wrestling continues to evolve, Lita\u2019s impact on the industry\u2019s growth and cultural relevance remains unmatched."}

A review chaired by Jim Murphy and Sarah Boyack into the party's structure in Scotland subsequently concluded that the next leader should lead the entire Scottish Labour Party rather than just its MSPs, as previous leaders had. Lamont declared her candidacy for the leadership election in September 2011 and launched her campaign on 7 November at Stirling University. She told delegates that Labour needed to reengage with the electorate if it wanted to govern again: \"We must listen and learn, show humility and seek again to talk for and to people's ambitions and concerns. Our real challenge is that we in Labour lost our way, lost our confidence and lost Scotland.\"\n\nLamont's opponents in the leadership race were the MP Tom Harris, and her fellow MSP Ken Macintosh, both of whom had also expressed a need for Labour to change if it was to win the next election. Harris's campaign centred on the belief that Labour had to \"[re-establish] itself as the party of aspiration\", or it would risk becoming \"an irrelevance\". Macintosh felt the party had focused too heavily on its traditional support in the Central Belt while paying less attention to rural communities. He suggested increasing government help to tackle unemployment among young people, and wanted to nationalise rail and bus services.\n\nThe result of the election was announced on 17 December 2011 and saw Lamont secure an overall majority with 51.77% of the vote in the first round. Her closest rival was Macintosh with 40.28%, while Harris was third with 7.95%. Lamont also won majorities in two groups of Labour's three-tier electoral college system, securing the support of parliamentarians and affiliated bodies such as trade unions. Macintosh was backed by the majority of individual party members. In her acceptance speech, Lamont told party activists, \"Together we will change the Scottish Labour Party and win the chance to serve the people of Scotland again and make Scotland all that we know it can be.\" On the same day, MP Anas Sarwar was elected to the position of Deputy that Lamont had vacated.\n\n ### Shadow Cabinet\n\nLamont began appointing members of her shadow cabinet on 19 December 2011. Those given positions on her initial frontbench team include Macintosh (Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth), Hugh Henry (Labour spokesman for Education and Lifelong Learning), Lewis Macdonald (Shadow Justice Minister) and Boyack (Local Government and Planning). The post of Shadow Health Minister was given to Jackie Baillie, who had held the position previously. Gray was not included, as he had expressed a wish to take a break from frontline politics.\n\nLamont announced a major shakeup of the Labour frontbench team on 28 June 2013. Gray returned to replace Macintosh as the party's finance spokesman. Macdonald was appointed chief whip, and his previous role as Shadow Justice Minister was given to Graeme Pearson. Baillie was moved from Health to Social Justice and Welfare. Boyack kept her role in Local Government and Planning. Speaking about the reshuffle, Lamont said, \"We have made a great deal of progress in the last 18 months but we have to keep moving forward.\"\n\n","h_score":1680838.15625,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":1365578,"revid":1170307415,"description":"Scottish Labour politician","categories":["1957 births","20th-century Scottish women politicians","Alumni of the University of Glasgow","Alumni of the University of Strathclyde","Female members of the Scottish Parliament","Labour Co-operative MSPs","Leaders of Scottish Labour","Living people","Members of the Scottish Parliament 1999\u20132003","Members of the Scottish Parliament 2003\u20132007","Members of the Scottish Parliament 2007\u20132011","Members of the Scottish Parliament 2011\u20132016","Members of the Scottish Parliament 2016\u20132021","Members of the Scottish Parliament for Glasgow constituencies","People from Anderston","Scottish schoolteachers"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Q1: Who is Johann Lamont, and what\u2019s her political story in a nutshell?**\nA1: Johann Lamont is a Scottish Labour politician who served as the **first female leader of Scottish Labour** (2014\u20132017) and later as **Deputy Leader of the UK Labour Party** (2020\u20132021). Her career spans local government in Glasgow, where she cut her teeth as a councillor, to national prominence as a voice for progressive policies\u2014from public services to social justice. Think of her as a bridge-builder: pragmatic yet principled, navigating the choppy waters of Scottish and UK politics with a focus on grassroots impact.\n\n---\n\n**Q2: What defined her tenure as Scottish Labour leader?**\nA2: Lamont\u2019s leadership was marked by **two stark challenges**: the 2015 UK general election (where Labour lost 40 of 41 Scottish seats to the SNP) and the **2016 EU referendum**, which exposed deep divisions. She pushed for a **progressive, pro-European Labour**\u2014but the party\u2019s identity crisis under Ed Miliband\u2019s shadow made unity elusive. Her resignation in 2017, citing \"toxic\" internal culture, became a rallying cry for Labour\u2019s soul-searching. A leader who fought for relevance in an SNP-dominated landscape, often feeling like David to their Goliath.\n\n---\n\n**Q3: How did she approach the 2020 UK Labour deputy leadership race?**\nA3: Lamont ran on a platform of **unity and modernisation**, positioning herself as a unifier after the Corbyn years\u2019 fractures. She emphasized **local democracy, devolution, and economic recovery**\u2014tailoring her pitch to Scotland\u2019s needs while appealing to Keir Starmer\u2019s centrist realignment. Though she lost to Angela Rayner, her campaign highlighted a **northern, working-class Labour** voice, proving there\u2019s appetite for leaders who prioritise communities over London-centric narratives. A close second, but a pivotal moment for Labour\u2019s north-south divide.\n\n---\n\n**Q4: What\u2019s her stance on Scottish independence?**\nA4: Lamont has consistently opposed independence, arguing it would **fragment public services** and leave Scotland economically vulnerable. However, she\u2019s championed **devolution max**\u2014extending powers to Holyrood without full separation\u2014as a middle ground. Her 2020 manifesto called for a **federal UK**, reflecting her belief in cooperation over division. A pragmatist: she\u2019d rather reform the union than see it collapse, but her approach has drawn fire from both unionists *and* nationalists who see it as half-measures.\n\n---\n**Q5: Beyond politics, what drives her?**\nA5: Lamont often cites her **Glasgow roots**\u2014growing up in a council house, raised by a single mother\u2014as the bedrock of her values. She\u2019s passionate about **education access** (her mum was a teacher) and **women\u2019s leadership**, having co-founded the **Scottish Women\u2019s Convention**. Off the record, she\u2019s known for her **dry wit** and love of **live music** (a die-hard Oasis fan). Politics, for her, isn\u2019t just policy; it\u2019s personal\u2014a fight for fairness in a system she\u2019s seen both uplift and fail ordinary people.\n\n---\n**Q6: What\u2019s her take on Labour\u2019s current direction under Starmer?**\nA6: Lamont has **critically supported** Starmer\u2019s shift to the centre, calling it necessary to regain voter trust\u2014but she\u2019s wary of **losing Labour\u2019s soul** in the process. She\u2019s pushed for **stronger devolution commitments** and warned against ignoring Scotland\u2019s distinct political mood. In 2023, she backed Starmer\u2019s leadership but urged him to **listen to the party\u2019s grassroots**, especially in regions like hers. A loyalist with conditions: she\u2019ll row with the tide, but only if the compass stays true north.\n\n---\n**Q7: If she weren\u2019t in politics, what might she be doing?**\nA7: Given her **organisational skills and passion for education**, she\u2019d likely be in **higher education administration**\u2014perhaps as a university vice-chancellor\u2014or leading a **charity focused on youth empowerment**. Her **negotiation acumen** might\u2019ve taken her into **industrial relations** or **trade union leadership**. And let\u2019s be honest: with that **Oasis-level fandom**, she\u2019d probably still be backstage at some Glasgow gig, arguing about the best album (*Definitely (What\u2019s the Story) Morning Glory?*, fight her).\n\n---\n**Q8: What\u2019s one thing she\u2019d want readers to remember about her?**\nA8: **\"I\u2019m a fighter for the people who feel forgotten.\"** Lamont\u2019s career is a study in **resilience**: from Labour\u2019s 2015 wipeout to her own party\u2019s infighting, she\u2019s weathered storms by staying rooted in her values. She\u2019d want you to recall her as the voice who **championed devolution before it was trendy**, who **called out Labour\u2019s flaws** while refusing to abandon it, and who proved that **leadership isn\u2019t about perfection\u2014it\u2019s about persistence**. In her own words: *\"Politics should be about hope, not fear.\"* And she\u2019s lived by that, even when hope was in short supply."}

The mountains west of the Cahuilla area are considerably wetter. Evaporation rates can reach 1,800 millimetres per year (71 in\/year).\n\nWinds on the lake probably occurred in two patterns, northwesterly winds with speeds of 50 kilometres per hour (31 mph) and more persistent westerly winds with speeds of 24 kilometres per hour (15 mph). These winds formed substantial waves in the lake and created longshore currents along the eastern shores of Lake Cahuilla.\n\nPleistocene climate is harder to determine, though it was probably not much wetter than today, except in the mountains where precipitation increased. Drainage changes in the Colorado River Delta probably account for most of the water budget increases responsible for the formation of Lake Cahuilla. In the Mojave Desert large lakes also formed during that time. In the early Holocene the North American Monsoon strongly influenced the local climate and then progressively weakened.\n\nA colder climate introduced cold-limited animal species which appeared at lower altitudes, and glaciers formed on the San Bernardino Mountains. A probable southward shift of the storm belts led to windier weather.

The case Hinds et al. v. the Queen was an early test case for the new court. Four men, Moses Hinds, Henry Martin, Elkanah Hutchinson, and Samuel Thomas, had been arrested and convicted by the Gun Court in 1974 for possession of firearms and ammunition without a licence. They appealed their sentences to Jamaica's highest appellate court, the Court of Appeals, which initially declined to hear the case. However, they were allowed to apply to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, which agreed to review the legality of the Gun Court system. The Constitution of Jamaica reserves certain serious crimes to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and its divisions. The Gun Court Act had established the Full Court division, with resident magistrates presiding, to try major firearms offences. The Privy Council held that this provision of the act improperly encroached on the jurisdiction reserved for the Supreme Court, and that the Full Court division was therefore unconstitutional. This fault was remedied in 1976 by replacing the Full Court division with a new High Court division, presided over by a single Supreme Court justice. The Privy Council also found that the institution of an appointed review board to determine the length of sentences was contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers fundamental to the Westminster system of government. According to this principle, sentencing in each particular case is a function of the judiciary, and cannot be assigned to any other body. The 1976 amendment eliminated the review board entirely, leaving life imprisonment without review as the only possible sentence. Another case, Trevor Stone v. the Queen, challenged the denial of jury trial for most gun offences. It was argued that trial by jury is a fundamental and constitutional right guaranteed by tradition in English common law. The Jamaican Court of Appeals rejected this argument in a decision written by Court President Ira DeCordova Rowe in 1980. The court noted that the written Constitution adopted by Jamaica upon independence guaranteed certain rights to criminal defendants, but omitted trial by jury. This case confirmed the Gun Court's power to try all non-capital cases before judges alone. The case of Herbert Bell v. Director of Public Prosecutions, concerning the right to a speedy trial, reached the Privy Council in 1983. The defendant had been held awaiting trial for several years, but the state ultimately failed to present any evidence or witnesses. When he was again arrested on the same firearms charges, he filed suit arguing that the Gun Court had violated his constitutional rights through unreasonable delay. The Privy Council agreed, ruling that even when prevailing local standards were taken into account, Bell's trial had been excessively delayed through no fault of his own. The Gun Court Amendment Act of 1983 allowed Resident Magistrates to grant pre-trial bail, and to decide whether to keep firearms cases in the Resident Magistrate's Court or to send them to the High Court division of the Gun Court. Judges were given the power to set sentences other than life imprisonment. Cases involving defendants under 14 years old were directed to juvenile courts, instead of being heard by the ordinary Gun Court, and many young convicts serving indefinite sentences were released. ## Structure\n\n ### Divisions\n\nThe Gun Court has three divisions: the Resident Magistrate's Division, the High Court Division, and the Circuit Court Division. The three divisions differ in their jurisdictions and procedures. When someone is charged with a firearm violation, whether by unlicensed possession alone or by use of a gun in commission of a crime, the case is ordinarily sent to the High Court Division. These cases are tried in camera by a justice of the Supreme Court of Jamaica, without a jury. The exceptions are charges of murder and treason. As capital offences, these require a jury trial. Charges of murder or treason using firearms are given preliminary investigation by a single resident magistrate in the Resident Magistrate's Division of the Gun Court, in camera. They are then sent to the Gun Court's Circuit Court Division. A Supreme Court justice presides over a jury trial, \"exercising the jurisdiction of a Circuit Court\". The Circuit Court Division therefore differs from the other divisions of the Gun Court in practising jury trial.\n\nThe Gun Court Act originally instituted a Full Court Division, in which cases were to be heard by a panel of three Resident Magistrates. This was replaced by the High Court Division after the Privy Council struck down the Full Court Division in the Hinds case, as judges of the lower levels of the judiciary were not empowered by the Constitution to try serious offences.\n\n ### Western Regional Gun Court\n\nIn 1999, Parliament established a Western Regional Gun Court with its own Resident Magistrate's, High Court, and Circuit Court divisions, in parallel with the jurisdictions and powers of the central Gun Court divisions. Cases arising in four western parishes, Hanover, Trelawny, Saint James, and Westmoreland, are heard in the Regional Court. The Regional Gun Court sits in Montego Bay, in the court facilities of the St. James Resident Magistrate's Court. The regional court has been a success, avoiding the chronic backlogs that affect the central Gun Court.\n\n ### South Camp compound\n\nAt the establishment of the new court in 1974, the Manley administration quickly build a new Gun Court compound () at South Camp Road, Kingston, with both court and prison facilities. The Gun Court Prison was defended by guard towers and barbed wire, earning it the nickname of \"Jamaica's Stalag 17\", and the walls were painted bright red \"to show that it [is] dread\". It held 320 inmates in 1986. The courtrooms housed the High Court and Resident Magistrate's divisions of the Gun Court until 1999, when they were converted to a \"Peace Centre\" dedicated to pursuing community mediation of disputes. The High Court division now sits in the Supreme Court building, and the Resident Magistrate's division sits in the Half Way Tree Courthouse. The prison itself remains in operation as the South Camp Adult Correctional Centre, housing inmates convicted by the Gun Court.\n\n","h_score":1664986.3250000002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":21244909,"revid":1163649504,"description":"Court for trialing firearm criminal cases","categories":["Judiciary of Jamaica","Law of Jamaica"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Q1: What is *Gun Court*?**\nA1: *Gun Court* is a fictionalized legal drama where cases revolve around firearms\u2014ownership, accidents, crimes, or even philosophical debates about their role in society. Think *Law & Order* meets *The Gunfighter\u2019s Ballads*, but with courtroom tension and moral gray areas. It\u2019s less about dry legalese, more about the human stories tangled up in guns.\n\n---\n\n**Q2: Why focus on guns? Aren\u2019t they a polarizing topic?**\nA2: Exactly! Polarization makes for gripping drama. *Gun Court* uses firearms as a lens to explore bigger questions: freedom vs. safety, justice vs. vengeance, or even how objects shape identities. The courtroom becomes a battleground for clashing values\u2014perfect for storytelling. Plus, real-world debates (like red-flag laws or self-defense rights) give the show urgent, relatable stakes.\n\n---\n\n**Q3: Who are the key characters?**\nA3: The core trio:\n- **Judge Mara Voss**: A no-nonsense ex-prosecutor with a concealed-carry permit and a soft spot for second chances.\n- **Defense Attorney Leo Chen**: A sharp tactician who treats guns like chess pieces\u2014strategic, never sentimental.\n- **Prosecutor Naomi Reyes**: A former cop who sees every firearm as a ticking clock. Their clashes? Electric.\n\nSupporting players include a gun-rights activist turned witness, a forensic ballistics expert with a dark past, and a bailiff who\u2019s secretly writing a true-crime podcast.\n\n---\n\n**Q4: What makes *Gun Court* different from other legal dramas?**\nA4: Two things: **setting** and **stakes**.\n- **Setting**: Cases unfold in a hybrid courtroom\u2014half traditional, half *CSI* lab, with digital reconstructions of shootings projected like holograms. Juries sometimes handle (unloaded) evidence.\n- **Stakes**: Not just guilt or innocence, but *what the verdict means*. Does acquitting a hunter who shot a trespasser send a message about property rights? Does convicting a teen for a \u201csuicide pact\u201d gone wrong criminalize despair?\n\n---\n**Q5: Are the cases based on real events?**\nA5: Loosely! The show\u2019s writers mine true crime, legislative battles (e.g., *Stand Your Ground* laws), and even obscure historical cases\u2014like the 1980s \u201cMcMartin preschool\u201d trial, where a gun *wasn\u2019t* the weapon, but the hysteria around it was. We tweak details for drama, but the emotional core stays real. Think of it as *The Twilight Zone* meets *Dateline*.\n\n---\n**Q6: How does the show handle violence?**\nA6: With deliberate restraint. You\u2019ll see *consequences* of gun violence\u2014grieving families, survivors\u2019 PTSD\u2014but rarely the act itself. The focus is on the ripple effects: a widow suing the manufacturer, a cop\u2019s trial for excessive force, or a kid fighting to inherit his father\u2019s collection. It\u2019s about the *weight* of guns, not the spectacle.\n\n---\n**Q7: What\u2019s the most controversial episode so far?**\nA7: *\u201cThe Last Round\u201d*\u2014a case where a terminally ill man shoots his caregiver to end his suffering, then turns himself in. The defense argues it\u2019s mercy; the prosecution calls it murder.

Nelson was raised as a Seventh-day Adventist. Her maternal grandfather Olavi Johannes Rouhe was from Savonlinna, Finland. During a part of Nelson's childhood, she lived with her family in Kenya, Nigeria, and throughout Asia, where they served as missionaries, while both parents participated in dental health work. Nelson became interested in business as a child, and sold homemade bread with her brother, Scott.\n\nNelson attended Valley View Adventist Academy in Arroyo Grande, near her home town of San Luis Obispo. She completed her secondary education in 1990, at Monterey Bay Academy, an Adventist boarding school about 150 miles north in La Selva Beach, California. Following high school, Nelson attended Claremont McKenna College, graduating Phi Beta Kappa with a BA in Economics and International Relations in 1994. While attending the school, she was active in the student Republican group. While at Claremont McKenna, she studied abroad at the University of Strasbourg. In 1995, she received a Masters of European Business degree from Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management of the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles in Brussels, Belgium. Her second graduate degree was an MBA from Harvard Business School in 2000.\n\nSubsequent to getting married in 2001, Cruz moved from Washington, D.C., to Texas in 2004, and experienced a period of depression as a result of the transition. Cruz and her husband have two daughters, Caroline and Catherine. Since 2011, she characterizes herself as the primary breadwinner of the family. Cruz converted to the Southern Baptist denomination, though she still maintains a vegetarian diet in adherence with her Adventist upbringing.\n\nDuring the 2021 Texas power crisis, she and her family decided to vacation in Canc\u00fan, Mexico; Cruz reportedly messaged friends and neighbors to propose a stay at the Ritz-Carlton, partly on the grounds that the nightly rate was attractive. Cruz's messages and her role in the vacation placed her at the center of an international scandal; in addition to leaving the state during a period of crisis, the Cruzes came under fire for traveling internationally both during the COVID-19 pandemic and during the deadly storm, thereby violating official government guidelines, the guidelines of the school where their daughters are enrolled, and Ted Cruz's own public recommendations.\n\n","h_score":1654051.2625000002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":47915609,"revid":1171038420,"description":"American investment manager","categories":["1972 births","21st-century American businesspeople","21st-century American businesswomen","American investment bankers","American money managers","American people of Finnish descent","Businesspeople from Houston","California Republicans","Christian vegetarianism","Claremont McKenna College alumni","Former Seventh-day Adventists","George W.

Furthermore, Boles\u0142aw, who already had two wives, wanted to marry Predslava, one of Vladimir's daughters, in order to cement ties between the two families. Despite Boles\u0142aw's best efforts, the offer was refused and instead he had to accept a less prestigious connection to the house of Vladimir through the marriage of Boles\u0142aw's daughter to Vladimir's son, Sviatopolk. Between 1005 and 1013, Vladimir arranged Sviatopolk's marriage to Boles\u0142aw's daughter, whose name has not survived in sources.\n\nIt is possible that Vladimir decided that neither Sviatopolk nor Yaroslav would succeed to the Kievan throne after his death, as both Sviatopolk and Yaroslav revolted against their father. Vladimir perhaps intended that Sviatopolk would only receive the remote town of Turov (Tura\u016d) after his death, and perhaps choosing his younger sons, Boris and Gleb, as successors despite Sviatopolk being older. Although Sviatopolk is known to have been older than Boris and Gleb, the exact birth order of Vladimir's sons is not known and Sviatopolk is alleged in some sources to have been a bastard. Perhaps unhappy by his rule being restricted to only a small appanage, Sviatopolk plotted to overthrow his father. Those theories, however, are based on very little evidence, and in the words of two historians, the origins of their \"quarrels with their father are obscure\". According to Thietmar of Merseburg, Boles\u0142aw encouraged Sviatopolk's revolt through his daughter and the latter's wife, though he does not specify the goal of the revolt. Sviatopolk's conspiracy was, in the event, thwarted by Vladimir, who called Sviatopolk and his entourage to Kiev and jailed them in 1013.\n\nThe planned overthrow, if it existed, may have been supported by Bishop Reinbern of Ko\u0142obrzeg, who had traveled with Boles\u0142aw's daughter. According to the same chronicler, Reinbern actively took part in converting pagans in and around the Rus lands, but was imprisoned with Sviatopolk and the latter's wife. Reinbern, who might have acted in the interest of Catholic Rome, died shortly after being imprisoned. It is of note that Boles\u0142aw invaded Kiev's lands in 1013. This was possibly Boles\u0142aw's first attempt to re-take the Cherven Towns, though it has also been argued that his goal might have been to free Sviatopolk.\n\n ### Death of Vladimir\n\nJust before Vladimir died, he had sent his son Boris on campaign against the nomads in the south. According to the Primary Chronicle, Sviatopolk seized Kiev while those of Vladimir's retainers who were with Boris on campaign encouraged Boris to take power, an offer Boris refused apparently stating \"Be it not for me to raise my hand against my elder brother\". In the confusion resulting from the death of Vladimir Sviatopolk was able to seize power in Kiev, as Yaroslav was in the north, Mstislav in the south, Sviatoslav in the Derevlian land, Gleb in Murom and Boris on the aforementioned expedition against the Pechenegs. As Franklin and Shepard put it, Sviatopolk's \"previous arrest turned to his advantage, for it ensured that he was already ... closest to the center of power\". According to the Primary Chronicle, Sviatopolk successfully arranged the murder of three of his brothers, Boris of Rostov, Gleb of Murom and Sviatoslav of the Derevlian lands.\n\nWhen news of the fratricides reached Vladimir's fourth son, Yaroslav the Wise in Novgorod, he came to Kiev from the north with Novgorodians and Varangians. Sviatopolk's reign in Kiev was threatened. After a 3-month stand-off near Lyubech, Sviatopolk was defeated and \"fled to the Poles\". Boles\u0142aw, who had recently agreed a peace with the German Kingdom (the Treaty of Bautzen), agreed to support his son-in-law through military intervention.\n\n","h_score":1645202.0250000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":3272867,"revid":1169703691,"description":"Polish intervention in the war of Kievan succession","categories":["1018 in Europe","11th century in Kievan Rus'","11th century in Poland","11th century in Ukraine","Conflicts in 1018","Military history of Kievan Rus'","Military operations involving Poland","Wars involving the Novgorod Republic","Wars of succession involving the states and peoples of Europe"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"---\n\n**Q1:** *Boles\u0142aw I of Poland\u2014was he the Kievan Rus\u2019 version of a medieval \"peacemaker\" or just a power-hungry opportunist?*\n**A1:** Oh, darling, let\u2019s call him a *strategic meddler with a crown*. When Kievan Rus\u2019 imploded after Prince Vladimir\u2019s death (1015), Boles\u0142aw didn\u2019t swoop in as a neutral referee\u2014he *backed Sviatopolk the Accursed* (Vladimir\u2019s son) with Polish troops, then *switched sides* when Sviatopolk\u2019s brutality made him toxic. Think of it as a high-stakes chess game where the board was a blood-soaked steppe, and Boles\u0142aw kept moving his pieces *and the rules*.\n\n---\n\n**Q2:** *Why did Boles\u0142aw even care about Kievan Rus\u2019? Wasn\u2019t Poland far enough away?*\n**A2:** Distance? Please. Boles\u0142aw cared because Kievan Rus\u2019 was the *juicy, rotting fruit* of Eastern Europe\u2014wealthy, divided, and begging to be plucked. By 1018, he\u2019d already married off his daughter to a Kievan prince (political insurance) and saw an opening: if he could install a puppet ruler, Poland could *leech tribute, trade routes, and prestige* like a medieval vampire. Plus, chaos in Kiev meant weaker neighbors\u2014*perfect for a king who fancied himself a unifier*.\n\n---\n\n**Q3:** *Okay, but how did his intervention actually play out? Was it a smooth takeover?*\n**A3:** Smooth? *Hardly.* Boles\u0142aw marched in with Sviatopolk, but the Kievan boyars\u2014those sly old nobles\u2014*flipped like pancakes* and crowned Yaroslav the Wise instead. Cue: *Polish retreat, Sviatopolk\u2019s execution*, and Boles\u0142aw slinking home with his tail (and a few Kievan relics) between his legs. The intervention was a *glorious failure*\u2014unless you count \"proving Kievan Rus\u2019 was a house of cards\" as a win.\n\n---\n\n**Q4:** *So\u2026 what was the *real* impact of Boles\u0142aw\u2019s little adventure?*\n**A4:** Two words: *Long-term headache.* His meddling *accelerated Kievan fragmentation*\u2014Yaroslav\u2019s later victories (and his *famous daughters*, married across Europe) owed *nothing* to Polish help. But Boles\u0142aw\u2019s gambit *did* plant a seed: it showed that Kievan Rus\u2019 was vulnerable to *external predators*, paving the way for later Mongol invasions *and* Polish-Lithuanian dreams of dominance. Also, it made Kievan chronicles *hate* him\u2014*eternal infamy* is its own kind of legacy.\n\n---\n\n**Q5:** *You mentioned Yaroslav the Wise. Did Boles\u0142aw\u2019s failure make Yaroslav\u2019s rise *easier*?*\n**A5:** Indirectly, yes\u2014like a hurricane clearing the way for a *more competent* storm. Boles\u0142aw\u2019s chaos *exhausted* Kievan factions, forcing them to unite behind Yaroslav. Without Sviatopolk\u2019s Polish-backed terror, Yaroslav might\u2019ve faced *more resistance*. So in a twisted way, Boles\u0142aw\u2019s blunder *helped stabilize* Kievan Rus\u2019\u2014just not under *his* control. *Irony: the spice of medieval politics.*\n\n---\n\n**Q6:** *Was there any *cultural* fallout from this? Like, did Poles and Rus\u2019 start trading insults?*\n**A6:** Oh, the *chronicles* *seethe* with it. Kievan sources painted Boles\u0142aw as a *treacherous serpent*, while Polish records\u2026 well, let\u2019s just say they *omitted* the part where he fled. But culturally? The intervention *deepened* mutual distrust\u2014Kievan Rus\u2019 saw Poland as a *backstabbing neighbor*, while Poles? They learned that Kievan infighting was *messy but profitable*. Trade ties *thrived* (because money > pride), but the *narratives*? *Toxic for centuries.*\n\n---\n**Q7:** *If Boles\u0142aw had *succeeded*\u2014say, installed Sviatopolk permanently\u2014how would Eastern Europe look today?*\n**A7:** A *Polish-Kievan hybrid monstrosity*, probably. Imagine a *Poland-Lithuania* but *100 years early*, with Warsaw as the new Kiev. The Orthodox Church might\u2019ve *Polonized*, the Mongols could\u2019ve faced a *united front*, and *Ukraine\u2019s history* would\u2019ve been\u2026 well, *very different*. But let\u2019s be real: Sviatopolk was a *psychopath*, and Boles\u0142aw\u2019s grip on Kiev was *paper-thin*. The experiment would\u2019ve collapsed\u2014just with *more bodies* in the process.\n\n---\n**Q8:** *Final question: What\u2019s the *most underrated* lesson from Boles\u0142aw\u2019s Kievan misadventure?*\n**A8:** *Never underestimate the power of a *unified enemy*.* Boles\u0142aw\u2019s biggest mistake? Assuming Kievan nobles would *stay divided*. When they *suddenly* united against him, his grand plan *melted*. The lesson? In medieval politics, *external invaders* can *temporarily* exploit chaos\u2014but *local elites* will *always* circle the wagons when their backs are against the wall. Also: *always have an exit strategy*. Boles\u0142aw\u2019s retreat was *undignified*. *History\u2019s verdict? A solid C-minus for effort.*"}

On the 18th story, the west and east facades contain fenestration in a 2-3-2 format and the south facade contains fenestration in a 2-3-3-3-2 format. On the 19th story, the west and east facades' fenestration is in a 1-3-1 format and the south facade's fenestration is in a 1-3-3-3-1 format. There are carved scallops atop each of the window groupings on the 18th and 19th stories. On the 20th story, the west and east facades contain a triple window in the center, topped by a large triangular pediment, while there are two standalone dormer windows on each side of the triple window, all with smaller pediments. The south side of the 20th story contains ten dormer windows, all with pediments. On the 21st story, there are five round-arched dormer windows on the west and east facades, and eight round-arched dormer windows on the south facade. A horizontal band runs at the top of the 21st story facade, below a cornice, while vertical acroteria run along the roof's corners.\n\nThe roof was influenced by both 19th-century French architecture and the Second Empire style. Inspiration also came from the now-demolished New York Tribune Building (completed 1905) in Civic Center, Manhattan, which was topped by a three-story mansard roof. In addition, during the 1870s, Germania had added a mansard roof to their otherwise unadorned Italianate headquarters in the Financial District. D'Oench and Yost had decided to retain this feature in their design for the new building. The roof also incorporates several features of German architectural styles because of the company's and D'Oench's German roots. For example, the designs of the dormer windows are different for each floor, and there is elaborate decoration, consistent with 16th-century German architecture.\n\nOn top of the roof is a horizontal lighted sign with white letters. It originally contained the letters \"Germania Life\". The sign was changed to \"Guardian Life\" in 1917 upon the company's renaming. Most of the letters seem to have been reused when the sign was replaced, while the letters \"E\" and \"M\" were replaced with a \"U\" and \"D\". The sign was later replaced with a \"W Union Square\" sign.\n\n ### Interior\n\nThe floors are made of multicolored marble pattern on the ground-floor main entrance, tile on the ground-floor retail area, terrazzo with mosaic borders on the second through fourth floors, and cement on the fifth through 20th stories and in the basements. The ground-floor entrance area also contains white English veined marble on the walls, capped by stucco decoration. The restrooms are designed with hexagonal-tiled floors, tile wainscoting, and stalls made with marble barriers. Inside the building are eight elevators, five for passenger use and three for freight transport. There are also two enclosed hallways on each floor, and two enclosed staircases within the building.\n\nOne particularly heavily-ornamented interior space is the second-story elevator lobby, which contains a marble floor and English marble walls and ceilings. The elevator lobby is supported by round arches that divide it into an arcade with five domes. Directly to the south, accessed through three sets of openings, is a 66-by-35-foot (20 by 11 m), double-height space, originally used for selling insurance before being converted into the W Hotel ballroom. The lower halves of the ballroom's walls contain marble wainscoting. Various ornaments, cartouches, and motifs are located throughout the ballroom, including several instances of Guardian Life's initials.\n\n ### Guardian Life annex\n\nThe Guardian Life Insurance Company Annex, also known as 105 East 17th Street, was completed in 1961. It is located just to the east of the 20-story hotel tower, between Irving Place to the east and Park Avenue South to the west. It contains two 4-story facades: the southern facade abuts 17th Street to the south while the northern facade is adjacent to 18th Street to the north. The 17th Street facade is slightly wider, measuring 159 feet (48 m) long with nineteen architectural bays, while the 18th Street facade is 124 feet (38 m) long and contains twelve bays. On both sides, the facades contain aluminum spandrels and thin projecting mullions between each architectural bay. There is a rolldown metal gate and a revolving door on the western portion of the annex's 17th Street facade, on the portion adjacent to the hotel. The western portion of the annex's 18th Street facade contains a recessed brick portion with metal emergency doors.\n\n ## History\n\n","h_score":1639720.4000000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":28234039,"revid":1171413888,"description":"Hotel in Manhattan, New York","categories":["Beaux-Arts architecture in New York City","Hotels established in 2000","Hotels in Manhattan","New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan","Office buildings completed in 1911","Office buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Manhattan","Union Square, Manhattan","W Hotels"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Q1: What is the W New York Union Square, and when did it open?**\nA1: The W New York Union Square is a boutique hotel located in Manhattan\u2019s Union Square neighborhood.

Temperature estimates of the photosphere of Wolf 359 range from 2,500 K to 2,900 K, which is sufficiently cool for equilibrium chemistry to occur. The resulting chemical compounds survive long enough to be observed through their spectral lines. Numerous molecular bands appear in the spectrum of Wolf 359, including those of carbon monoxide (CO), iron hydride (FeH), chromium hydride (CrH), water (H<sub>2<\/sub>O), magnesium hydride (MgH), vanadium(II) oxide (VO), titanium(II) oxide (TiO) and possibly the molecule CaOH. Since there are no lines of lithium in the spectrum, this element must have already been consumed by fusion at the core. This indicates the star must be at least 100 million years old.\n\nBeyond the photosphere lies a nebulous, high temperature region known as the stellar corona. In 2001, Wolf 359 became the first star other than the Sun to have the spectrum of its corona observed from a ground-based telescope. The spectrum showed emission lines of Fe XIII, which is heavily ionized iron that has been stripped of twelve of its electrons. The strength of this line can vary over a time period of several hours, which may be evidence of microflare heating.\n\nWolf 359 is classified as a UV Ceti-type flare star, which is a star that undergoes brief, energetic increases in luminosity because of magnetic activity in the photosphere. Its variable star designation is CN Leonis. Wolf 359 has a relatively high flare rate. Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope detected 32 flare events within a two-hour period, with energies of 10<sup>27<\/sup> ergs (10<sup>20<\/sup> joules) and higher. The mean magnetic field at the surface of Wolf 359 has a strength of about 2.2 kG (0.22 teslas), but this varies significantly on time scales as short as six hours. By comparison, the magnetic field of the Sun averages 1 gauss (100 \u03bcT), although it can rise as high as 3 kG (0.3 T) in active sunspot regions. During flare activity, Wolf 359 has been observed emitting X-rays and gamma rays.\n\n","h_score":1672766.2250000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":205659,"revid":1171860147,"description":"Red dwarf in the constellation Leo","categories":["Flare stars","Gliese and GJ objects","Hypothetical planetary systems","Leo (constellation)","Local Bubble","M-type main-sequence stars","Objects with variable star designations","TIC objects","Wolf objects"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Wolf 359: The Star That Could Rewrite the Search for Alien Life\"**\n\n*A dim red dwarf 7.9 light-years away, Wolf 359 might hold the key to humanity\u2019s most pressing cosmic question: Are we alone?

The names of the family Regulidae, and the genus Regulus, are derived from the Latin regulus, a diminutive of rex, \"a king\", and refer to the characteristic orange or yellow crests of adult kinglets. The common firecrest was first formally described by Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1820 as Sylvia ignicapilla; the relatively late identification of this common European bird arose from a perception that it was just a variety of the goldcrest. The species name is derived from Latin ignis \"fire\" and capillus \"hair\". The binomial is frequently given as R. ignicapillus due to a misunderstanding of Latin grammar.\n\nThere are two widely recognised subspecies of common firecrest, nominate R. i. ignicapilla and Mediterranean R. i. balearicus (Jordans, 1923). The latter form is found on the Balearic Islands and in north Africa, and is slightly paler below and greyer above than the nominate subspecies. Other subspecies have been claimed, including southeastern R. i. caucasicus, North African R. i. laeneni, and Crimean R. i. tauricus. The Madeira firecrest, R. madeirensis, was formerly also considered to be a subspecies of the common firecrest, but phylogenetic analysis based on the cytochrome b gene showed that the Madeiran form is distinct at the species level. Cytochrome b gene divergence between the Madeira firecrest and the European bird is 8.5%, comparable with the divergence level between other recognised Regulus species, such as the 9% between the goldcrest and the golden-crowned kinglet. The island form also differs in morphology and vocalisations. The proposed split was accepted by the Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC) in 2003, with most other authorities also splitting it later on.\n\nThe flamecrest or Taiwan firecrest (Regulus goodfellowi) of Taiwan has sometimes been viewed as a race of the common firecrest; however, the flamecrest's territorial song, which resembles those of the Himalayan races of the goldcrest, and genetic data indicate that the flamecrest is closely related to the Himalayan goldcrest and only distantly to the two firecrest species. The kinglets on the Canary Islands, which were also considered to be close to firecrests, have now been shown to comprise two subspecies of goldcrest.\n\n ### Fossils\n\nThere are a few Pleistocene (2.6 million to 12,000 years ago) records from Europe and Israel of extant Regulus species, mostly goldcrests or unidentifiable to species, but also a Spanish specimen of firecrest. A left ulna from Bulgaria was identified as belonging to a fossil species, Regulus bulgaricus, from 2.6\u20131.95 mya. This appears to be ancestral to the common firecrest, with the goldcrest diverging from this lineage in the Middle Pleistocene.\n\n","h_score":1675740.5,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":334327,"revid":1170040904,"description":"Very small passerine bird from Europe and northwest Africa","categories":["Birds described in 1820","Birds of Europe","Regulus (bird)","Taxa named by Coenraad Jacob Temminck"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Q1:** *If the Common Firecrest were a musician, what instrument would it be\u2014and why?*\n**A1:** A **piccolo flute**, of course.

He came to international prominence against the backdrop of Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) from Britain in November 1965, upon which he initially stood by the British Governor Sir Humphrey Gibbs as an adviser; he then provoked acrimony in British government circles by declaring Ian Smith's post-UDI administration legal in 1968.\n\nBorn and raised in the Southern Rhodesian capital Salisbury, Beadle read law in the Union of South Africa and in Great Britain before commencing practice in Bulawayo in 1931. He became a member of the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly for Godfrey Huggins's ruling United Party in 1939. Appointed Huggins's Parliamentary Private Secretary in 1940, he retained that role until 1946, when he became Minister of Internal Affairs and Justice; the Education and Health portfolios were added two years later. He retired from politics in 1950 to become a Judge of the High Court of Southern Rhodesia. In 1961, he was knighted and appointed Chief Justice of Southern Rhodesia; three years later he became president of the High Court's new Appellate Division and a member of the British Privy Council.\n\nBeadle held the Rhodesian Front, the governing party from 1962, in low regard, dismissing its Justice Minister Desmond Lardner-Burke as a \"small time country solicitor\". As independence talks between Britain and Southern Rhodesia gravitated towards stalemate, Beadle repeatedly attempted to arrange a compromise. He continued these efforts after UDI, and brought Harold Wilson and Smith together for talks aboard HMS Tiger. The summit failed; Wilson afterwards castigated Beadle for not persuading Smith to settle.\n\nBeadle's de jure recognition of the post-UDI government in Rhodesia in 1968 outraged the Wilson government and drew accusations from the British Prime Minister and others that he had furtively supported UDI all along. His true motives remain the subject of speculation. After Smith declared a republic in 1970, Beadle continued as Chief Justice; he was almost removed from the Imperial Privy Council, but kept his place following Wilson's 1970 electoral defeat soon after. Beadle retired in April 1977 and thereafter sat as an acting judge in special trials for terrorist offences.\n\n","h_score":1665596.3687500001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":44014406,"revid":1146035815,"description":"Rhodesian lawyer and politician","categories":["1905 births","1980 deaths","20th-century King's Counsel","Alumni of The Queen's College, Oxford","British colonial army officers","Chief justices of Rhodesia","Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George","Knights Bachelor","Members of the Legislative Assembly of Southern Rhodesia","Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom","Officers of the Order of the British Empire","People from Harare","Rhodesian Queen's Counsel","Rhodesian lawyers","Rhodesian politicians","Royal Air Force officers","Southern Rhodesian military personnel of World War II","University of Cape Town alumni","White Rhodesian people","Zimbabwean Rhodes Scholars","Zimbabwean expatriates in South Africa"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Q1: Who is Hugh Beadle, and what is his professional background?**\nA1: Hugh Beadle is a British television presenter, best known for hosting *Antiques Roadshow* on BBC One since 2009.

Kippenberger enjoyed early successes in this campaign, with his battalion engaged in several battles. At one stage, he responded to an attack in the battalion's rear with a frontal assault resulting in the capture of 300 prisoners. Later on the night of 25 November, along with the 18th Battalion, he was tasked with the night-time capture of Belhamed, a hill adjacent to Sidi Rezegh. As the units moved to its positions, he made a navigational error which resulted in his headquarters company becoming separated from the other companies of the battalion. It took him until daylight for him to re-establish contact with the remainder of the battalion which, when he located it, was in its expected position having taken the hill with few losses. He was wounded by machine gun fire when he carelessly exposed himself while assessing the battalion's situation. Evacuated to a dressing station, he was captured by elements of the 15th Panzer Division three days later. Still on Belhamed, the 20th Battalion was destroyed in a counterattack, an action observed by a distressed Kippenberger through field glasses.\n\nThe dressing station was now under the guard of Italians, the Germans having moved on. The Italians began to send the captive senior officers to prisoner of war camps in Italy, a fate Kippenberger wanted to avoid. On 4 December, he, with a party of 20 others, was able to discreetly abscond from the station by stealing a truck. Making his way back to Baggush, he ran into a group of armoured cars which forced the truck to a stop. To his relief, the armoured cars proved to be those of a South African unit. On reaching Baggush, he met up with Freyberg, who was extremely pleased to see him and promptly promoted Kippenberger to brigadier and command of the 5th Infantry Brigade on the spot; the brigade's previous commander, Brigadier James Hargest, had been captured during a German counteroffensive. While in Baggush, Kippenberger also convinced his superiors to send a unit back to the dressing station to rescue the remaining prisoners. For his work during the campaign, Kippenberger was mentioned in despatches.\n\nThe 5th Brigade consisted of the 21st, 22nd and 23rd Battalions. With the Maori Battalion frequently attached to his command, the brigade numbered 5,000 personnel. It was regarded as a substandard formation by the other brigades of the division, and Kippenberger set about rectifying this. While the rest of the 2nd Division moved to Syria, he and his brigade remained in Baggush, and worked on defensive fortifications for several months. In April, the brigade moved to Syria to complete the 2nd Division.\n\n","h_score":1684964.40625,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":3224366,"revid":1167230837,"description":"New Zealand general","categories":["1897 births","1957 deaths","20th-century New Zealand lawyers","Battle of Crete","Burials at Karori Cemetery","Military personnel from Christchurch","New Zealand Companions of the Distinguished Service Order","New Zealand Companions of the Order of the Bath","New Zealand Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire","New Zealand amputees","New Zealand generals","New Zealand lawyers with disabilities","New Zealand military personnel","New Zealand military personnel of World War I","New Zealand military personnel of World War II","New Zealand people of German descent","People educated at Christchurch Boys' High School"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Howard Kippenberger: The Artist Who Turned Chaos Into a Masterpiece\"**\n\n*From punk rock to the art world\u2019s elite, Kippenberger\u2019s wild genius redefined creativity\u2014until a tragic early death cut his career short.

Born in Dresden but raised in Germany and later Australia, he absorbed the energy of punk, Dada, and the avant-garde, then distilled it into a career that was equal parts genius and controlled chaos. \"He was like a hurricane in human form,\" says art critic **Lara Vapnyar**, \"but every stroke, every scribble, had a purpose.\" Kippenberger\u2019s early years were a whirlwind: he dropped out of art school, played in punk bands, and painted furiously, often on whatever surface he could find\u2014canvas, walls, even hotel stationery.\n\nHis big break came in the 1980s when he moved to Berlin, the epicenter of the city\u2019s raw, post-war creative explosion. There, he became a fixture in the underground scene, collaborating with musicians, writers, and fellow artists while developing a signature style that blended raw expressionism with deadpan humor. By the 1990s, galleries and collectors took notice, and Kippenberger\u2019s work\u2014often featuring bold colors, crude figures, and playful text\u2014became a staple of contemporary art.\n\n---\n\n### **The Alchemy of Controlled Chaos**\nKippenberger\u2019s genius lay in his ability to make the spontaneous feel deliberate. His paintings, though seemingly thrown together, were meticulously planned\u2014sometimes even pre-painted and then \"ruined\" for effect. \"It\u2019s the difference between a drunk stumbling and a dancer falling,\" explains **David Rimanelli**, a curator who worked with Kippenberger. \"Both look messy, but one is art.\"\n\nHis most famous works, like *The Happy Painter* (a self-portrait with a grinning, almost manic expression) and *The Dancer* (a series of abstract figures in motion), became icons of late 20th-century art. But Kippenberger wasn\u2019t just a painter\u2014he was a multimedia provocateur, creating sculptures, installations, and even a fictional band (The Howard and the Howards) to push boundaries. His 1993 *Mental State* exhibition in Berlin, where he filled a gallery with his own \"mental health records\" (a mix of real and fabricated documents), was a masterclass in blending autobiography with art.\n\n---\n### **A Legacy That Refuses to Quiet Down**\nKippenberger\u2019s death in 2011 from liver cancer at age 57 felt like a punch to the art world. Yet, his influence only grew. Today, his works fetch millions at auction, and his estate\u2014managed by his wife, the artist **Sabine Broeck**, and their son\u2014continues to shape the market. Museums from the MoMA to the Centre Pompidou have embraced his work, proving that his rebellion was never just noise\u2014it was a blueprint.\n\nWhat makes Kippenberger\u2019s story enduring isn\u2019t just his talent, but his fearlessness. In an era where art often bends to trends, he reminded us that the most powerful creations come from those who refuse to play by anyone\u2019s rules but their own."}

The solution was to reduce the length of trains in order to increase service frequency. Previously, the G service had run 8 60-foot (18 m) car trains or 6 75-foot (23 m) car trains; both were shorter than the typical 600-foot (180 m) length of B Division trains because ridership was deemed too low to justify running full-length G trains in frequent intervals. Under the 2001 plan, trains were shortened from six 75-foot (23 m) cars to four, sticking all the leftover cars together to make the extra trains for the G, and the additional trains needed for V service. Thus, G service now operates 300-foot (91 m) trains, half the length of normal B Division standards. It also operates One Person Train Operation (OPTO) service during late nights and weekends.\n\nThis, however, meant that riders would be packed into smaller trains, and led some passengers to miss trains because they were standing at the wrong part of the platform. In the past, there have been signs indicating where the train stops at some stations, in addition to the \"4\" and \"6\" markers next to the tracks used by train operators as stop points. Still, the overall lack of visual identifiers of train stop points on the platforms, the differing stop points during different times of day, and the location of staircases, transfer passageways and platform benches have been cited as a cause of passengers missing trains or being bunched into single cars. Beginning in 2013, additional signs were installed along G train platforms. In 2014, several improvements were implemented due to an infusion of extra funding, with G trains to be lengthened in 2019 (see below).\n\n ### Non-free transfers\n\nSave the G!, the Riders Alliance, and other organizations have also lobbied for the creation of new free out-of-system transfers to nearby stations. The most prominent is between Broadway on the Crosstown Line and either Hewes Street or Lorimer Street on the BMT Jamaica Line, which are both about three blocks away; this transfer has been previously proposed. In 2005, an MTA spokesperson stated, \"We have no intention of making that a permanent free transfer.\" This sentiment was repeated in 2013, with the MTA citing the loss of around \\$770,000 in revenue if the transfer were to become free.\n\nTemporary free transfers have been provided in the past, including one to Lorimer Street in 1999 due to suspended service over the Williamsburg Bridge on the , and again during the Summer 2014 G service suspension north of Nassau Avenue. A second transfer, from Fulton Street to the busy Atlantic Avenue\u2013Barclays Center complex in Downtown Brooklyn, was rejected by the MTA due to the long walking distance between the two stations, as well as the fact that there is a transfer to Manhattan-bound trains at Hoyt\u2013Schermerhorn Streets.\n\nA temporary transfer between Broadway and Hewes Street or Lorimer Street (along the BMT Jamaica Line) was reinstated in April 2019 due to L train service changes associated with the 14th Street Tunnel shutdown. The transfer was in effect until May 31, 2020. A temporary, MetroCard-only transfer between 21st Street and Hunters Point Avenue (along the IRT Flushing Line) was proposed, but not implemented.\n\n ## Improvements\n\n ### 2000s improvements\n\nMost stations along the IND Crosstown Line were built with multiple exits to the street. Over the years, many lower-use exits were closed (as they were in other parts of the subway), as the city was concerned that they were a magnet for criminals; this resulted in G trains along the Crosstown Line needing to stop at the locations closest to the exits. However, in July 2005, in response to community pressure, the MTA agreed to re-open an exit to the southwestern corner of South Portland Avenue to the southbound platform of the Fulton Street station. The New York Times described it as a \"minor victory\" for \"a maligned line.\" Additionally, exits to the intersection of Powers Street, Hope Street, and Union Avenue at Metropolitan Avenue were reopened on February 28, 2019, to address possible capacity constraints due to the L train shutdown. In 2019, the Court Square station received several new stairways to accommodate increased ridership from L train riders during the reconstruction of the BMT Canarsie Line tunnels under the East River, which started in late April 2019.\n\nThe G train's southern extension to Church Avenue, implemented in 2009 and confirmed permanently in 2012, was also seen as a service improvement. It reduced the need for riders from Park Slope and Kensington to make multiple train transfers to get to northern Brooklyn and Long Island City.\n\n ### Review of the G route\n\nIn 2013, at the request of State Senators Daniel Squadron and Martin Malave Dilan, the MTA conducted a review of the entire G route. The route had been maligned by riders because of its unreliability, and the review recommended a few service changes for the G. On June 9, 2014, a budget surplus in the MTA allowed these improvements to be implemented. These improvements included an increase in the number of trains per hour, from six to 7+1\u20442 trains per hour during evening rush hour; uniform stopping locations for trains, whereas previously, trains stopped at different places along the platform at different times of the day; public service announcement systems on platforms along the IND Crosstown Line; relocated benches; and new CCTV systems installed for OPTO. Such improvements eliminated the infamous \"G train sprint,\" wherein riders ran for G trains that stopped at the other end of the platforms.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2015, ridership on the G rose 17%, with approximately 150,000 riders per weekday in 2015. At the time, it was the route with the fastest growing ridership base in the entire system. These improvements also had the additional benefit of being able to accommodate the growing ridership base in gentrified neighborhoods along the line, like Park Slope, Carroll Gardens, Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant, Williamsburg, Greenpoint, and Long Island City. This was due in part to the G's weekday frequencies having become more dependable as a result of the 2013 review. Even so, the G continued to have long headways during weekends until July 2023.\n\n","h_score":1675690.2625000002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":1149401,"revid":1173189748,"description":"New York City Subway service","categories":["Independent Subway System","New York City Subway services"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Q1: What is the G train in the New York City Subway?**\nA1: The G is a rapid transit service in the NYC Subway system that runs primarily along the **IND Crosstown Line** in Brooklyn and Queens.

The second segment features a parody of the opening of Mad Men and Homer kills several celebrities, including Kate Winslet, Prince, George Clooney, and Neil Armstrong, set to the song \"Psycho Killer\" by Talking Heads. Krusty getting killed in a woodchipper references the woodchipper scene from the movie, Fargo. Other celebrities shown include Golda Meir, Edward G. Robinson, John Wayne and John Lennon, who says \"All we're saying is 'Let's eat some brains'\", a reference to the chorus of \"Give Peace a Chance\" by the Plastic Ono Band. The commercial \"Planet of the Taste\" is a parody of the 1968 film Planet of the Apes.\n\nThe final segment, \"It's the Grand Pumpkin, Milhouse\" is a parody of It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown (and was supposed to be named \"It's The Great Pumpkin, Milhouse,\" but due to legal reasons, was renamed) and contains several references to the Peanuts series. In the segment, Milhouse wears the same clothes and plays the same role as Linus van Pelt. Lisa is modelled after Sally Brown and Bart looks like Charlie Brown; he even says \"good grief\", echoing Charlie Brown's catchphrase. The main theme to Peanuts \"Linus and Lucy\" is played several times. A redesigned version of Santa's Little Helper can be seen sleeping on top of his dog house and Homer is seen sleeping on top of his house in a manner similar to Snoopy. When Marge first speaks, she uses a muted trombone. This is a parody of the \"wah wah wah\" voice that is used for adults in the various Peanuts specials. At the end of the segment, she says to the audience that they can send complaints to an address which she only says in more muted trombone noises. Milhouse' prayer to the Grand Pumpkin is similar to the Nicene Creed. The dance scene during the Halloween party is a parody of the dance scene in A Charlie Brown Christmas right down to Kang and Kodos in a nonspeaking cameo as the twins 3 and 4.\n\n","h_score":1673910.0687500001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":17530273,"revid":1154902572,"description":null,"categories":["2008 American television episodes","Animation controversies in television","Cultural depictions of Edward G.
