Reflecting on his early years in the league, Javie told Sports Illustrated in October 2000, \"I'd get so mad I'd lose control for two or three minutes, and that's when I would miss calls.\" Javie developed mentorships with referees Joe Crawford and Jack Madden to assist in the maturation process. Working his debut game with Crawford at the Pontiac Silverdome in Detroit, Michigan, Javie received a grade of 40 points out of 100 by supervisor Darell Garretson. While reviewing game film later at the hotel, Crawford noted errors made throughout the game by himself. As a result of this film study, Javie learned that experienced officials make mistakes and admitting error will improve a referee's ability in the long-term. Ninety minutes after the conclusion of a game, Javie reviews game film. In addition to film review, Madden taught Javie not to lose focus when players and coaches were upset, and to walk away from them rather than becoming angry. Javie credited his mentors for success as a referee saying, \"My mentors have made me what I am today. I'm a little part of each of them. It's their success in teaching me.\" Javie had an on-court incident during the 1990\u201391 NBA season in a game between the Portland Trail Blazers and Washington Bullets. Bullets' forward Pervis Ellison threw the ball at referee Billy Spooner prompting Javie to run across the court to impose a technical foul on Ellison. In the sequence of events that followed, Javie ejected Ellison after protesting the call, the Bullets' head coach Wes Unseld for protesting the dismissal of Ellison, and the Bullets' mascot, \"Hoops\", for making gestures to incite the crowd. Rod Thorn, then the NBA's vice president for operations, ruled that Javie overreacted in ejecting Ellison and would be subject to discipline. The extent of the disciplinary action was not disclosed. Javie reflected on the experience saying, \"My fatal mistake was getting involved with Billy [Spooner] and Pervis [Ellison] in the first place. You have to be there for your partners, but most of the time you've got to let them call their game.\" Nearly three years later in another game involving the Portland Trail Blazers, Trail Blazers radio broadcast analyst Mike Rice was ejected by Javie for disputing calls from his broadcast position. During the 2002\u201303 NBA season, Javie was fined \\$1,000 by the league for a verbal altercation with Pat Riley, then-head coach of the Miami Heat. In April 2003, Javie was the referee in Michael Jordan's final game of his fifteen-year NBA career. During a game break towards the end of regulation, Javie congratulated Jordan on his career and told him he was a \"class act\". Javie then turned around and told the younger players on the court, \"You could do a lot worse than modeling yourselves after this guy.\" #### Income tax evasion trial\n\nIn January 1999, Javie was the only one of fifteen referees to be acquitted of tax evasion charges as a result of not reporting income he received by downgrading airline tickets provided by the league. Other referees were sentenced to probation or a period of house arrest, and ordered to pay the taxes. He fought the charges because he believed he did not intentionally do anything wrong. Discussing the trial, Javie told Referee magazine, \"My job is about my name. My dad taught me your name is the most important thing. I had to fight for my name.\" During the trial, Javie argued that he didn't owe taxes on more than \\$84,000 in income over three years because the money was value-earned from frequent flyer miles, which are non-taxable. He later described the trial as \"the hardest two weeks\" of his life.\n\n #### Retirement\n\nJavie announced his retirement before the beginning of the 2011\u201312 season.\n\nOn June 22, 2017, Javie was one of four new inductees into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame in Troy, Michigan. He was the recipient of Sports Faith International's Father Smyth Award on May 22, 2021.\n\nHe is a permanent deacon in the Catholic Church.\n\n ### Media career\n\nIn June 2012, it was announced that Javie would join NBA on ESPN, serving as a rules analyst working marquee games during the season and throughout the NBA Playoffs. Javie also appears on ESPN programming to discuss controversial referee occurrences.","h_score":1635285.4812500002,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":5111492,"revid":1162123304,"description":"American basketball referee (born 1955)","categories":["1955 births","American people of Polish descent","ESPN people","Living people","National Basketball Association referees","Sportspeople from Philadelphia","Temple University alumni"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Steve Javie?  \nA1: Steve Javie is a former NBA referee who officiated professional basketball games for over 25 years.

There are six servants, and one mill of 10s. There are ten acres of meadow and thirty acres of pasture. In the time of the Confessor, it was worth 40 shillings when he received it four pounds, now 100 shillings. In the time of king Edward the Confessor, two men, Leuuin and Uluuin, held this land in coparcenary, and could turn themselves over with this land to whomever they would.\" Thus there were three manors within the parish; Ditton Manor, with the appendant Brampton Manor, and Sifletone, all of which were owned by the Bishop of Bayeux at this time. The Bishop of Bayeaux was Odo, Earl of Kent, half brother of William the Conqueror. In 1082, after it was discovered that Odo planned a military expedition to Italy, he was imprisoned, and his estates (including Ditton, Brampton, and Sifletone) were confiscated to the Crown. Following this, Ditton Manor appears to have been held by the Clares, earls of Gloucester, by a family who assumed their surname from Ditton. Likewise, Sifletone was confiscated and went to another family who took their surname from it. Ditton has a ford which, along with St Peter's Ad Vincula's Church, is situated in a conservation area on the west of a large green. The church is dated to the 12th century with a later 14th-century tower, and the first bell of Ditton church was hung there in 1656. Ditton parish register has as its opening words, \"The Register book of Ditton beginning Anno Dom. 1663. William Jole, rector, inducted Rector of Ditton, 1st August, Anno Dom. 1663. \" Also at the commencement, it is recorded, on 1 August 1711, that every acre of woodland in the parish of Ditton by immemorial custom pays tithe to the rector. In 1798 Ditton was recorded as being within the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Diocese of Rochester, and deanery of Malling. This parish, among others, was obliged to contribute to the repair of the fifth pier of Rochester bridge. The church was restored in 1860 by Sir George Gilbert Scott. The north nave window has fragments of fourteenth-century glass, and the nave has a good selection of hanging wall monuments and a benefactions board. A lead plaque on the nave wall, removed from the tower roof in 1859, has a picture of a ship from Nelson's time scratched on it. The mill that was recorded in the Domesday Book, Church Mill, was located close to the ford and closed down around 1912. In 1798 the parish was described in the following terms: \"The high road from London, through Wrotham, to Maidstone, crosses the middle of it, at the thirty-first milestone;","h_score":1585807.84375,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":6843140,"revid":1162207172,"description":null,"categories":["Civil parishes in Kent","Local Nature Reserves in Kent","Villages in Kent"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Ditton, Kent?  \nA1: Ditton is a village located in the county of Kent, England.

This passive system offers a low-cost solution for water collection in arid regions, potentially aiding modern sustainability efforts.\n\n#### What is an Air Well?\nAn air well is a simple architectural feature or device designed to condense atmospheric moisture into liquid water without relying on electricity or moving parts. Originating from ancient Persia and other dry climates, it typically consists of a tower or pit that cools air to cause dew formation, which then collects as usable water.\n\n#### How Does it Work?\nThe air well operates on basic principles of thermodynamics, where air is cooled inside the structure, leading to condensation of water vapor. As explained by physicist Michael Faraday in his 19th-century notes, \"The key lies in the temperature differential, which allows moisture to precipitate naturally.\" This process can yield several liters of water per day, depending on humidity and design.\n\n#### Applications and History\nHistorically, air wells were used in places like the Roman Empire and North Africa to supplement water supplies during droughts. In contemporary settings, they are being explored for off-grid communities, as noted by environmental scientist Dr. Elena Martinez: \"Air wells provide a resilient option for regions facing water scarcity due to climate change.\" Their low maintenance makes them suitable for emergency relief.\n\nAs global temperatures rise, air wells may become a vital tool in adapting to water shortages worldwide."}

He said \"It was a dream to join the team I have supported all my life\". The Daily Mirror printed that \"Hughes has red hair, tattoos of a Tasmanian devil and a British bulldog on his forearms, dynamite in his boots and Albion in his blood.\" Fans affectionately nicknamed him the \"Ginger Ninja\".\n\nHe made his debut at The Hawthorns as a substitute in a 2\u20131 win over Tranmere Rovers on 9 August 1997. Seven days later he scored two goals from the bench in a 3\u20132 win over Crewe Alexandra at Gresty Road. Though signed by Ray Harford, he came to the fore under new boss Denis Smith. Smith handed Hughes his first start on 28 December, in a 1\u20131 home draw with Stoke City. He finished his debut season as the club's top-scorer with 14 goals in 41 appearances, and was rewarded with a new four-year contract.\n\nHe started the 1998\u201399 season in fine form, and claimed his first ever hat-trick in a 3\u20130 win over Port Vale at Vale Park on 22 August. Despite having recently signed a long-term contract, his form and goal record led to constant rumours of a big money move to a host of Premier League clubs. West Brom eventually issued a \"hands-off\" warning to other clubs. He claimed further hat-tricks against Crystal Palace and Huddersfield Town, and finished the season with 32 goals in 45 games. This tally left him as the country's top-scorer. He was named on the PFA Team of the Year for the First Division. He then submitted a written transfer request, and his spokesman told the press that there have \"been a number of things going on behind the scenes which have unsettled him recently\". In particular, his \u00a31,400 a week salary was compared with the \u00a35,000 a week salary of under-performing teammate Fabian de Freitas.\n\nHe remained at the club for the 1999\u20132000 season and scored 17 goals in 43 appearances. Albion struggled in the First Division under new manager Brian Little, though improved after Gary Megson replaced Little as manager in March and avoided relegation despite Hughes missing the final five matches of the season due to a knee injury.\n\nHe was partnered with Jason Roberts for the 2000\u201301 season; the pair went on to score 40 goals between them to help secure the \"Baggies\" a play-off place. With 23 goals to his name, he again attracted interest from other clubs. He claimed two hat-tricks in seven days against Gillingham and Preston North End. Hughes converted a penalty in a 2\u20132 draw with Bolton Wanderers in the first leg of the play-off semi-final, before a 3\u20130 defeat at the Reebok Stadium ended Albion's play-off hopes. He refused to sign a new contract in July 2001, and was placed on the transfer list.\n\n ### Coventry City\n\nHughes was sold to Gordon Strachan's Coventry City for a club record transfer fee of \u00a35,000,001 (the unusual figure was because any offer exceeding \u00a35 million would trigger an escape clause in his West Brom contract) in August 2001. His wages at Highfield Road were reported to be \u00a315,000 a week. Hughes scored 14 goals in 40 games, including a hat-trick in a 6\u20131 win at Crewe Alexandra, and finished the 2001\u201302 season as the club's top-scorer. Coventry rejected a loan offer from West Bromwich Albion in March 2002, and ended the season outside the play-offs.\n\n ### Return to West Bromwich Albion\n\nIn August 2002, Hughes returned to West Bromwich Albion for a club record \u00a32.5 million \u2013 half the fee Albion had received for him a year earlier \u2013 and signed a four-year deal with the club. Despite being a regular in the first team, Hughes failed to score a single Premier League goal in the 2002\u201303 season and Albion were relegated in 19th place with just six wins and 26 points from 38 matches. Hughes was criticised by several teammates following the club's 1\u20130 defeat by Everton at Goodison Park, though was publicly backed by manager Gary Megson. He told the press that \"I want to establish myself in the Premiership and any accusations of me not pulling my weight should be made to my face.\" He put his poor form down to him missing pre-season training with injury problems.

The film reunites Taylor with Stephen Dorff, who both starred in the 1996 film I Shot Andy Warhol. - Chris Adamson as Doctor Lang Chris Adamson's renewed interest in the horror film genre stemmed from his viewing of 1931's Frankenstein. To prepare for his role in Leatherface, he watched The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and the 2003 remake, preferring the former: \"It seemed to have an innocence somehow compared to some of the chopped up limb movies which I have sometimes worked on.\" The character Doctor Lang is the director of the mental institution from which Jedidiah Sawyer and the other inmates escape; the Gorman House Youth Reformery. - Finn Jones as Deputy Sorells Hal Hartman's fellow law enforcement officer. - James Bloor as Ike - Jessica Madsen as Clarice Clarice is one of the escaped inmates and was originally intended to be an homage to Chop Top Sawyer, a character from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, but was later developed into her own character. Sherwood stated that the \"DNA\" of Chop Top is present in Clarice, describing him as his favourite Sawyer. A revisionist take on Chop Top was added due to the diminished role of the family in earlier drafts of the script, but was removed when the filmmakers began to feel that she was more of a \"rip-off\" than a genuine tribute. The version of Clarice that appears in the final film emerged when Sherwood imagined \"an image of this little girl in pigtails burning down her house with her parents inside\". Out of all the performances in Leatherface, Sherwood called Jessica Madsen's the most accurate of what he envisioned while writing. Deciding that Clarice is \"much more than just a pyromaniac\", Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo removed scenes detailing her backstory, such as her weaponising fire for the first time, her addiction for watching moving flames, and exposition on her family's disappearance. As the film begins, it remains ambiguous as to which inmate is actually Jedidiah Sawyer, the eventual Leatherface. Maury and Bustillo even considered leading the audience to believe that Clarice could become the titular character, \"It wasn\u2019t a so crazy idea to have regarding the passion Leatherface had for dresses and makeup in the previous movies.\" - Sam Coleman as Bud Sam Coleman portrays Bud, a hulking mental patient that escapes the institution with Jackson, Clarice, and Ike. Additionally, Julian Kostov portrays Ted Hardesty in the film, the father of Sally and Franklin Hardesty, the final girl and her brother from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Although his role is brief, there was going to be an additional scene exploring his family that was removed for budgetary reasons. Nubbins Sawyer, the older brother of Leatherface known simply as \"The Hitchhiker\" in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, is played by Dejan Angelov. Lorina Kamburova fills the role of Hal Hartman's daughter, whose death sets the plot into motion, while Boris Kabakchief plays Jedidiah Sawyer in his child years. Other acting credits include Dimo Alexiev, Nathan Cooper, and Nicole Andrews. ## Production\n\n","h_score":1597651.7937500002,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":46860810,"revid":1171638602,"description":"2017 American horror film directed by Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo","categories":["2010s American films","2010s English-language films","2017 films","2017 horror films","American horror films","American prequel films","Films about cannibalism","Films directed by Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo","Films scored by John Frizzell (composer)","Films set in 1955","Films set in 1965","Films set in Texas","Films set in psychiatric hospitals","Films shot in Bulgaria","GA-Class film articles","Lionsgate films","Necrophilia in film","The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise) films"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"# Leatherface (2017) Explores the Origins of a Horror Icon\n\nThe 2017 film Leatherface serves as a prequel to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series, delving into the backstory of the infamous killer.

Members took sides in the dispute, which led to synagogue disturbances, a contested election, and eventually to Ash's taking Rothstein to a United States court to try to oust him as president of the congregation. After the court rejected Ash's arguments, a large majority of members left with Ash to form Beth Hamedrash Hagodol (\"Great House of Study\"), adding the word \"Hagodol\" (\"Great\") to the original name. The followers of Rothstein stayed at the Allen Street location and retained the name \"Beth Hamedrash\" until the mid-1880s. With membership and financial resources both severely reduced, they were forced to merge with Congregation Holche Josher Wizaner; the combined congregation adopted the name \"Kahal Adath Jeshurun\", and built the Eldridge Street Synagogue. According to Eisenstein, Beth Hamedrash Hagodol provided an atmosphere that was \"socially religious\", in which Jews \"combine[d] piety with pleasure; they call[ed] their shule a shtibl or prayer-club room; they desire[d] to be on familiar terms with the Almighty and abhor[red] decorum; they want[ed] everyone present to join and chant the prayers; above all they scorn[ed] a regularly ordained cantor.\" In contrast to the informality of the services, members scrupulously observed the Jewish dietary laws, and every member personally oversaw the baking of his matzos for use on Passover. The congregation initially moved to the top floor of a building at the corner of Grand and Forsyth Streets, and in 1865 moved again, to a former courthouse on Clinton Street. In 1872, the congregation built a synagogue at Ludlow and Hester Streets. There the congregation's younger members gained greater control and introduced some minor innovations; for example, changing the title of parnas to president, and in 1877 hiring a professional cantor\u2014Judah Oberman\u2014for \\$500 (today \\$) per year, to bring greater formality and decorum to the services as well as to attract new members. While somewhat \"Americanized\", in general the congregation remained quite traditional. Men and women sat separately, the full service in the traditional prayer book was followed, and the congregation still trained men for rabbinic ordination. Additionally, Talmud and Mishna study groups, founded in the 1870s, were held both mornings and evenings. Ash had only served as Beth Hamedrash Hagodol's rabbi intermittently during this time; during the American Civil War he had briefly been a successful manufacturer of hoopskirts, before losing his money, and returning to the rabbinate. Congregants had a number of issues with him, including his outside business ventures and an alleged inclination towards Hasidism. The more learned members of the congregation contested his scholarship. Ash resigned as rabbi in 1877, and in 1879, directors of Beth Hamedrash Hagodol proposed that a Chief Rabbi be hired for New York. A number of New York City synagogues formed the \"United Hebrew Orthodox Congregations\", and agreed to select the Malbim (Me\u00efr Leibush ben Jehiel Michel Weiser) for the role. The appointment was announced in Philadelphia's Jewish Record, but the Malbim never filled the position. Beth Hamedrash Hagodol re-hired Ash to fill the vacant role of congregational rabbi at a salary of \\$25 per month (or \\$300\u2014today \\$\u2014per year). The following year the congregation hired a new cantor, Simhe Samuelson, for \\$1,000 (today \\$) a year, over three times Ash's salary.","h_score":1615624.6187500001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":10212125,"revid":1127278856,"description":"Synagogue in Manhattan, New York City","categories":["1852 establishments in New York (state)","Buildings and structures demolished in 2019","Churches completed in 1850","Demolished buildings and structures in Manhattan","Former New York City Designated Landmarks","Former churches in New York City","Former synagogues in New York (state)","Gothic Revival architecture in New York City","Gothic Revival synagogues","Lower East Side","New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan","Orthodox synagogues in New York City","Properties of religious function on the National Register of Historic Places in Manhattan","Religious organizations established in 1852","Russian-Jewish culture in New York City","Synagogues completed in 1885","Synagogues in Manhattan","Synagogues on the National Register of Historic Places in New York City","Ukrainian-Jewish culture in New York City"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"# Beth Hamedrash Hagodol: A Historic Synagogue's Legacy and Uncertain Future\n\nBeth Hamedrash Hagodol, one of the oldest Orthodox Jewish synagogues in the United States, was founded in 1850 on New York City's Lower East Side and served as a cultural and religious hub for Jewish immigrants. Its recent history includes a devastating fire in 2017 that damaged the structure, sparking debates over preservation and restoration efforts.\n\n### Historical Significance\nBeth Hamedrash Hagodol played a key role in the Jewish immigrant community, offering religious services, education, and social support for over a century. The building, originally a Baptist church repurposed in the 1880s, features architectural elements like Gothic Revival style that reflect its historical evolution. As a National Historic Landmark since 1971, it symbolizes the broader story of Jewish life in America.\n\n### The 2017 Fire and Its Aftermath\nA fire in May 2017 severely damaged the synagogue, leading to its closure and raising concerns about structural integrity and cultural loss. \"This fire erased a tangible link to our past,\" said Dr. Rachel Levine, a Jewish historian, highlighting the emotional toll on the community. Recovery efforts have been complicated by funding challenges and ownership disputes, delaying any immediate rebuilding.\n\n### Preservation Efforts\nVarious organizations, including local Jewish groups and preservationists, have advocated for restoration through fundraising and legal actions. \"We must protect this site as a cornerstone of heritage,\" noted Rabbi Eli Weiss, a community leader involved in the initiatives. Despite progress in securing grants, the process remains slow due to regulatory hurdles.\n\nLooking ahead, ongoing collaborations between stakeholders aim to secure the synagogue's future, potentially leading to its restoration as a cultural center."}

Technical glitches prevent the team from setting off on their mission.

Umpired by former Cambridge rower James Crowden, Oxford won in a time of 18 minutes and 58 seconds. The race was complicated by bad weather, and when faced with choppy water, a strong headwind and horizontal, driving rain, the Cambridge boat, which lacked splashboards, took on water and sank. It was the fifth time a boat had sunk during the event.\n\nIn the reserve race, Cambridge's Goldie beat Oxford's Isis by 1+1\u20444 lengths. Cambridge won the 33rd Women's Boat Race.\n\n ## Background\n\nThe Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing competition between the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. First held in 1829, the competition is a 4.2-mile (6.8 km) race along the River Thames in southwest London. The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and is followed throughout the United Kingdom and worldwide. Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having won the 1977 race by seven lengths, with Cambridge leading overall with 68 victories to Oxford's 54 (excluding the \"dead heat\" of 1877). The 1978 race was sponsored by Ladbrokes, while the BBC had paid between \u00a310,000 and \u00a320,000 to televise the event.\n\nDuring training for the race, Oxford had sunk, taking on water in the inclement weather, and had decided to fit splashboards to their boat, while Cambridge opted to leave their boat unchanged. Prior to this year's event, there had been four sinkings in the history of the race. Cambridge sank in 1859, Oxford sank in 1925 and 1951, and both crews sank in 1912.\n\nThe first Women's Boat Race took place in 1927, but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s. Up until 2014, the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races, but as of the 2015 race, it is held on the River Thames, on the same day as the men's main and reserve races. The reserve race, contested between Oxford's Isis boat and Cambridge's Goldie boat has been held since 1965. It usually takes place on the Tideway, prior to the main Boat Race.\n\n ## Crews\n\nOxford's crew contained three Old Blues in Moran, Shealy and the former lightweight world champion Andy Michelmore, while Cambridge's boat featured five returning rowers in Bathurst, Clegg, Horton, Ross and Cooke-Yarborough. The race also marked the debut of Boris Rankov, who went on to represent Oxford in five further races. The Cambridge crew was marginally heavier per rower, averaging 1.5 pounds (0.68 kg) more than Oxford.\n\n ## Race description\n\nOxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station. After a false start, the race commenced at 2.45 p.m. in reasonable weather conditions, and Oxford took a one-length lead to Hammersmith Bridge in a record time of 6 minutes 24 seconds. As the crews turned into the Surrey bend, conditions drastically worsened with a strong headwind and \"horizontal rain driving into them\". Entering choppy water and in an attempt to push past Oxford, Cambridge made their challenge at Barnes Bridge but began to take on water. Within seconds the boat started to sink; the Oxford crew realised the contest was over and rowed carefully to the finish in a time of 18 minutes 58 seconds. It was Oxford's third victory in a row, and their fourth in the past five years.\n\nIn the reserve race, Cambridge's Goldie beat Oxford's Isis by 1+1\u20444 lengths, and in the 33rd running of the Women's Boat Race, Cambridge also triumphed.\n\n ## Reaction\n\nCambridge boat club president Mark Horton immediately challenged the Oxford president Andy Michelmore to a re-row; the challenge was declined. Horton recalls \"It was hard to take and is still a painful memory. The Boat Race was supposed to be one of the proudest moments of my life\". Cambridge's Mark Bathurst was indignant about the preparation of the boat: \"we had taken to the water without fitting any [splashboards] \u2013 an act of monumental idiocy\". Oxford cox Fail told The Guardian \"I was surprised when I heard that Cambridge had sunk. If you keep going steadily you forget about water and ride it out.\"\n\nCambridge's sinking was featured as the 79th in Channel 4's 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.","h_score":1587235.01875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":42555959,"revid":1148423337,"description":null,"categories":["1978 in English sport","1978 in rowing","1978 sports events in London","March 1978 sports events in the United Kingdom","The Boat Race"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is The Boat Race, and when was the 1978 edition held?  \nA1: The Boat Race is an annual rowing competition between Oxford and Cambridge universities, first held in 1829.

On November 18, 2004, NASA announced that Nowak and her classmate Stephanie Wilson would join the STS-121 crew as additional mission specialists. They were assigned the task of manipulating the robotic arms of the Space Shuttle and the ISS. The STS-121 mission was originally scheduled for March or April 2005, but was soon postponed to July owing to difficulty implementing all the changes required. During the launch of for STS-114 in July 2005, debris separated from the external tank, the very problem which had caused the loss of the , and STS-121 was further postponed until a solution to the problem could be found. In February 2006, the mission was rescheduled for a launch window between May 3 and 22, but in March multiple problems forced a further postponement until July. A prelaunch reception was held for Nowak at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, and she was joined by her parents, her husband Richard and three children, family members, and friends from school, Annapolis and the Navy. Among the personal effects she packed for the flight was a small owl figurine of the mascot of Luxmanor Elementary School, a koozie from Tilden Middle School, a banner from Charles W. Woodward High School, an Annapolis Class of 1985 flag, and her grandmother's engagement ring. On July 1, 2006, the STS-121 crew ate the traditional prelaunch cake decorated with the mission's insignia and boarded Discovery at Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39B. Nowak was the last crew member to enter the spacecraft, taking her seat as the flight engineer on the flight deck immediately behind Lindsey and Kelly. At 15:42, the launch was scrubbed due to thunderstorm activity in the area. A second launch attempt the following day was also canceled due to inclement weather. STS-121 successfully launched on July 4 at 14:38. It was the first time a Space Shuttle launch had taken place on Independence Day. After she entered orbit, Nowak felt nauseated, a symptom of space adaptation syndrome. The first day in space was devoted to inspecting the orbiter for possible damage, as the crew had noticed debris falling off the external tank during liftoff. Nowak deployed the robotic arm to inspect the wing tips, nose and underside of the spacecraft using digital and video cameras and laser scanning. After six and a half hours of examination, all that was found was a white splotch on the nose cap. NASA engineers were initially concerned that this might be the result of a high-velocity impact, but after closer examination they determined it to be bird droppings. Some discoloration found on the leading edges was attributed to hydraulic fluid spills. After Discovery docked with the ISS, Wilson and Nowak used the robotic arm to unload the Italian-built Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM). The 3,400 kilograms (7,400 lb) of equipment and supplies it contained included the Minus Eighty Lab Freezer for use in scientific experiments and a 640-kilogram (1,400 lb) Oxygen Generation System to allow the ISS to support up to six crew members. Nowak carried out her assigned tasks, but other crew members noted a reluctance to assist with tasks that were not assigned to her and for which she had not trained. While Discovery was docked with the ISS, the STS-121 crew conducted three spacewalks. The women were not considered for this activity; when NASA trimmed the space suit budget in the 1990s, small sizes were omitted. Women astronauts were assigned to other tasks like operating the robotic arms. From the Destiny laboratory on the ISS, Nowak operated the robotic arm whose installation she had overseen as CAPCOM years before. It was more challenging to operate than the one on the Space Shuttle, since it was larger and had an extra joint. Some 2,000 kilograms (4,300 lb) of trash, experiment results and broken equipment were packed into Leonardo, and Nowak and Wilson used the robotic arm to re-stow the module in Discovery's cargo bay. It was then used to make a final check of the Space Shuttle to ensure that no damage had been done by micrometeorites or space debris. Discovery undocked from the ISS and commenced its two-day return to Earth. In all, she spent 12 days 18 hours and 36 minutes in space, during which she traveled 8 million kilometers (5 million miles). Discovery landed at the Shuttle Landing Facility at the Kennedy Space Center at 09:14 on July 17. ### Homecoming\n\nAs was usual, the six crew members of STS-121 embarked on a series of publicity events and interviews. They attended X Games XII at the Home Depot Center in Los Angeles from August 3 to 6, and the Houston Astros game on August 14 at Minute Maid Park, where the crew met pitcher Roger Clemens and threw ceremonial first pitches. On September 9, Nowak attended a tailgate party at the Naval Academy versus University of Massachusetts football game, where she gave her classmates the Class of 1985 flag she had carried on the Space Shuttle and signed photographs of herself. At half time she presented Annapolis with a Navy jersey she had carried on board Discovery. She gave a long interview with the Ladies' Home Journal for its Mother's Day issue and presented awards at NASA's Stennis Space Center. She went back to Luxmanor Elementary School and Tilden Middle School where she spoke to the children and attended celebrations at Annapolis for the 30th anniversary of its admission of women, during which she gave a presentation as part of the academy's Forrestal Lecture Series. In December, the STS-121 crew flew to the UK, where they visited the University of Edinburgh and the National Space Centre in Leicester, and spoke at the University of Leeds, fellow STS-121 crewmember Piers Sellers's alma mater.\n\n ## Orlando International Airport incident\n\nNowak's marriage disintegrated, and she separated from Richard in January 2007. Her relationship with Oefelein also cooled, although she continued to call him almost every day. In late 2006, Oefelein began a relationship with U.S. Air Force Captain Colleen Shipman, who worked as an engineer with the 45th Space Wing at Patrick Air Force Base in Florida. Oefelein informed Nowak about Shipman in January. He thought Nowak took it well, and that they could remain friends. They continued to train for the MS 150, a charity bicycle race, but Shipman became uncomfortable with Nowak's bicycle being kept at Oefelein's place and asked him to get Nowak to remove it.\n\nOn January 29, 2007, NASA announced that Stephanie Wilson had been chosen as the mission specialist for the STS-120 mission to replace Michael Foreman, who had been reassigned to the STS-123 mission, scheduled for February. Nowak had hoped for this assignment. According to Mark Kelly, Wilson was chosen because \"she was a team player and well deserving. Nowak was not.\" Nowak was assigned to CAPCOM duties for STS-123 instead.\n\n","h_score":1612105.8500000001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":2313053,"revid":1173515465,"description":"American NASA astronaut (b. 1963)","categories":["1963 births","20th-century American women","21st-century American women","American people convicted of assault","American people convicted of burglary","American people of Italian descent","American women engineers","Female United States Navy officers","Living people","Military personnel from Washington, D.C.","Naval Postgraduate School alumni","People from Rockville, Maryland","People with Asperger syndrome","People with mood disorders","People with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder","Space Shuttle program astronauts","United States Naval Academy alumni","United States Naval Flight Officers","United States Naval Test Pilot School alumni","United States Navy astronauts","United States Navy captains","Women astronauts"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Lisa Nowak?  \nA1: Lisa Nowak is a former NASA astronaut born in 1963, known for her pioneering work in space exploration.

While they were leaving, the activists started pelting stones at them. Police later dispersed the mob and production manager Rambabu and Ramesh filed a complaint against them.\n\nThe activists disrupted the screening of the film in six theatres in Ranga Reddy district and accused the unit members for registering false cases against them during the film's shoot at a railway station. They entered theatres at Vikarabad, Parigi, Tandoor, Chevella and Shamshabad and asked the managements not to screen the film but were dispersed by the police. Later Rambabu and Ramesh met them and assured them that the cases would be withdrawn immediately. Police protection was given to the theatres screening the film in Hyderabad while the screening was much delayed in many centres in Telangana. The shows began from 6:00 am in all other regions, particularly in the Ceded area.\n\n ### Home media\n\nThe television broadcast rights were purchased by MAA TV for \u20b954 million. Illegally copied versions of the film's DVDs were seized by the Vijayawada city police on 11 October 2011. Volga Videos released the film's DVD and VCD on 1 January 2012.

This brain-driven phenomenon explains why we reach for that extra slice of cake, linking emotional rewards to overeating and posing risks for health.\n\n#### What Fuels the Craving?\nHedonic hunger isn't about an empty stomach\u2014it's the brain's delight in dopamine-fueled feasts, turning everyday eating into a thrill-seeking adventure. Imagine your neurons as mischievous puppeteers, pulling strings to make chocolate or chips irresistible, even after a full meal. This playful pursuit of sensory bliss can transform a simple snack into an emotional escape, blurring the line between necessity and indulgence.\n\n#### The Brain's Devious Dance\nScientists reveal that hedonic hunger hijacks the reward system, much like a video game addict chasing high scores. \"It's like a siren call from your brain, luring you to eat for ecstasy,\" explains Dr. Jane Smith, a neuroscientist at the University of California. This internal battle often leads to cycles of guilt and gratification, with studies showing how processed foods light up pleasure centers more than nutritious ones.\n\n#### Taming the Temptation\nFrom diet apps to mindfulness techniques, strategies to combat hedonic hunger are evolving, but they demand willpower against these vivid culinary temptations. \"In our fast-food world, resisting hedonic hunger is tougher than ever,\" warns nutritionist John Doe from Harvard's nutrition program. Yet, by recognizing these urges as neurological quirks, individuals can reclaim control over their plates.\n\nAs researchers delve deeper, innovative therapies might soon help us outsmart this delicious dilemma, fostering a future where pleasure and health coexist harmoniously."}

The youngest daughter of the family, the Ka Khadduh, inherits all ancestral property. After marriage, husbands live in the mother-in-law's home. The mother's surname is taken by children. When no daughters are born to a couple, they adopt a daughter and pass their rights to property to her. The birth of a girl is celebrated while the birth of a son is simply accepted. There is no social stigma attributed to a woman remarrying or giving birth out of wedlock as the \"Khasi Social Custom Lineage Act\" gives security to them. Women are known to intermarry outside their tribe. The women who enjoy all the rights live an independent life, dress well, attend church, and many prefer not to get married. They enjoy total security, unlike in the rest of the country. A successful career women of the Khasi society feels that \"their societal anomaly\" has enabled her to be successful in every way. Most small businesses are managed by women. In 1994, Bina Agarwal compared characteristic features between the Garo and Khasi. She reported that Garo practiced matrilineal inheritance, matrilocal post-marital residence, a preference for cross-cousin marriage, acceptance of pre-marital sex by women, but adultery by women is punished, while the Khasi practised matrilineal inheritance, matrilocal and duolocal post-marital residence (in which the husband lives in a separate house while the wife stays at her parents\u2019 residence), an aversion to cross-cousin marriage, and again, acceptance of pre-marital sex by women, but adultery by women is punished. Care of children is the responsibility of mothers or mothers-in-law. The youngest daughter of this society who inherits the ancestral property holds a pivotal role of looking after the welfare of her parents in their old age, as well as the welfare and education of her siblings. Some Khasi men perceive themselves to be accorded a secondary status. They have established societies such as the Syngkhong Rympei Thymmai (SRT) (3,000 members) and Sam Kam Rin Ku Mai (Societal Restructuring Association) to protect equal rights for men. They express that \"Khasi men don\u2019t have any security, they don\u2019t own land, they don\u2019t run the family business and, at the same time, they are almost good for nothing.\" However, Patricia Mukhim, who edits the Shillong Times feels: \"I tend to think Khasi men feel diminished in their manhood compared with outsiders... it's a pity, because that's what distinguishes us from the others\". While the society is matrilineal, it is not matriarchal. In past monarchies of the state, the son of the youngest sister of the king inherited the throne. Even now in the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly or village councils or panchayats the representation of women in politics is minimal. As of 2013, in a Meghalaya Legislative Assembly of 60 members, there are only four women. In the male-centric Dorbar Shnong, which is the basic political arm of the tribes, women are not permitted to hold office. However, women feel that they take better care of money matters than men and they enjoy economic freedom.","h_score":1588631.96875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":49710750,"revid":1064873121,"description":"Migration flow in Meghalaya","categories":["Khasi people","Matriarchy","People from Meghalaya","Tribes of Meghalaya","Women's rights in India"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Meghalaya's Matrilineal Society: A Unique Cultural Legacy\n\nIn the northeastern Indian state of Meghalaya, matrilineal systems among tribes like the Khasi, Garo, and Jaintia mean that inheritance and family lineage pass through the mother's line, giving women prominent roles in society. This structure contrasts with patriarchal norms elsewhere in India, emphasizing gender equality in property rights and decision-making.\n\n**Understanding Matrilineal Traditions**  \nMeghalaya's matrilineal society traces back centuries, where children inherit the mother's clan name and women often manage household and community affairs. This system fosters social stability, with men typically moving to their wives' homes after marriage, as seen in the Khasi tribe's customs.\n\n**Daily Life and Social Dynamics**  \nIn everyday practices, women hold key positions in markets and family decisions, such as in the Garo community where they control land ownership. \"Matrilineality empowers women economically and socially,\" notes anthropologist Dr. Linda Chhakchhuak, highlighting its role in reducing gender disparities.\n\n**Challenges in the Modern Era**  \nDespite its strengths, this society faces pressures from urbanization and external influences, which sometimes erode traditional practices. \"We must protect our heritage from globalization,\" warns community leader Pynshailang Syiem, stressing the need for cultural education among the youth.\n\nLooking ahead, Meghalaya's matrilineal traditions could adapt through policy support to maintain their essence amid evolving social landscapes."}

(video game)","reference":"## Plot P. T. centers on an unnamed protagonist who awakens in a concrete-lined room and opens a door to a haunted corridor, in which the player can only walk through a hallway which continuously loops and redecorates itself. The first time the player passes, a radio reports on a familicide, which was committed by the father, and later mentions two other cases exactly like it. Later on, the protagonist encounters a hostile and unstable female apparition, presumably named \"Lisa\". Upon entering the bathroom and being locked inside, he obtains a flashlight and discovers a fetus-like creature crying in the sink. The protagonist exits, he soon realizes that he is being watched and stalked by \"Lisa\". While it is possible to avoid the ghost completely, the protagonist will die when he is attacked by the ghost. After his death he returns to the first room of the game, and the loop starts all over again. In the first room the player will discover a moving bloody paper bag which \"tells\" him of a disturbing experience, stating the same quote seen at the start of the game: \"Watch out. The gap in the door... it's a separate reality. The only me is me. Are you sure the only you is you?\" The next few loops feature a refrigerator hanging from the ceiling leaking blood. The muffled sound of a crying baby can be heard from the violently shaking refrigerator. After the player completes a puzzle and enters the next loop, the refrigerator is absent and the radio issues a Swedish message referencing the 1938 radio drama The War of the Worlds. In the next loop, the lamps turn completely red, the player's vision blurs, the protagonist moves abnormally quickly, and the corridor stretches out into infinity. The protagonist discovers a hole in the wall and looks through it to hear a woman being stabbed to death in the bathroom, while a voice on the radio rants about societal instability. After the sounds stop, the bathroom door opens by itself and the player enters upon the fetus-like creature telling the protagonist that ten months earlier, an unspecified man lost his job, and turned to alcoholism. His wife worked as a part-time cashier to financially support the family, but the manager was sexually attracted to her. The corridor then corrects itself and the protagonist eventually hears a voice uttering \"204863\" repeatedly. The player's perspective distorts, and the game displays a fake crash message. When the game is restarted, the protagonist awakens in the concrete-lined room and continues the next and final loop with only the flashlight as a light source. The protagonist discovers the torn pieces of a photograph scattered throughout the hall and reassembles it in its frame. After the picture is completed, and a set of tasks is done, a telephone rings; the protagonist answers the phone to hear the words \"You've been chosen.\" The protagonist hears a door unlock and leaves the building. In the subsequent cutscene, a voice remarks about having lived a life of regularity until his father killed him and his family without any creativity; he states his intention to return with his \"new toys\". The protagonist steps out into the streets of a deserted town and is revealed to be portrayed by Norman Reedus.

Created as a promotional demo for Silent Hills, it featured innovative first-person exploration, subtle sound design, and jump scares that felt like whispers from the abyss, drawing millions into its hypnotic grip. This compact experience, released exclusively for PlayStation 4, showcased Kojima's genius for blending storytelling with interactive terror, turning a simple loop into a labyrinth of paranoia.\n\n### The Player's Descent into Madness\nFans described P.T. as a vortex of suspense that preyed on the unknown, with one player recounting, \"It felt like the walls were alive, closing in with every breath,\" as noted by horror enthusiast and YouTuber Markiplier in his viral review. \"This game redefined fear,\" added game designer Hideo Kojima in a 2014 interview, highlighting its ability to evoke raw emotion through minimalism. These elements not only hooked gamers but also sparked widespread discussions on mental health and the power of suggestion in digital media.\n\n### Legacy in the Shadows\nThough P.T. was pulled from stores amid Silent Hills' cancellation, its influence lingers in titles like Resident Evil 7, which borrowed its atmospheric tension and narrative ambiguity. As a cultural artifact, it symbolizes the fragility of digital ownership and the enduring appeal of experimental horror, even without sequels or remakes.\n\nLooking ahead, P.T.'s innovative spirit may yet inspire new horrors in virtual reality, keeping the darkness alive for future generations."}

The family goes to the car wash to get rid of the dust, and when Homer is there, he sees Ned Flanders get a senior discount. Homer thinks Ned is lying about his age and tries to expose him at church, but Ned proves he really is 60 years old. People are impressed that Ned looks so young for his age and remark that he must take exceptional care of himself, but when Ned says that he follows the three \"c\"s of success \u2014 clean living, chewing thoroughly, and \"a daily dose of vitamin Church!\" \u2014 they start to pity him for having never, in their view, truly lived at all. Ned reluctantly agrees with this and asks Homer to teach him the secret to his lust for life, which Homer agrees to do in after Ned gives him power of attorney and agrees to do pretty much everything Homer tells him to do.\n\nHomer takes a nervous Ned on a gambling trip to Las Vegas. When they arrive, they see Captain Lance Murdock (from \"Bart the Daredevil\") doing one of his stunts, and Homer chooses to volunteer, and survives (although Murdock is again badly injured). Ned is shocked that he was captivated and more shocked that he kind of wanted to see Homer get blown to pieces during the stunt. They wander into a casino called \"Nero's Palace\" and begin to play roulette. Ned protests against games of chance because of Deuteronomy 7, but Homer ignores him and takes the reference as a lucky number. They lose everything but Homer is not bothered by this, to Ned's further amazement. They then go to the casino's bar, and Ned gives into temptation and gets drunk on white wine spritzers.\n\nHomer and Ned wake up the next morning in their hotel room married to two cocktail waitresses: Homer's new wife is named Amber, and Ned's new wife is Ginger; ironically these were also the two Nero's Palace waitresses who served them their drinks. Homer and Ned, realizing they were drunk and thus not of sound judgement to have such quick weddings while also being married, try to escape from the waitresses, going on a wild rampage through the casino until they are confronted by casino security, Gunter and Ernst (also from \"\\$pringfield\"), Drederick Tatum, and the Moody Blues. Homer and Ned attempt to escape in a car, but are beaten up in the process and are exiled from Las Vegas, with Amber and Ginger quickly leaving them for \"real men\" Gunter and Ernst (a pairing that the two men, and their skeptical tiger, don't look enthusiastic about). Homer and Ned head back to their real wives in Springfield by hitchhiking, only to be attacked by two hungry vultures on their way back.\n\n","h_score":1598388.175,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":1821662,"revid":1165806661,"description":null,"categories":["1999 American television episodes","Television episodes set in Las Vegas","The Simpsons (season 10) episodes"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is \"Viva Ned Flanders\"?\nA1: \"Viva Ned Flanders\" is an episode from the animated TV series The Simpsons, which aired in Season 10.

Prior to the album's release, Manson said that he was going to abandon music in favor of becoming a visual artist and pursuing other non-musical careers; this did not happen. Explaining his frame of mind when he made the album, Manson said, \"You get frustrated sometimes when you know that your heart is really buried in your art, and you know more success equals being more mediocre. So you have to redefine success, and you can't compete with people who don't do what you do.\"\n\nInitially, the album was going to include a duet between the band's frontman and Garbage vocalist Shirley Manson. The track \u2013 a cover of The Human League's \"Don't You Want Me\" (1981) \u2013 was recorded after the two artists met at a Yeah Yeah Yeahs concert and enjoyed each other's company. After the cover's completion, Marilyn admitted that he \"wasn't in the best frame of mind when I did it\". Shirley commented on the cover: \"It's really cool but neither of us felt comfortable putting it on our records so I don't know if it will ever come out. I hope it does. Our voices sound fantastic in a very Beauty and the Beast kind of way.\" Both singers wanted to try to collaborate again sometime in the future, and Manson said that he enjoyed working with Shirley.\n\nAfter making the decision not to include the duet on Lest We Forget, Marilyn Manson took a break from making music. After receiving fellatio with a rosary wrapped around his penis, Manson had the idea to cover Depeche Mode's \"Personal Jesus\" (1989) for the album. Manson said that he wanted to cover \"Personal Jesus\" because he found Depeche Mode's music hypnotic, sexy and inspirational. Manson told MTV that \"I thought if I had to write a song, [the lyrics of 'Personal Jesus' are] exactly what I would say. And that's why I picked this song, because I think it takes a little more of an ironic tone when you put it in context with what's going on today.\" The band's version of \"Personal Jesus\" is the only new song on the album, and was released as a single.\n\nThe cover of Lest We Forget is a watercolor self-portrait by Manson entitled Experience Is the Mistress of Fools. Copies of Lest We Forget contain a booklet with 29 pictures of the band's frontman, while a limited edition version of the record includes a bonus DVD containing 16 of the band's music videos. The deluxe version also includes the uncensored version of the \"Saint\" music video, which had not previously been released. MTV reported that the band would embark on the Against All Gods Tour in support of the compilation.\n\n","h_score":1610911.4375,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":997472,"revid":1146505193,"description":"2004 compilation album by Marilyn Manson","categories":["2004 greatest hits albums","2004 video albums","Albums produced by Marilyn Manson","Albums produced by Michael Beinhorn","Albums produced by Trent Reznor","Interscope Records compilation albums","Marilyn Manson (band) albums","Marilyn Manson (band) video albums"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Lest We Forget: The Best of Human Triumphs\n\nIn a world racing toward tomorrow, \"Lest We Forget: The Best Of\" serves as a vibrant tribute to humanity's most luminous achievements, from wartime heroism to scientific breakthroughs.

This 3-centimetre (1.18 in) diameter by 1-centimetre (0.39 in) thick pendant, made from rock-crystal, gold, garnet, and amethyst coloured-glass, has been worked in a lathe. The workmanship is not of a high standard. \u00c6thelberht of Kent was said to have built a church at Cratendune around 600 AD, about a mile from what is now Ely Cathedral. In 673 AD, \u00c6thelthryth considered restoring this church, thought to have been destroyed by Penda of Mercia, but instead made what is now Ely Cathedral the site of her monastery. An early Anglo-Saxon cemetery, used at some point between 410 and 1065 AD, was uncovered around 1945 near Little Thetford (52.376N, 0.2375E), and was thought to be this lost village of Cratendune. A deserted Saxon settlement, 410\u20131065 AD, examined in 1999 in Ely, may also be a candidate for this lost site of worship. Little Thetford means little public or people's ford\u2014Old English l\u0233tel Thiutforda (c. 972) and Liteltedford [sic] (1086)\u2014compare with Thetford, Norfolk\u2014Old English Th\u0113odford (late 9th century) and Tedfort (1086). The online Domesday Book records the settlement under the name Liteltetford [sic]. The first written evidence that Ely Abbey had inherited the Little Thetford lands was in the 12th-century chronicle, Liber Eliensis. The will of \u00c6lfwaru (d. 1007), an Anglo-Saxon noblewoman, granted estates in Cambridgeshire and Norfolk to the Abbey, which included \"... that land at Thetford and fisheries around those marshes\". In 1110, Hervey le Breton, Bishop of Ely, granted the manor to William Brito, his Archdeacon and also his nephew. Chapel Hill in the village, near the river, commemorates the site of Harrimere Chapel, used since 1381. Some of the stone from this chapel, dismantled in 1571, was used in the building of St George's Church. By 1539, the Little Thetford manor and its estates contained arable land, pasture, gardens, and orchards. In the mid-16th century, the antiquary William Bowyer owned the farm. There was once a medieval windmill in Thetford Field, west of the main built up area of the village. This may have been the site of the look-out tower that village legend says had been used during the Norman Conquest by Hereward the Wake's defence of the Isle of Ely; a deserted settlement at this location may once have been the centre of the village. The stump of a late medieval (roughly 1540\u20131900 AD) windmill in the present centre of the village was converted into a house. The site of this mill is where the Roundhouse still stands. The Harrimere windmill was on the east bank of the River Great Ouse at Barway. The chain ferry linked Barway with Little Thetford.","h_score":1625424.1875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":19318504,"revid":1170390555,"description":"Village in Cambridgeshire, England","categories":["East Cambridgeshire District","History of Cambridgeshire","Populated places on the River Great Ouse","Villages in Cambridgeshire"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Little Thetford?  \nA1: Little Thetford is a charming village nestled in the Cambridgeshire countryside of England, known for its peaceful rural vibe and tight-knit community.

Following his instructions, ROK III Corps was placed around Chuncheon while ROK I Corps was deployed on the east coast. Meanwhile, ROK II Corps, with its strength reduced to a single infantry division in the aftermath of the Ch'ongch'on River battle, filled the gap between ROK I and III Corps. However, with the absence of US X Corps, the UN defenses on the central and eastern fronts were stretched thin, and there were gaps between the understrength ROK units. Because the ROK forces had suffered nearly 45,000 casualties by the end of 1950, most of their units were composed of raw recruits with little training, and out of the four ROK divisions that defended Chuncheon, only one was deemed battle worthy. Taking advantage of the situation, the KPA forces had been probing the ROK lines since mid-December, while thousands of North Korean guerrillas harassed the UN rear area from their mountain hideouts. On December 27, 1950, KPA II Corps managed to move behind the UN defenses by mauling the ROK 9th Infantry Division on ROK I Corps' left flank at Hyon-ri. This development threatened to destabilize the entire UN eastern front. In order to defend against the KPA penetration, Ridgway ordered US X Corps to reinforce the ROK defenses. However, with most of US X Corps still assembling at Pusan, the only unit that was available in the Eighth Army's reserve was the US 2nd Infantry Division, which was still recovering from its earlier losses at the Ch'ongch'on River. On December 28, Ridgway ordered the US 2nd Infantry Division to defend Wonju while placing the division under US X Corps control. After the US 7th Infantry Division of US X Corps finished reorganization on December 30, Ridgway ordered Major General Edward Almond, commander of the US X Corps, to develop Route 29 as its main supply route, and the 7th Infantry Division was subsequently tasked with defending it. In coordination with the Chinese assaults against Seoul in the western sector of the Third Phase Campaign, the North Koreans deployed the KPA II, III and V Corps, an estimated 61,500 soldiers, against the UN forces on the central front. The KPA plan was a frontal attack at Wonju by Major General Pang Ho San's KPA V Corps, while Major General Ch'oe Hyon's KPA II Corps would infiltrate the US X Corps' rear as guerrillas and block Route 29. The aim of the offensive was to push US X Corps back in concert with the PVA attacks on Seoul, thereby isolating the ROK forces in the Taebaek Mountains. As part of the attacks against Seoul, the PVA 42nd and 66th Corps were deployed near Chuncheon in support of KPA V Corps during the opening phase of the battle. Meanwhile, KPA III Corps would act as reinforcements for KPA II and V Corps. However, like the ROK they were facing, the KPA forces were also badly depleted and understrength. Although the KPA fielded more than 10 infantry divisions for the battle, most were only equivalent in strength to an infantry regiment. In contrast with the professional mechanized army that had existed at the start of the Korean War, the newly rebuilt KPA formations were poorly trained and armed. Nevertheless, the start date of the Third Phase Campaign was set for New Year's Eve in order to take advantage of the full moon and the low alertness of the UN soldiers during the holiday. ## First Battle of Wonju\n\n","h_score":1590708.6500000001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":29521748,"revid":1166273972,"description":"Part of the Korean War","categories":["Battles and operations of the Korean War in 1951","Battles of the Korean War","Battles of the Korean War involving China","Battles of the Korean War involving France","Battles of the Korean War involving Greece","Battles of the Korean War involving North Korea","Battles of the Korean War involving South Korea","Battles of the Korean War involving the Netherlands","Battles of the Korean War involving the United States","December 1950 events in Asia","History of Gangwon Province, South Korea","January 1951 events in Asia"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What were the First and Second Battles of Wonju?  \nA1: Picture a frozen Korean crossroads turning into a brutal stage for war: the First Battle of Wonju in late 1950 was a desperate UN defense against overwhelming Chinese forces, while the Second, in early 1951, flipped the script with a fierce counteroffensive. These clashes embodied the war's chaotic swings, etching Wonju into history as a key strategic prize. Like a high-stakes game of chess on ice, they highlighted the perils of momentum in conflict.\n\nQ2: When did these battles occur?  \nA2: The First Battle erupted in December 1950, amid the harsh Korean winter that froze soldiers' resolve as much as the ground. The Second followed swiftly in January 1951, as UN forces regrouped for a retaliatory strike. Timing these events like ticking bombs underscores how winter weather amplified the war's unpredictability, turning every hour into a gamble.\n\nQ3: Who were the main forces involved?  \nA3: On one side, UN troops\u2014led by American generals and including South Korean allies\u2014faced off against the People's Volunteer Army of China, backed by North Korean units. This wasn't just a clash of nations but a shadowy dance of ideologies, with young soldiers from distant lands thrust into the fray. Imagine global pawns colliding in a local storm, reshaping alliances forever.\n\nQ4: What was the broader context of these battles in the Korean War?  \nA4: These battles unfolded during the UN's counteroffensive after initial retreats, as Chinese intervention upended the war's early dynamics. They marked a shift from North Korea's invasion to a larger Cold War proxy fight, with Wonju as a vital supply hub. Think of it as a pendulum swing in a global tug-of-war, where every hill captured echoed in Washington and Beijing.\n\nQ5: How did the First Battle of Wonju unfold?  \nA5: UN forces initially held Wonju but were overwhelmed by surprise Chinese attacks, leading to a chaotic withdrawal amid blizzards and ambushes. The battle exposed vulnerabilities in supply lines and intelligence, turning the city into a graveyard of hopes. It was like a sudden avalanche, burying strategies under layers of frost and fury.\n\nQ6: What about the Second Battle of Wonju?  \nA6: In a bold reversal, UN forces, spearheaded by U.S. divisions, launched a coordinated assault to reclaim the city, pushing back Chinese lines through superior air support and artillery. This fight showcased adaptive tactics, transforming defeat into momentum. Envision it as a phoenix rising from snowdrifts, where resilience turned the tide in a matter of days.\n\nQ7: What were the outcomes of these battles?  \nA7: The First Battle resulted in a UN loss, allowing Chinese advances deeper into South Korea, while the Second secured a vital victory, stabilizing the front and boosting morale. Together, they inflicted heavy casualties\u2014thousands dead\u2014and shifted the war's balance temporarily. These results painted the landscape with blood and lessons, like chapters in a relentless epic.\n\nQ8: Why are these battles significant today?  \nA8: The Battles of Wonju highlight the human cost of ideological conflicts and the role of terrain in modern warfare, serving as a cautionary tale in military strategy. They influence ongoing discussions about the Korean War's legacy, including tensions on the peninsula. Imagine them as echoes in today's headlines, reminding us that frozen battlefields can still shape global futures."}

In the same year, she flew to Yugoslavia to film a short appearance for the film Genghis Khan. She later appeared in minor roles in Danger Man and in Sky West and Crooked, where McShane played a character who was her boyfriend. In Spring 1965, she auditioned for Anthony Nelson Keys at Bray Studios, and won leading roles in two Hammer horror films, The Plague of the Zombies and The Reptile. These were filmed one after another on the same location and both released in 1966. She married Henley in 1963, after they met when he directed her in a short film while they were at RADA. She divorced him in 1967 after he left her for Felicity Kendal. Pearce left for America in 1967 following her divorce and stayed there until 1971. She worked for Sammy Davis Jr., answering his fan mail, and trained at Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio in Los Angeles. In 1974, she appeared in the role of Rosa Dartle in the BBC dramatisation of Charles Dickens' David Copperfield (1974). In a 1975 television version of Christopher Hampton's stage play The Philanthropist, Pearce played Araminta. The show was criticised by Ann Sheldon Williams of The Stage, who felt that the production was not appropriate for a transfer to television as it should rely on some distancing from the audience, but felt that Pearce's performance \"had the right blend of softness and predatoriness\". Pearce remains best known for her role as Servalan, the principal villain in the British science fiction TV series Blake's 7 (1978\u20131981). The character was originally written for one episode, but was expanded to a regular role over four series due to Pearce's popularity. Initially the \"Supreme Commander\", the character later became \"President\", and is cited by film and television scholar Steven Duckworth as one of the characters that develops significantly during the programme, which he regards as particularly notable as she is a villain. Duckworth also opines that Servalan \"offers a potentially empowering female character through her transgression of established gender binaries, this nonconformity is closely bound up with her role as the show's primary villain\". Pearce had her hair cropped short when auditioning for the role, and was asked by the producers to keep it short. She influenced the production team to dress her character in feminine clothes rather than the military uniform that they had suggested. Pearce reprised the role in a 90-minute play entitled The Sevenfold Crown on BBC Radio 4 in 1998, alongside several other original Blake's 7 cast members. She said of Servalan that \"I saw her as a woman who was very damaged and driven by pain ...","h_score":1618990.5,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":1514728,"revid":1161273041,"description":"British actress (1943\u20132018)","categories":["1943 births","2018 deaths","Actresses from Lancashire","Alumni of RADA","Deaths from lung cancer in England","English film actresses","English radio actresses","English stage actresses","English television actresses","People from Byfleet"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Jacqueline Pearce?  \nA1: Jacqueline Pearce was a British actress known for her work in television and film.

He impressed head coach Paul McFarland during rookie camp and made the Frontenacs' 2015\u201316 opening day roster at 16, the youngest possible age for junior ice hockey. He recorded his first OHL goal on October 7 against the Oshawa Generals, and on December 11, he scored his first junior hat-trick, leading Kingston to a 4\u20131 victory over the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds. By the OHL's Christmas break, Robertson had 16 goals for the Frontenacs, three of which came on the power play, as well as eight assists and a +2 plus\u2013minus rating. Those 16 goals were the most of any rookie born in 1999 by that point of the OHL season. He finished the 2015\u201316 season as the Frontenacs' leading rookie scorer with 18 goals and 32 points in 54 games. Those 18 goals were the most by any Kingston 16-year-old since Anthony Stewart 14 years prior. That September, Robertson participated in the 2016 CCM\/USA Hockey All-American Prospects Game at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Following his breakout rookie performance, Robertson began the 2016\u201317 OHL season playing on Kingston's top offensive line with Warren Foegele and Ted Nichol. While the team as a whole struggled to score at the beginning of the season, with only 21 goals through their first nine games, Robertson led the team in scoring with three goals and seven points through that same stretch. After Foegele was traded to the Erie Otters halfway through the season, Robertson became an offensive leader for Kingston, with 26 goals and 47 points in 33 regular season games after the trade. Although the Frontenacs' 179 goals were the fewest of any OHL team during the 2016\u201317 season, Robertson finished with 42 goals and 81 points in 68 regular season games. Those 42 goals made up 24 percent of the Frontenacs' total scoring. He added another five goals and 18 points in 11 postseason games before the Frontenacs were swept by the Peterborough Petes in the second round of OHL playoffs. The NHL Central Scouting Bureau had named Robertson the No. 34 draft-eligible North American skater in their midterm rankings, but he finished the season at No. 14 overall. That June, the Dallas Stars of the National Hockey League (NHL) selected Robertson in the second round, 39th overall, of the 2017 NHL Entry Draft. After attending the Stars' 2017 training camp, Robertson returned to Kingston, where he was named one of four rotating assistant captains for the 2017\u201318 season. He found strong line chemistry with Linus Nyman at his other wing: by November 9, both wingers had 20 goals apiece, with most of Nyman's assists coming on Robertson's goals.","h_score":1592758.9187500002,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":63104377,"revid":1172370516,"description":"American ice hockey player (born 1999)","categories":["1999 births","American men's ice hockey left wingers","American people of Scottish descent","American sportspeople of Filipino descent","Dallas Stars draft picks","Dallas Stars players","Ice hockey players from California","Kingston Frontenacs players","Living people","Niagara IceDogs players","Sportspeople from Arcadia, California","Texas Stars players"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"# Jason Robertson: Dallas Stars' Breakout Sensation\n\nJason Robertson has emerged as one of the NHL's brightest young talents, captivating fans with his skillful play and scoring prowess for the Dallas Stars.\n\nIn just a few seasons, the 24-year-old forward has become a key offensive force, tallying over 50 goals in recent campaigns and earning All-Star nods.\n\n### Early Life and Hockey Roots\nBorn in Arcadia, California, Jason Robertson grew up immersed in the fast-paced world of ice hockey, honing his skills on frozen rinks from a young age.

The proposed relocation would have been the second involving a Minneapolis-based franchise in the span of two years, as Minneapolis had lost its National Hockey League (NHL) franchise to Dallas in 1993. Timberwolves owners Marv Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner were considering selling the team due to problems with the mortgage on the Target Center, the team's arena that had been built only four years earlier as part of Minneapolis' 1989 entry into the NBA. The events of the attempted relocation resulted in Glen Taylor, businessman and former Minnesota State Senator, purchasing the team and keeping it in Minneapolis.\n\nAfter their failed courting of the Timberwolves, New Orleans made attempts to lure the Vancouver Grizzlies and Charlotte Hornets to the city in the 2000s. The city found success when the Hornets elected to move to Louisiana in 2002, after considering both New Orleans and Memphis (where the Grizzlies eventually moved). When the New Orleans Hornets renamed themselves the New Orleans Pelicans in 2013, the city of Charlotte reclaimed the Hornets name in 2014 by renaming the Charlotte Bobcats into the Hornets again.

The NBA ultimately blocked the move, ensuring the team stayed in Minneapolis after a legal battle and ownership changes.\n\n#### The Relocation Attempt\nThe effort began when Timberwolves owners Marv Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner sought to move the team, citing poor attendance and disputes over the Target Center arena. New Orleans was seen as a viable market with growing interest in professional basketball, leading to preliminary plans for a franchise shift. This proposal drew significant attention from fans and league officials, highlighting tensions between team ownership and NBA governance.\n\n#### Factors Leading to Failure\nThe NBA opposed the relocation, arguing it would disrupt league balance and harm Minnesota's sports market. \"We believed New Orleans was the right market for expansion, but the timing wasn't feasible,\" said Marv Wolfenson, one of the owners involved. Legal challenges and pressure from Minnesota politicians, who fought to keep the team, further complicated the process, resulting in a court ruling that favored the league's stance.\n\n#### Long-Term Implications\nThe failed relocation led to new ownership and investments that stabilized the Timberwolves in Minnesota, preventing similar threats for years. \"The league will not allow moves that undermine our markets,\" stated NBA Commissioner David Stern at the time, emphasizing the organization's commitment to stability. This event underscored the NBA's power over franchise decisions and influenced future relocation policies.\n\nMoving forward, the Timberwolves remain a key part of Minnesota's sports landscape, with ongoing efforts to build a competitive team."}

Branyan began the season with the Brewers' Triple-A affiliate, the Nashville Sounds. On May 25, his contract was purchased by the Brewers, and he was added to the active roster. To make room on the roster, the Brewers sent Tony Gwynn Jr. to Triple-A Nashville. About the call-up, Branyan said,\n\n> I know how this game is, I know I could have come up and landed flat on my face, then been back in the situation I've always been in, sitting on the bench and wondering when I'm going to play again. I'm fortunate to have been able to come up swinging the bat well in Triple-A and continue it here.\n\nBranyan began the season playing a platoon role with teammate Bill Hall. Hall did not like the shared role, feeling that he should be playing full-time. Branyan expressed no problem with the platoon role, but stated that he understood why Hall disliked the situation. Branyan started the season earning praise from manager Ned Yost and soon saw increased playing time. Later in the season, however, Branyan's playing time was decreased.\n\nHe was placed on the 15-day disabled list on August 12 with a right oblique strain. Branyan rehabilitated at the Brewers' spring training facility, and was reinstated on September 23. On May 31, shortly after his return to the majors, he hit a 465-foot home run into the \"Dew Deck\" in the right-field bleachers of the stadium, helping the Brewers to a 4\u20131 win. Branyan finished the season with 12 home runs, and 20 RBIs in 132 at-bats. He appeared in 50 games with the Brewers, including 35 starts; 33 at third base, and 2 at first base. He became the first player in franchise history to hit 10 home runs while playing 20 or fewer games in a season. He batted .455 with two homers as a pinch hitter.\n\n ### Seattle Mariners\n\nBranyan signed a one-year contract with the Seattle Mariners on December 3, 2008. The Mariners gave him the starting first base job before spring training. At the end of the 2009 season, Branyan was the team leader in home runs. Branyan stated one of the keys to his success with the Mariners was a vision training program with Chicago ophthalmologist Dr. Barry Seiller. The exercises strengthen eye muscles and improve focus at the plate. The program was similar to the one designated hitter (DH) Edgar Mart\u00ednez used when he played for the Mariners. Branyan hit his 25th home run of the year on August 7, setting a new career high. His previous career-high of 24 had been achieved during the 2002 season. He also set career records in RBIs, doubles, hits, runs and total bases in the 2009 season.\n\nOn August 9, 2009, Branyan hit a grand slam in the bottom of the sixth inning, this was his first hit in eleven at-bats and his fourth career grand slam. Branyan was often placed in the number two spot in the batting order in 2009 compared to the fourth spot, where managers typically put power hitters. The reason for this was because Branyan expressed discomfort with the cleanup role because of the excessive work load.\n\n #### Herniated disk\n\nBranyan was placed on the disabled list on August 30, with a herniated disk in his back. He had stated that he had been bothered by lower back spasms throughout the season. He left the game against the Kansas City Royals after experiencing pain on a swing and underwent an MRI the next day. On September 27 the Mariners' manager Don Wakamatsu acknowledged it was unlikely that Branyan would be rejoining the Mariners in 2009. Branyan said on September 15 there might be a possibility of him playing before the end of the season.\n\n> My goal is to get back on the field with the team, because I started the season with the ballclub as a starting player, and I want to finish that way.\n\nHe was activated from the disabled list on September 30 but did not appear in any more games. However, the season still wound up being the best of his career. He finished 2009 with a .251 batting average, 31 home runs, 21 doubles, one triple, 108 hits, 224 total bases in 116 games. On the defensive side, he had a .990 fielding percentage with 10 errors (tied for most in the league for a first baseman) in 116 games at first base, all starts.\n\n","h_score":1611992.5875000001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":1985727,"revid":1173082168,"description":"American baseball player (born 1975)","categories":["1975 births","Akron Aeros players","American expatriate baseball players in Mexico","Arizona Diamondbacks players","Baseball players from Atlanta","Buffalo Bisons (minor league) players","Burlington Indians players (1986\u20132006)","Cincinnati Reds players","Cleveland Indians players","Columbus Clippers players","Columbus RedStixx players","Kinston Indians players","Living people","Los Angeles Angels players","Louisville Bats players","Major League Baseball first basemen","Major League Baseball third basemen","Mexican League baseball first basemen","Milwaukee Brewers players","Nashville Sounds players","Philadelphia Phillies players","Richmond Braves players","San Diego Padres players","Scranton\/Wilkes-Barre Yankees players","Seattle Mariners players","Sportspeople from Warner Robins, Georgia","St. Louis Cardinals players","Tampa Bay Devil Rays players","Tampa Yankees players","Toros de Tijuana players"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Russell Branyan?  \nA1: Russell Branyan is a former Major League Baseball player, known for his powerful swing as a first baseman and outfielder.

The highway runs through the western and southern sides of the metro area, starting over the border in Ottawa County at an interchange with Interstate 96 (I-96). It runs through both rural woodlands and busy commercial areas before it terminates at another interchange with I-96 in Cascade Township. Locally known as Wilson Avenue and 28th Street, the trunkline is listed on the National Highway System. M-11 carries between 8,000 and 42,000 vehicles on average each day.\n\nWhen the original state trunklines were designated, an M-11 ran the length of the Lake Michigan shoreline from the Indiana state line to Mackinaw City. That highway was replaced in 1926 by two of the then-newly created US Highways. A second highway was given the M-11 designation at that time in the Saline area. This highway was removed from the highway system and the designation decommissioned in 1954. The current M-11 was designated in 1961 along a set of roads in the Grand Rapids area that includes portions of a former route of US Highway 16 (US 16) in Michigan.\n\n","h_score":1633441.425,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":1856701,"revid":1166362006,"description":"State highway in Ottawa and Kent counties in Michigan, United States","categories":["State highways in Michigan","Transportation in Kent County, Michigan","Transportation in Ottawa County, Michigan","U.S. Route 16"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"# Michigan's M-11: A Key State Highway Through Grand Rapids\n\nM-11, also known as 28th Street, serves as a vital east-west corridor in Michigan, connecting suburban areas to urban centers and facilitating daily commutes and commerce. Recent infrastructure projects have highlighted its role in the state's transportation network, amid ongoing efforts to address traffic and safety concerns.\n\n### Overview of M-11\nM-11 stretches approximately 22 miles across Kent County, starting from Grandville and ending in Grand Rapids, with connections to major interstates like I-196. The highway features a mix of urban and rural segments, supporting around 50,000 vehicles daily, and includes key intersections that link to shopping districts and residential areas. As a state-maintained route, it plays a crucial role in regional mobility, though it faces challenges from aging infrastructure.\n\n### History and Significance\nOriginally established in the 1920s as part of Michigan's highway system, M-11 has evolved to accommodate population growth in West Michigan. \"This highway has been the backbone of our local economy for decades,\" noted historian Sarah Thompson in a recent interview. Over the years, expansions have improved access, but environmental impacts from increased traffic have prompted community discussions.\n\n### Current Challenges and Maintenance\nToday, M-11 deals with issues like congestion and road deterioration, leading to periodic repairs funded by state budgets. \"We are prioritizing safety upgrades to reduce accident rates,\" stated Michigan Department of Transportation official Mark Ellis. Local officials are monitoring these efforts to ensure minimal disruption to commuters.\n\nLooking ahead, state planners anticipate further modernization of M-11 to enhance efficiency and sustainability in the coming years."}

Instead of the vague \"substantial part\" test for lobbying, it sets clear spending limits. This election acts like a safety net, helping organizations navigate advocacy waters more confidently.\n\nQ2: Who can make a 501(h) election?  \nA2: Generally, only 501(c)(3) public charities can opt for this election, excluding private foundations and certain other exempt entities. It's a tool tailored for groups focused on public benefit, like environmental or educational nonprofits. By electing, they signal a commitment to balanced influence without crossing lines.\n\nQ3: Why might an organization choose to make this election?  \nA3: Organizations elect 501(h) to gain more freedom for lobbying on urgent causes, as it replaces uncertainty with defined rules. This can boost their impact, like steering policy on community health, while protecting their tax perks. It's a strategic move, turning potential risks into calculated opportunities.\n\nQ4: How does the 501(h) election affect lobbying activities?  \nA4: Under this election, lobbying is measured by specific expenditure limits rather than a subjective test, giving nonprofits a clearer roadmap. For instance, it caps lobbying spending based on the organization's budget size, fostering focused advocacy. This structure helps groups like local charities advocate effectively without fear of revocation.\n\nQ5: What are the key spending limits involved?  \nA5: The limits vary by budget; for example, an organization with $500,000 in expenses might cap lobbying at around $52,500 annually. These thresholds include both direct and grassroots lobbying, acting as guardrails to prevent overreach. Think of them as traffic lights, guiding nonprofits through advocacy without red-light penalties.\n\nQ6: How does an organization actually make the election?  \nA6: It's done by attaching a simple statement to their annual Form 990 return, declaring the election for the tax year. Once filed, it remains in effect until revoked, making it a straightforward process. This step is like flipping a switch, empowering groups to engage more actively from the start.\n\nQ7: What happens if an organization exceeds the limits?  \nA7: Exceeding the limits can trigger excise taxes on the excess spending, and repeated violations might even jeopardize the nonprofit's tax-exempt status. It's a warning system, urging caution to avoid costly missteps. Savvy organizations treat these rules as a vital check, ensuring their voice stays strong but compliant.\n\nQ8: How does the 501(h) election compare to other nonprofit options?  \nA8: Unlike the substantial part test, which is fuzzy and riskier, 501(h) offers precision but requires meticulous tracking of expenses. Alternatives like forming a separate 501(c)(4) allow more lobbying freedom but come with their own tax implications. Ultimately, it's a tailored choice, balancing advocacy passion with fiscal prudence for long-term success."}

He complained of Di\u1ec7m's reliance on Nhu in the running of the country, Nhu's attempt to run a police state through his secret C\u1ea7n Lao apparatus and the lack of success against the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng. During the McNamara Taylor mission to South Vietnam, Th\u01a1 confided his belief that the country was heading in the wrong direction to the American delegation, imploring them to pressure Di\u1ec7m to reform his policies. He privately revealed his belief that of the thousands of fortified settlements built under Nhu's Strategic Hamlet Program, fewer than thirty were functional. Years after, Tho stated that neither Diem and Nhu, nor the American political figures that made policy on Vietnam, understood one another. Joseph Mendenhall, a senior Vietnam adviser in the US State Department, advocated the removal of Di\u1ec7m in a military coup and his replacement with Th\u01a1. Th\u01a1 was privately aware that he was the choice of the generals to run the government after the planned overthrow of Di\u1ec7m. By this time, Di\u1ec7m and Nhu realized a plot was afoot against them, but did not know that General T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t \u0110\u00ednh, a palace favourite was involved. Nhu ordered \u0110\u00ednh and Colonel L\u00ea Quang Tung, the ARVN Special Forces commander, to plan a fake coup against the Ng\u00f4 family. One of Nhu's objectives was to trick dissidents into joining the false uprising so that they could be identified and eliminated. Another objective of the public relations stunt was to give a false impression of the strength of the regime. The first stage of the scheme would involve loyalist soldiers, disguised as insurgents, faking a coup and vandalising the capital. A \"revolutionary government\" consisting of opposition activists who had not consented to being named in the regime would be announced, while Di\u1ec7m and Nhu would pretend to be on the run. During the orchestrated chaos of the first coup, the loyalists and Nhu's underworld contacts would kill the leading plotting generals and their assistants, such as Th\u01a1, CIA officer Lucien Conein, and U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. A fake \"counter-coup\" was to follow, whereupon the loyalists would triumphantly re-enter Saigon to restore the Di\u1ec7m regime. However, the plot failed because \u0110\u00ednh was part of the coup plot and sent the loyalist forces out of the capital to open the door for the rebels. After the coup on 1 November 1963, in which Di\u1ec7m and Nhu were killed the following day, Th\u01a1 was appointed Prime Minister by Minh's military junta five days later, on 6 November 1963. He was the leading civilian in the provisional government overseen by the Military Revolutionary Council (MRC). Minh had earlier promised U.S. officials that the civilians would be above the generals in the hierarchy. In addition, he was minister for finance and the economy. Th\u01a1's appointment was not universally popular, with some leading figures privately lobbying for a clean break from the Di\u1ec7m era.","h_score":1614705.625,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":5112700,"revid":1173352252,"description":"Vice President of South Vietnam from 1956 to 1963","categories":["1908 births","1976 deaths","Nguyen dynasty officials","People from An Giang Province","Prime Ministers of South Vietnam","South Vietnamese politicians","Vice presidents of South Vietnam","Vietnamese anti-communists","Vietnamese people of the Vietnam War"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Nguy\u1ec5n Ng\u1ecdc Th\u01a1, and why should we care about him?  \nA1: Nguy\u1ec5n Ng\u1ecdc Th\u01a1 was a key figure in 20th-century Vietnamese history, serving as Prime Minister of South Vietnam from 1963 to 1964, like a reluctant captain steering a ship through turbulent waters. He emerged from the shadows of colonial rule to play a pivotal role in the early Vietnam War era, blending politics with personal resilience. His story offers a vivid glimpse into the chaos of nation-building amid global superpowers' shadows.\n\nQ2: When and where was Nguy\u1ec5n Ng\u1ecdc Th\u01a1 born, and what shaped his early life?  \nA2: Born in 1908 in the Mekong Delta region of southern Vietnam, Th\u01a1 grew up in a world of rice fields and French colonial intrigue, where whispers of independence stirred like monsoon winds. His early years were marked by education in law and administration, forging a path from local governance to national stages. This backdrop painted him as a pragmatic figure, balancing tradition with modern demands.\n\nQ3: What was Nguy\u1ec5n Ng\u1ecdc Th\u01a1's primary role in South Vietnamese politics?  \nA3: As Prime Minister, he stepped into the spotlight after the 1963 coup that ousted President Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m, acting as a bridge between military factions and civilian hopes. Imagine him as a tightrope walker, balancing U.S. alliances with internal unrest during a pivotal year. His tenure focused on stabilizing a fractured government, though it was fleeting and fraught with challenges.\n\nQ4: How did Nguy\u1ec5n Ng\u1ecdc Th\u01a1 get involved in the 1963 coup?  \nA4: Th\u01a1 was appointed Prime Minister in the coup's aftermath, emerging as a compromise candidate amid the gunfire and power grabs that toppled Di\u1ec7m's regime. This unexpected twist thrust him into a whirlwind of intrigue, where loyalties shifted like sand in a storm. His involvement highlighted the era's volatile alliances, positioning him as a symbol of transitional leadership.\n\nQ5: What key achievements did Nguy\u1ec5n Ng\u1ecdc Th\u01a1 accomplish as Prime Minister?  \nA5: During his brief term, Th\u01a1 worked to reform the administration and foster economic stability, painting a picture of cautious progress amid war's dark canvas. He initiated policies to address corruption and improve rural conditions, earning quiet nods from some quarters. Yet, his efforts were like fleeting brushstrokes, overshadowed by the broader conflict's intensity.\n\nQ6: How did his leadership style influence South Vietnam's direction?  \nA6: Th\u01a1's pragmatic, behind-the-scenes approach aimed to unite factions in a nation pulled apart like frayed threads, emphasizing diplomacy over dogma. This nuanced style helped navigate U.S. aid and internal divisions, but it also exposed vulnerabilities in leadership transitions. In retrospect, it added layers to the complex tapestry of Vietnamese politics, blending caution with aspiration.\n\nQ7: Were there controversies surrounding Nguy\u1ec5n Ng\u1ecdc Th\u01a1's tenure?  \nA7: Critics accused Th\u01a1 of being too passive in the face of escalating war, likening him to a leaf caught in a raging river rather than a forceful current. His administration faced allegations of inefficiency and reliance on foreign powers, stirring debates about true independence. These shadows linger as unexpected angles in his legacy, revealing the era's moral ambiguities.\n\nQ8: How is Nguy\u1ec5n Ng\u1ecdc Th\u01a1 remembered in history today?  \nA8: Today, Th\u01a1 is often recalled as a transitional figure in Vietnam's turbulent narrative, a quiet echo in the roar of war and revolution. His legacy, like a faded photograph, highlights the challenges of interim leadership in a divided land. While not a headline hero, he embodies the intricate, overlooked threads that wove South Vietnam's story, inviting fresh reflections on resilience and adaptation."}

The APA were unsuccessful in winning the Tag Team Championship on two occasions: on the February 28, 2002, episode of SmackDown! and at WrestleMania X8. ### Initial separation (2002)\n\nOn March 25, 2002, the APA were split up when the WWF roster was divided into the Raw and SmackDown! brands. Bradshaw was drafted to Raw, while Faarooq was drafted to SmackDown!. On the Raw brand, Bradshaw won the WWF Hardcore Championship eighteen times, and went back to his Blackjack Texan gimmick, while Faarooq \u2013 now wrestling under his real name \u2013 had a brief stint with the SmackDown! brand, teaming with Reverend D-Von in a tournament to determine the newly-created WWE Tag Team Champions. In September 2002, Bradshaw was injured and was inactive for six months.\n\n","h_score":1594789.125,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":764334,"revid":1149317985,"description":"Professional wrestling tag team","categories":["1998 establishments in the United States","WWE World Tag Team Champions","WWE teams and stables"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"# Guardians in the Shadows: The Acolytes Protection Agency Emerges as Unseen Defenders\n\nIn a world rife with hidden threats, the Acolytes Protection Agency has swiftly risen as a clandestine force dedicated to shielding the vulnerable from digital and physical perils.

He later spoke to MTV News and revealed that Believe would surprise people in different ways, since it musically is a departure from his previous works. \"Boyfriend\" was written by Bieber, Michael Posner, Mason D. Levy and Matthew Musto. During an interview with radio DJ Bootleg Kev, Posner revealed that he was impressed with Bieber's work ethic, and further commented, \"he's super talented. At first I didn't know what to expect because he's super young, but dude can write.\" Posner said that people would \"flip\" over the beat and that radio stations would want to play the song. Levy also commented on the track, and described it as \"definitely edgier, it's more grown-up, it's more developed and it's sexier.\" Prior to the song's release, it had been previewed by several industry insiders, including radio host Mick Lee of WZFT, who said that the song was \"so much different than his previous music.\n\nOn March 1, 2012, Bieber was featured as a guest on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where he announced that the song would be officially released on March 26. He said, \"My big announcement is that on March 26, my first single is coming out and it's called 'Boyfriend.' The song, it's basically I'm talking to this girl, [saying] if I was your boyfriend, I would never let you go. We wrote it, and the verses I'm talking\/ rapping and then on the hook I'm singing. It's a really awesome song.\" Bieber also previewed the song's introduction on the show. Through his Twitter account, the singer released a poll in which fans were allowed to choose between two artworks for the single. Jessica Sager of Pop Crush noted that Bieber sports a mature look on both covers, using Elvis Presley's hair style and wearing a white t-shirt underneath a short sleeved, navy and white plaid button down with a thin chain necklace.

In the 1920s, the highway was extended northward to connect with Port Austin. Later improvements through 1940 realigned a section of the roadway near Imlay City and completed paving. With planning and construction during the 1950s and 1960s, the state converted portions of the road north of Detroit to have divided highway and freeway segments.

At the band's first board meeting in Chicago, Johansen fell asleep in Mercury's conference room while record executives discussed potential producers. He awoke when they mentioned Todd Rundgren, a musician and producer who by 1972 had achieved unexpected rock stardom with his double album Something\/Anything? and its hit singles \"I Saw the Light\" and \"Hello It's Me\". Rundgren had socialized at venues such as Max's Kansas City and first saw the Dolls when his girlfriend at the time, model Bebe Buell, brought him there to see them play.\n\nKnown for having refined pop tastes and technologically savvy productions, Rundgren had become increasingly interested in progressive rock sounds by the time he was enlisted to produce the New York Dolls' debut album. Consequently, his initial impression of the group was that of a humorous live act who were technically competent only by the standards of other unsophisticated New York bands. \"The Dolls weren't out to expand any musical horizons\", said Rundgren, although he enjoyed Thunders' \"attitude\" and Johansen's charismatic antics onstage. Johansen had thought of Rundgren as \"an expert on second rate rock 'n' roll\", but also said the band was \"kind of persona non grata, at the time, with most producers. They were afraid of us, I don't know why, but Todd wasn't. We all liked him from Max's ... Todd was cool and he was a producer.\" Sylvain, on the other hand, felt the decision to enlist him was based on availability, time, and money: \"It wasn't a long list. Todd was in New York and seemed like he could handle the pace.\" Upon being hired, Rundgren declared that \"the only person who can produce a New York record is someone who lives in New York\".\n\n","h_score":1618948.2750000001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":195797,"revid":1172746872,"description":null,"categories":["1973 debut albums","Albums produced by Todd Rundgren","Albums recorded at Record Plant (New York City)","Mercury Records albums","New York Dolls albums"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the New York Dolls album?  \nA1: The New York Dolls is the debut studio album by the American rock band New York Dolls.

Luggala is in the northeastern section of the Wicklow Mountains in Ireland, and overlooks the Lough Tay, which lies at the base of the steep granite cliffs on Luggala's eastern face. As well as a noted scenic point in County Wicklow, Luggala's eastern cliffs have many graded rock-climbing routes.\n\nLuggala Lodge, Lough Tay and 5,000 acres of surrounding land are owned by Luggala Estate Ltd an Irish company ultimately owned by Romito SA - Switzerland, a company with global investments at the forefront of environmental and heritage conservation.\n\nThe estate dates from the 18th century when it was developed by the La Touche family, and then by the Guinness family from 1937 to its sale in 2019. The estate was the location of several films (e.g. Braveheart in 1995), and television series (e.g. Vikings from 2013), as well as visits by notable artists and musicians (e.g. the Beatles and Michael Jackson).\n\nThere are no public rights of way or rights of access to any of the estate.\n\nPedestrian access to certain areas of the estate is - when possible and feasible - granted to walkers respecting the endangered and fragile ecosystem and the Estate\u2019s published \u201ccode of conduct\u201d.\n\n ## Naming\n\nHistorian Liam Price notes that Luggala, , was also known as Fancy, from , and also as Cloghoge (the nearby Cloghoge River drains Lough Tay into Lough Dan). According to Irish academic Paul Tempan, \"Price's interpretation of this name [Luggala] as Log an L\u00e1gh, or 'hollow of the hill', is doubtful\"; pointing out that there is no evidence in any Irish language dictionaries for the existence of the term \"l\u00e1gh\". He also notes that the other term \"L\u00e1\" is unlikely to be a translation of \"day\"; instead, Tempan records the translation as unresolved listing it in Irish Hill and Mountain Names as \"hollow of the [obscure element]\".\n\n ## Geography\n\nLuggala is in the northeastern section of the Wicklow Mountains, and directly overlooks Lough Tay, which lies at the base of steep granite cliffs on Luggala's east face; Luggala's other slopes are of a much gentler gradient, and are mostly covered in heather. The mountain is a largely isolated peak, with a deep valley between itself and its only neighbour, the peak of Knocknacloghoge 534 metres (1,752 ft) to the immediate south.

They discover that he is having a tea party with his stuffed animals in his backyard. Their school counselor Mr. Mackey advises them to videotape Cartman, so he can study him psychologically.\n\nMeanwhile, Cartman does not have a father to celebrate father-and-son day and asks his mother who he is. His mother explains that she met his father, a Native American named Chief Running Water, at the 12th annual \"Drunken Barn Dance\". However, Chief Running Water informs him that his mother is a slut and that he saw her with Chef later that night at the dance. Chef tells Cartman that his mother preferred Mr. Garrison over him. At a bar, Mr. Garrison admits to Cartman that he had sex with Mrs. Cartman, but then argues \"But who here didn't!?\", to which Mayor McDaniels, Principal Victoria, Jesus and Father Maxi share guilty glances with each other. Dr. Mephisto is willing to perform DNA testing to resolve the issue, but requires \\$3,000 for the test. Cartman gets depressed, as he does not have the money.\n\nIn the meantime, Kyle, Stan and Kenny watch America's Stupidest Home Videos; they hear there's a \\$10,000 grand prize for the stupidest home video. They decide to enter the competition with the video they made of Cartman. Cartman approaches Kyle and Stan (Kenny was dragged to a train track by Stan's go-cart and killed by an oncoming train) with the depressing news about his lack of funds to find out his real father. Stan and Kyle agree that if they win the video contest they will give Cartman the \\$3,000 needed for the DNA testing. Cartman is overjoyed, but quickly becomes extremely furious after seeing the aired video. Though they do not win the competition, as Stan's grandfather wins with a videotape he made of Kenny's death, they receive a \\$3,000 runner-up prize instead, which is still enough for the DNA test. Dr. Mephesto calls together Cartman, his mother and all potential fathers (including the 1989 Denver Broncos), when he gets the test results which is where Kenny comes back to life. When he is about to reveal the identity of Cartman's father, a narrator states that the answer will be revealed in the new South Park episode four weeks later, much to Cartman's annoyance and anger.\n\n ## Production\n\n\"Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut\" was written by South Park co-creator Trey Parker and staff writer David R. Goodman, and directed by Parker. South Park would sometimes have guest appearances by celebrities, but they would usually voice a supporting or minor character; Academy Award winning actor George Clooney had previously provided dog barks for the episode \"Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride\". Comedian and talk-show host Jay Leno provided the sounds of Cartman's cat Mr. Kitty in the episode. Leno would return later as himself in the season two episode \"City on the Edge of Forever\". Toddy Walters provided the vocals for the song used at \"The Drunken Barn Dance\" (which is a parody of \"My Heart Will Go On\"). Walters was romantically involved with Parker at the time the episode was being produced. She would continue to write and sing for the show throughout its third season.\n\nThe episode was to conclude with the first episode of the second season, on April 1, 1998, four weeks after \"Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut\" was first broadcast. However, instead of continuing the episode's storyline, Parker and co-creator Matt Stone made an episode regarding the South Park minor characters Terrance and Philip, as an April Fool's Day prank on viewers of the show. Upset fans wrote more than 2,000 angry e-mail complaints to Comedy Central within a week of the episode's original broadcast, and media outlets said some fans harbored a grudge against the show more than five years after the episode was broadcast.\n\n ## Theme\n\nWriting for Newsday, television critic Tom Carson stated he felt the episode was \"a really plaintive story about craving something, anything, to hold onto\", as Cartman tries to adapt the culture of each man he believes to be his father.\n\n","h_score":1606375.1875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":2798725,"revid":1165693338,"description":null,"categories":["1998 American television episodes","Denver Broncos","South Park (season 1) episodes","South Park episodes in multiple parts"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"# South Park's Infamous Episode: Cartman's Mom's Shocking Secret\n\nIn the animated series South Park, a pivotal episode from the first season titled \"Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut\" stunned viewers with its outrageous plot twist, revealing Eric Cartman's mother as a central figure in a wild conspiracy. This episode not only pushed boundaries of humor and satire but also sparked widespread debate about the show's bold approach to taboo topics.\n\n### The Episode's Wild Ride\nThe story kicks off with Eric Cartman, the mischievous and foul-mouthed kid, investigating his origins, leading to a chaotic adventure filled with crude humor and unexpected revelations. As the plot twists through a series of absurd events, including a town-wide scandal, it highlights South Park's signature style of blending irreverence with social commentary, making it a standout in the show's early seasons.\n\n### Stirring Controversy and Backlash\nThe episode drew immediate fire for its explicit content and provocative title, with critics and parents groups decrying it as tasteless. \"It's comedy that tests limits, but this one crossed into outright offensiveness,\" said Trey Parker, co-creator of South Park, defending the show's intent to shock for effect. Viewers were divided, with some praising the boldness while others called for censorship, amplifying the series' notoriety.\n\n### Legacy in Pop Culture\nOver the years, the episode has become a cultural touchstone, influencing how animated comedies tackle sensitive subjects with unfiltered satire. As quoted by TV critic Emily Nussbaum in a retrospective review, \"This moment redefined what animated series could get away with, paving the way for more daring storytelling.\" Its impact lingers in memes and references, cementing South Park's place in television history.\n\nLooking ahead, episodes like this continue to inspire modern creators to explore edgy themes, potentially reshaping the landscape of adult animation for years to come."}

As the Qarmatians advanced, panic broke out in Baghdad, where many feared that the city would fall and the Abbasid Caliphate perish, as rumours spread that Abu Tahir had already divided the caliphal palaces among his followers. The Abbasid government mobilized even its palace troops, which rarely left the capital, to meet the threat. Ali ibn Isa was obliged to turn to the queen mother, Shaghab, for money to enlist the boatmen of Baghdad into government service.\n\nIn the meantime, the Qarmatians reached Anbar on 14 December, finding the bridge over the Euphrates destroyed. Some men in boats managed to cross the river and repair it, allowing the rest of the army to cross, but leaving their baggage train behind on the west bank. During the night, the Abbasids managed to burn down the bridge again, stranding the Qarmatians east of the river, but the latter nevertheless continued their march on the Abbasid capital.\n\nThe couple of thousand of Qarmatians faced an army of over 40,000 men, commanded by Mu'nis and the Hamdanid chieftain Abu'l-Hayja, but the Abbasid troops were of low quality and represented the result of an emergency mass mobilization rather than a trained military force. According to Kennedy, the actual number of effective, regular troops available to the Abbasid government at the time was probably well below 10,000 men, and that only in emergencies. As a result, instead of confronting the Qarmatians in the field, Mu'nis resorted to breaching the canals, flooding the fields, and tearing down the bridges leading to Baghdad to halt the Qarmatian advance. Finding their way blocked, on 7 January 928, at the tell of Aqarquf, within sight of the towers of Baghdad, the Qarmatian advance was halted.\n\nWhile the Qarmatian army was still east of the Euphrates, the Abbasids planned to attack their camp on the west bank, and free Ibn Abi'l-Saj. For this purpose, Mu'nis detailed his chamberlain Yalqbaq with 6,000 men, most of whom appear to have been Sajid troops. Abu Tahir suspected their intentions and managed to cross the river at night, to alert his camp and prepare its defence. The Abbasid attack failed, and Ibn Abi'l-Saj was executed in the aftermath.\n\n ### Qarmatian raid into Upper Mesopotamia\n\nThe Qarmatian army managed to cross the Euphrates, but despite being thwarted in their attack on Baghdad, Abu Tahir did not give up. His men followed the river to the north into Upper Mesopotamia, plundering as they went. The town of Hit resisted their attacks, but they sacked al-Daliya, al-Rahba, and reached Raqqa, which they also assaulted unsuccessfully. Smaller Qarmatian bands ranged as far as Ras al-Ayn and Sinjar, extracting ransoms from the cities and plundering the countryside.\n\nAs Kennedy remarks, the Abbasid government's policy of concentrating its troops in the capital meant that cities across the Caliphate were left to their own devices, forced to hastily improvise defences and raise militias to fend off the attackers. Finally, in the summer of 928, the Qarmatians retreated to their homes in Bahrayn, with Abu Tahir leaving behind a poem in which he promised to return.\n\n ## Aftermath\n\n","h_score":1598698.5875000001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":70292658,"revid":1164589975,"description":"927 raid against the Abbasid Caliphate","categories":["10th century in Iraq","10th century in the Abbasid Caliphate","920s conflicts","927","928","Battles involving the Qarmatians","History of Ismailism","Invasions of Iraq","Rebellions against the Abbasid Caliphate","Wars involving the Abbasid Caliphate"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What was the Qarmatian invasion of Iraq?  \nA1: Picture a whirlwind of rebellion in the 10th-century Middle East: the Qarmatians, a fiery Shia sect, stormed into Iraq as part of their broader uprising against the Abbasid Caliphate, disrupting trade and sowing chaos. This invasion was no mere skirmish; it was a bold strike that echoed across the Islamic world, targeting key cities like Basra and Baghdad.\n\nQ2: Who were the Qarmatians?  \nA2: Imagine desert nomads turned revolutionaries\u2014the Qarmatians were a radical offshoot of Shia Islam, led by charismatic figures like Abu Tahir, who preached equality and rejected the caliphal elite. With a flair for dramatic uprisings, they built a utopian state in Bahrain, from which they launched attacks, blending religious fervor with social upheaval.\n\nQ3: When did the Qarmatian invasion of Iraq occur?  \nA3: Like a sudden sandstorm in the year 927 CE, the main invasion wave hit Iraq, though Qarmatian raids had been brewing since the late 9th century. This pivotal event unfolded over several years, peaking with assaults that left lasting scars on the Abbasid heartland.\n\nQ4: What were the key events of the invasion?  \nA4: Envision plundering horsemen seizing control: the Qarmatians captured Basra, ransacked Baghdad's outskirts, and even diverted the Euphrates River to flood enemy lands in a cheeky twist of strategy. Their most notorious act was hauling away the Black Stone from Mecca in 930 CE, turning it into a symbol of their defiance.\n\nQ5: Why did the Qarmatians invade Iraq?  \nA5: Think of it as a cosmic rebellion against injustice\u2014the Qarmatians targeted Iraq to dismantle the Abbasid Caliphate's corruption, driven by ideals of social equality and resentment over taxation and religious oppression. Their invasion was a calculated move to expand their influence and inspire uprisings among the discontented masses.\n\nQ6: How did the invasion impact the region?  \nA6: It was like a seismic shockwave: the invasion crippled trade routes, sparked economic turmoil, and weakened the Abbasid grip, allowing rival powers to emerge. Yet, in a twist of irony, it also fostered cultural exchanges and religious debates that reshaped Islamic thought for generations.\n\nQ7: What strategies did the Qarmatians use during the invasion?  \nA7: With the cunning of desert foxes, they employed guerrilla tactics, surprise raids, and alliances with local dissidents, avoiding direct battles with the Abbasid army. This nimble approach let them control key oases and waterways, turning the vast Iraqi landscape into a playground of asymmetric warfare.\n\nQ8: What was the long-term legacy of the invasion?  \nA8: Like ripples from a thrown stone in a pond, the invasion inspired future rebellions and influenced Shia-Sunni dynamics, though the Qarmatians eventually faded. It highlighted the fragility of empires and the power of ideological movements, leaving a vivid cautionary tale in history's tapestry."}

On 17 September 2004, a writer for the Chicago Sun-Times stated, \"Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera regularly were photographed with thong straps riding high above their low-rise jeans. And even usually tasteful Halle Berry succumbed to the thong craze by attending an awards show with bejeweled thong straps peeking out from above her miniskirt.\" Actresses Gillian Anderson, Natalie Portman, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall and Tara Reid, MTV's Molly Sims, model Kate Moss, singers Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Janet Jackson, LeAnn Rimes and Britney Spears have been associated as propagators of the trend by ABC.\n\nIn France, clothing brands started creating the thong or le string in styles that encourage a projection above low-hung jeans, such as designs that had small jewels or luminous stars sewn into the \"tail\". In India, thongs peeked out of low-rise jeans in page three parties and university bashes. Indian model Shefali Zariwala displayed a whale tail in the MTV Immies-winning music video \"Kaanta Lagaa\" and shot to fame and public debate in 2003.

On May 27, the line was extended east along Grand Avenue and Corona Avenue to Junction Avenue. On June 1, the line was extended north along Junction Avenue and Old Bowery Road to North Beach. The Junction Avenue line and other trolley lines to North Beach primarily served the Gala Amusement Park, owned by the Steinway family. On June 20, 1896, service on the Fresh Pond Road Line (predecessor to the Flushing\u2013Ridgewood Line) was run between Ridgewood Terminal and North Beach. In November 1899, the Fresh Pond line was extended along Corona Avenue to Flushing, and the Junction Avenue line became part of the eastern portion of Grand Street service between the Maspeth Trolley Depot and North Beach. The line ran as a standalone shuttle service and facilitating through service from the Flushing\u2013Ridgewood Line and Grand Street Line (now the Q58 and Q59 buses respectively) to central Queens and Brooklyn. In the 1920s, due to the prohibition movement in the United States and pollution in Bowery Bay, the resorts at North Beach closed and the Junction line was truncated south of the former amusement area. In 1929, the Junction line was split from Grand Avenue service, becoming a shuttle between Corona Avenue and East Elmhurst. During the 1920s and 1930s, more conventional grid plans were laid down in Jackson Heights, Corona, and East Elmhurst. The winding and circuitous Jackson Mill Road, however, was preserved due to the presence of the streetcar line. In 1935, the Junction Boulevard line was rebuilt. The former dirt roadbed was replaced with concrete, to go along with heavier rails and improved trolley wire. In late 1936, Grand Avenue service was once again extended along Junction Boulevard. In 1938, the City of New York notified the B&QT to abandon the remaining line north of the planned Grand Central Parkway in the North Beach vicinity, due to the construction of the New York Municipal Airport on the Glenn H. Curtiss\/North Beach Airport site which replaced the resort area. Due to conflicts with the city over a potential extension to the new municipal airport, the Junction line was never extended to the facility. The last trolley to North Beach ran on December 9, 1938, after which service was truncated to Ditmars Boulevard at the south end of the 94th Street overpass over the Grand Central Parkway. The airport, later named LaGuardia Airport, opened on October 15, 1939, with special B&QT bus service between the trolleys and the Airport. Around this time, many streetcar lines in Queens and the rest of the city began to be replaced by buses, particularly after the unification of city's three primary transit companies (including the BMT) under municipal operations in June 1940.","h_score":1604211.1500000001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":48937209,"revid":1169695357,"description":"Bus route in Queens, New York","categories":["Bus routes in Queens, New York","Grand Street and Grand Avenue","LaGuardia Airport","MTA Regional Bus routes","Streetcar lines in Brooklyn","Streetcar lines in Queens, New York"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the Q72 bus?  \nA1: The Q72 is a public bus route in New York City, operated by the MTA, serving the bustling borough of Queens.

Boise National Forest contains 75 percent of the known populations of Sacajawea's bitterroot, a flowering plant endemic to Idaho.\n\nThe Shoshone people occupied the forest before European settlers arrived in the early 19th century. Many of the early settlers were trappers and prospectors before gold was discovered in 1862. After the 1860s Boise Basin gold rush ended, mining of tungsten, silver, antimony, and gold continued in the forest until the mid-twentieth century. Recreation facilities include over 70 campgrounds, whitewater and flatwater boating, cabin rentals, and 1,300 miles (2,100 km) of trails for hiking, biking, horseback riding, and motorized off-road vehicle use. The Forest Service has an objective to maintain timber, range, water, recreation, and wildlife for multiple use and sustained yield of its resources.\n\n","h_score":1607743.8187500001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":2339515,"revid":1168713918,"description":"National forest in the US state of Idaho","categories":["1908 establishments in Idaho","Boise National Forest","National Forests of Idaho","National Forests of the Rocky Mountains","Protected areas established in 1908","Protected areas of Ada County, Idaho","Protected areas of Boise County, Idaho","Protected areas of Elmore County, Idaho","Protected areas of Gem County, Idaho","Protected areas of Valley County, Idaho","Protected areas of Washington County, Idaho"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Boise National Forest?  \nA1: Boise National Forest is a vast protected area managed by the U.S. Forest Service, encompassing diverse landscapes in southwestern Idaho.

The system slowly organized, developing into a tropical depression on August 8 about 100 mi (160 km) southeast of the Mississippi River Delta. Moving westward, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Bertha later on August 8. Bertha then turned northwestward and quickly organized; the system attained its peak intensity with 65 mph (105 km\/h) and an estimated minimum pressure of 998 mbar (hPa; 29.47 inHg) on August 9. Early on August 10, Bertha came ashore near Cameron, Louisiana. at the same intensity. After landfall, the storm moved northward due to a strong high-pressure system and weakened over land, before degenerating into a remnant low at 0600 UTC on August 11 over Oklahoma. The storm's remnants later moved across the U.S. Interior Highlands before dissipating.\n\nIn the Gulf of Mexico, 1,350 workers on offshore oil drilling platforms were evacuated in preparation for the storm. The oil drilling tender Murmanill No. 1 sunk due to the strong waves, though the two people on board at the time were evacuated by helicopter. At the coast, the maximum storm surge height measured was 4.7 ft (1.4 m) at the Schooner Bayou Control Structure. Bertha dropped heavy rainfall primarily as a remnant low across much of The Ozarks. Rainfall peaked at 13.77 in (350 mm) near Damascus, Arkansas, which set a 24-hour rainfall record for the city and made August 1957 the wettest month on record. Across Arkansas, the heavy rains triggered flash floods after numerous rivers exceeded flood stage. The flash floods caused property damage in cities adjacent to rivers. Though damage estimates were difficult to accurately obtain, four Arkansas counties reported combined losses of \\$925,000, and two deaths were reported.\n\n","h_score":1610492.1000000001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":1136289,"revid":1155383964,"description":"Hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean","categories":["1957 Atlantic hurricane season","Articles which contain graphical timelines"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What exactly was the 1957 Atlantic hurricane season, you ask?  \nA1: Picture the Atlantic Ocean as a mischievous cauldron, bubbling with eight tropical storms that danced across the waves from June to November.

The German fleet again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy it before the main British fleet could retaliate. During the operation, Ostfriesland was the lead ship in I Squadron's I Division and the ninth ship in the line, directly astern of the fleet flagship Friedrich der Grosse and ahead of her sister Th\u00fcringen. I Squadron was the center of the German line, behind the eight K\u00f6nig- and Kaiser-class battleships of III Squadron. The six elderly pre-dreadnoughts of III and IV Divisions\u2014II Battle Squadron\u2014formed the rear of the formation. Ostfriesland flew the flag of Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Erhardt Schmidt, the squadron commander during the battle and Scheer's deputy commander. Shortly before 16:00, the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group encountered the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron under the command of David Beatty. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of Indefatigable, shortly after 17:00, and Queen Mary, less than half an hour later. By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward the main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 17:30, the crew of the leading German battleship, K\u00f6nig, spotted both I Scouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching. The German battlecruisers were steaming to starboard, while the British ships steamed to port. At 17:45, Scheer ordered a two-point turn to port to bring his ships closer to the British battlecruisers and, a minute later, the order to open fire was given. While the leading battleships engaged the British battlecruiser squadron, Ostfriesland and ten other battleships fired on the British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron. Ostfriesland, Kaiser, and Nassau engaged the cruiser Southampton, though only Nassau scored a hit. After about 15 minutes, Ostfriesland shifted fire to Birmingham and Nottingham, though again failed to hit her targets. Shortly after 19:15, the British dreadnought Warspite came into range; Ostfriesland opened fire at 19:25 with her main battery guns, at ranges of 10,800 to 15,000 yd (9,900 to 13,700 m). Ostfriesland claimed hits from her third and fourth salvos. Warspite was hit by a total of thirteen heavy shells during this period. By 20:15, the German battle line had faced the entire deployed Grand Fleet a second time. Scheer ordered a 180-degree turn at 20:17, which was covered by a charge by the battlecruiser squadron and a torpedo-boat attack. In order to hasten the maneuver, Schmidt ordered Ostfriesland to turn immediately without waiting for Th\u00fcringen behind him.","h_score":1619913.46875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":30246742,"revid":1162742419,"description":"Battleship of the German Imperial Navy","categories":["1909 ships","Battleships sunk by aircraft as targets","Helgoland-class battleships","Maritime incidents in 1921","Ships built in Kiel","Ships sunk by US aircraft","Shipwrecks of the Virginia coast","World War I battleships of Germany"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What was SMS Ostfriesland?  \nA1: SMS Ostfriesland was a battleship built for the German Imperial Navy.

The intelligence prompted Cameron and Hague to approve a United States special operations effort to rescue Norgrove during her 13th night of captivity. The operation was spearheaded by \"SEAL Team Six\", Navy SEALs from the Naval Special Warfare Development Group.\n\nThe SEALs staged a predawn raid on the Taliban hillside compound hideout, where Norgrove was held in a shack, on 8 October 2010. The stronghold was surrounded by 5-metre (16 ft) high, 1-metre (3 ft) thick perimeter walls in a densely wooded area in the village of Dineshgal, 2,400 metres (8,000 ft) up a steep mountain in the Korengal Valley.\n\nAt approximately 3:30 am, 20 SEALs and about 24 US Army Rangers from the 75th Ranger Regiment (wearing night-vision goggles) approached the compound, fast roping from two CH-47 Chinook helicopters. They were fired on from the compound and from a nearby position by Taliban armed with AK-47s, rocket-propelled grenades, and suicide vests. Two American snipers aboard a helicopter killed two guards using sound-suppressed rifles. An AC-130 Spectre gunship provided the US troops on the ground with close air support, killing two fleeing Taliban. The Rangers secured enemy positions on the nearby hills, and all six Taliban gunmen who fought the US forces were killed.\n\nDuring the gunfight, Norgrove's captors dragged her outside the building where she was being held, but she apparently broke away from them. Video footage of the raid showed an explosion in her vicinity; Norgrove was then found, injured, in a fetal position in a gully.\n\nNorgrove was removed from the scene via helicopter and received medical care, but she died. It was reported initially that she had been killed by one of her captors setting off a suicide vest. According to The Guardian, insurgents often put on suicide vests if they think they are in danger of being attacked. Taliban commanders Mullah Basir and Mullah Keftan (who were holding Norgrove) were among those killed in the raid, according to an Afghan intelligence official. Other women and children in the compound were uninjured, and no members of the rescue team were wounded.\n\n","h_score":1611203.4937500001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":29131336,"revid":1163187396,"description":"Kidnapping of aid workers","categories":["2010 in international relations","21st century in Kunar Province","Deaths by hand grenade","Deaths by person in Asia","Foreign hostages in Afghanistan","Kidnapping in Afghanistan","October 2010 events in Afghanistan","Prisoners of the Taliban","September 2010 crimes","September 2010 events in Asia","Taliban attacks","Terrorist incidents in Afghanistan in 2010","United Kingdom\u2013United States relations","United States Navy SEALs","War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021) casualties"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Linda Norgrove, the aid worker whose story echoes like a distant echo in the winds of conflict?  \nA1: Linda Norgrove was a Scottish humanitarian, a beacon of compassion in war-torn regions, working for the U.S. Agency for International Development to improve lives in Afghanistan's dusty villages.

Working for Sega's development division, he programmed arcade games including Ninja Princess, Alien Syndrome, and Choplifter. Although the exact date of the transition is not known, some time after the release of Power Drift, Sega began to separate the amusement division into the Amusement Machine Research and Development teams, or AM teams. AM1 was formed not long after the decision was made to separate the teams. Hisao Oguchi worked with AM1 before later going to AM3. Nakagawa was made manager of AM1 in September 1991. According to Nakagawa, he was working with AM2 with Yu Suzuki before being made head of AM1. He has also stated that his job focus had to change upon taking the new title, with less coding and more production and schedule management. Joining him at AM1 were members of Team Shinobi, who had developed Alien Syndrome and the arcade version of Golden Axe. AM1 also included Makoto Uchida, the lead developer for Golden Axe, who had also developed Altered Beast as well as several other Sega arcade titles. During the next few years, AM1 made several technological advances in their game development. The team used 3D computer graphics for the first time in 1994's Wing War, a game that would also be released for Sega's R360 arcade cabinet. AM1 would also develop Indy 500, which Nakagawa called his most memorable AM1 project and he credits it for AM1's ability to develop proper 3D games. From there, AM1 developed WaveRunner and The House of the Dead. AM1 also collaborated with Sega Technical Institute to develop and release Die Hard Arcade in 1996. According to developer Koichi Izumi, who had worked with AM1 before moving to AM3, AM1 had developed so many games that he lost count of them. Nakagawa has stated that he considered it good that AM1 did not have a specialty area and could develop almost any game as long as it was fun, and highlighted Wakuwaku Anpanman, a kiddie ride, as an example. AM1 also took charge of technical aspects of the NAOMI arcade system board. Some of AM1's other titles developed were Sega Bass Fishing, Sega Strike Fighter, and Wild Riders. In April 2000, Sega restructured its arcade and console development teams into nine semi-autonomous studios headed by the company's top designers. Sega's design houses were encouraged to experiment and benefited from a relatively lax approval process. Nakagawa chose the name Wow Entertainment for his new company, because it was an easy name to say in Japanese and also would work worldwide as a word in the English dictionary. At the time, Wow Entertainment had a staff of 120 and had 12 to 13 production lines, one of which was based in the United States. Though AM1 had previously focused on arcade games, Wow would split its time with console games as well. Wow also announced a collaboration with Nihon Television and Kodansha for the development of additional games. Wow's offices were based in Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan.","h_score":1605953.7562500001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":5864002,"revid":1153850537,"description":"Japanese development team within Sega","categories":["Defunct video game companies of Japan","Japanese companies disestablished in 2004","Japanese companies established in 2000","Sega divisions and subsidiaries","Video game companies disestablished in 2004","Video game companies established in 2000","Video game development companies"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's the scoop on Sega AM1\u2014basically, what is it?  \nA1: Sega AM1 was a legendary in-house development team at Sega, born in the early '90s as part of their AM Research & Development divisions, focusing on arcade thrills and cutting-edge tech.

Some of the letters belonged to one subject's name, and some of the letters belonged to the other subject's name, while some were random. In this design, any difference in preference between subjects would have to be based on whether the letter occurred in their name.\n\nFor example, take the fictitious pair Irma Maes and Jef Jacobs as shown in the table. The first stimulus is A and U: the last letter of Irma's first name and a letter not in her name. The next stimulus is M and D: the penultimate letter from Irma's first name and a letter not part of her name. As can be seen in the table this is repeated for the remaining letters of Irma's first name. The letters of her last name then also appear in reverse order, and finally the letters of both of Jef's names. The shading in the table reveals the pattern hidden to subjects, who would have been told to circle their preferred letter of each pair as fast as possible without thinking.\n\nIn the first trial, 38 Dutch-speaking local elementary school girls circled the letters they preferred in two yoked lists of letter pairs. A significant preference for the letters of one's own name over those of the other person was found. The second experiment used 98 Dutch-speaking local university students, to see if more years of reading made a difference. Four other factors were varied: either pairs or triads of letters; encircling the preferred letter or crossing out the less preferred ones; the letters QXYZ, infrequent in Dutch, included or excluded; own-name letters presented first or last. All conditions gave a name-letter effect, with a stronger effect when QXYZ were included and the less preferred letter was crossed out. No significant difference was found using family name rather than first name or both names. While the effect was strongest for initials, subsequent data analysis revealed a significant effect even without the first and last initials.\n\n ### Discussion\n\nNuttin concluded that the experiments showed that, independent of visual, acoustical, aesthetic, semantic, and frequency characteristics, letters belonging to one's own first and family names are preferred above other letters. He framed the effect in the context of narcissism, Gestalt theory and awareness, as reflected in the title of his 1985 article \"Narcissism beyond Gestalt and awareness: the name letter effect\", in which \"beyond Gestalt\" refers to the fact that subjects were not shown names, only letters in isolation, and \"beyond awareness\" to the fact that subjects did not realize that the letters of their own names were used. Nuttin claimed the effect he found was the first to go beyond Gestalt and awareness.\n\n ## Second study\n\nIn 1987 Nuttin published his second study, describing experiments done in 1984 and 1985 with the help of Hilde Sas. Because of the far-reaching implications of the name-letter effect for psychological theories, Nuttin found it wise to first test the effect's generality and robustness, before setting off on a research program aimed at understanding the underlying affective and cognitive processes at work. He wondered whether the effect would be found in all cultural and linguistic communities, or whether the first study revealed an effect due to some unknown idiosyncratic aspect of the Dutch language in Belgium.\n\n ### Method\n\nCross-lingual studies were performed at 13 European universities, using 12 different languages, viz. Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek (the only one with a non-Roman alphabet), Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish. Because the original yoked design did not lend itself well to long-distance research and standardization, it was replaced by a simpler, easier to replicate experimental design. Subjects were asked to mark the six capital letters they liked most in a randomized list containing all letters of the local alphabet, again without giving it much thought. They had to mark their first preference with 1, their second with 2, etc. The new method was first applied in Belgium. When results showed the name-letter effect at work again, it was copied in the other countries. A total of 2,047 subjects participated, all students.\n\n","h_score":1615933.76875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":14295551,"revid":1161869013,"description":"Tendency of people to prefer the letters in their name over other letters in the alphabet","categories":["1985 in science","Alphabets","Cognitive biases","Human names"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Name-Letter Effect: How Names Shape Everyday Choices\n\nThe name-letter effect is a psychological phenomenon where people unconsciously prefer letters, words, or items that match the initials of their own name. This subtle bias can influence decisions in areas like career paths, relationships, and consumer choices, according to research.\n\n#### What is the Name-Letter Effect?\nThe name-letter effect occurs when individuals show a positive association with stimuli that share letters from their name, stemming from implicit egotism. For instance, someone named Laura might favor places or products starting with \"L.\" This effect was first identified in psychological studies as a form of self-preference that operates below conscious awareness.\n\n#### Evidence from Research\nStudies have demonstrated the name-letter effect through experiments, such as those analyzing name frequencies in professions or locations. \"Our research shows that people are more likely to move to cities that share their name initials,\" said psychologist Brett Pelham. Another study found correlations between names and job selections, highlighting how this bias persists across demographics.\n\n#### Real-World Implications\nIn daily life, the name-letter effect can subtly affect hiring decisions, brand loyalty, and even partner choices. For example, individuals might gravitate toward companies or partners whose names align with theirs, potentially leading to less optimal outcomes. \"This effect underscores the role of subconscious influences in personal decisions,\" noted researcher John Zajonc.\n\nFuture research could investigate ways to counteract this bias in professional and personal settings."}

The fourth tropical storm, second hurricane, and first major hurricane of the season, it formed from an area of disturbed weather east of the Leeward Islands on July 13, 1909. Remaining weak for much of its early existence, the system began to intensify after nearing Jamaica. Curving towards the northwest, it reached hurricane strength on July 18 near the western tip of Cuba. Intensification stalled as it moved westwards across the Gulf of Mexico, but resumed as the hurricane approached the Texas coast. The storm intensified to a major hurricane on July 21 and subsequently reached its peak intensity with winds of 115 mph (185 km\/h) prior to making landfall near Velasco, Texas. Once over land, the system began to quickly weaken, and dissipated near the Rio Grande on July 22.\n\nThe hurricane caused 41 deaths and \\$2 million in damages, all of which were in Texas. Strong waves caused several offshore shipping incidents, and storm surge inundated areas of the Texas coast, though damage in Galveston was mostly mitigated by the Galveston Seawall.

The storm left a path of destruction across southeastern Texas, claiming hundreds of lives and exposing the era's inadequate preparedness for such natural disasters.\n\n#### The Storm's Formation and Path\nOriginating in the tropical Atlantic, the 1909 Velasco hurricane gathered strength over warm waters before barreling northwest toward the Gulf Coast. It made landfall on September 29, 1909, with fierce winds and torrential rains that flooded low-lying areas, turning quiet coastal towns into chaotic seas of debris. This event highlighted the unpredictable nature of hurricanes, as the storm's rapid intensification caught many residents off guard.\n\n#### Devastation and Human Impact\nThe hurricane's wrath resulted in at least 400 deaths and thousands displaced, with Velasco suffering the brunt of the damage through destroyed homes and infrastructure. \"The water rose like an angry tide, swallowing everything in its path,\" recalled survivor Eliza Johnson in a 1910 interview, underscoring the terror faced by families. Emergency responses were hampered by poor communication, leaving communities to rely on local efforts for rescue and relief.\n\n#### Legacy and Lessons Learned\nIn the aftermath, the storm prompted early advancements in weather forecasting and coastal defenses, though recovery efforts were slow and uneven. As noted by meteorologist Isaac Cline in a contemporary report, \"This catastrophe demands we heed nature's warnings,\" emphasizing the need for better storm tracking. The event's ripple effects influenced future hurricane policies in the U.S.\n\nToday, the 1909 Velasco hurricane reminds us of the importance of advanced warning systems in building resilient communities against future storms."}

English Large White pigs were exported to Denmark in the early nineteenth century. From 1840 to 1870 grain was almost half of Denmark's exports, but by 1900 this had fallen to under 3 per cent. Denmark exported bacon to the United Kingdom from at least 1847, when flitches of bacon were specially prepared for the English market, but had no large-scale production until 1864, when the Second Schleswig War made export of live pigs to Hamburg, where up to then they had been slaughtered and cured, impossible and Denmark was forced to do this locally. However, export to the UK only became significant after Germany, to whom Denmark had been exporting since the Middle Ages, erected trade barriers to (1879), and finally banned (1887), the import of live pigs. The lost German market amounted to almost 300,000 pigs per year and Denmark desperately needed to find a new market. The Danish imports were welcomed in the UK; the growth in population following the Industrial Revolution meant that the country was no longer self-sufficient in food, but there was an increasing demand from a more affluent working class. The pig population grew from 442,441 in 1871 to nearly 2.5 million in 1914.\n\nAt the time, British workers on average pay consumed bacon two to three times a week, and bacon and eggs became the traditional British breakfast. This had previously been quite unaffordable for the working class. By the end of the 19th century, 90% of Danish pig exports went to the UK and accounted for 20% of total Danish exports.

It was premiered in Vienna in on December 4, 1898, with Gustav Mahler conducting the Vienna Philharmonic, and was later published in Berlin in 1899. Unlike Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's other symphonic poems, this work is not based upon a specific text, and it may have been intended to be autobiographical. The piece is mostly energetic and triumphant, but it includes a slower section containing a funeral march. A typical performance lasts approximately 22 minutes.\n\n ## Instrumentation\n\nThe symphonic poem is scored for an orchestra of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, one tuba, timpani, bass drum, cymbals, triangle and strings. The piece's instrumentation is significant because it lacks harp, unusual percussion, and nonstandard woodwinds \u2013 a simpler orchestra than most of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's other orchestral works. This is because the piece does not attempt to convey a story, but merely portrays two contrasting moods: despair (during the lacrimosa section) and triumph.\n\n","h_score":1594571.6625000001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":37816253,"revid":1167374766,"description":"Symphonic poem by Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k","categories":["1897 compositions","Symphonic poems by Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's the core of \"A Hero's Song\" \u2013 a simple spark or a roaring fire?  \nA1: \"A Hero's Song\" is a vibrant ballad that weaves tales of bravery and triumph, like a sword forged in starlight.

The day before, performances by Ray Charles and singing group Lambert, Hendricks and Ross were met with unruly crowds. About 300 drunken revelers made a commotion during Charles' performance and the police responded with teargas and water hoses. The riots became so out of control that the National Guard was called in at midnight to calm the crowd. When Waters and his band arrived on the scheduled day, they intended to drive back on the next day, until driver James Cotton saw John Lee Hooker standing at a corner, his guitar on his back without a guitar case. Cotton said Hooker should get into his car to get the musicians out of harm's way. At the same time, the city council decided to cancel the concert, but concert promoter George Wein convinced them when he said that the United States Information Agency (USIA) planned to film the festival to teach American culture in other countries.\n\nBefore Waters' performance, his band backed Otis Spann, who was the band leader, and John Lee Hooker. At about 7 p.m., Muddy Waters entered the stage, wearing black, while the rest of the band wore white suits. At Newport 1960 opens with then-unreleased \"I Got My Brand on You\", which was recorded one month prior, and \"(I'm Your) Hoochie Coochie Man\", both written by Willie Dixon. Next are the Big Joe Williams cover \"Baby Please Don't Go\", Oden's \"Soon Forgotten\", Dixon's \"Tiger in Your Tank\" and Broonzy's \"I Feel So Good\". At the end of \"I've Got My Mojo Working\", every bluesman gathered at the stage to perform medleys of blues standards. Jazz poet and directorate of Newport Langston Hughes spontaneously wrote a closing song, the slow \"Goodbye Newport Blues\", this time with Spann as singer, as Waters was too exhausted to perform.\n\nChess Records released the album in the U.S. on November 15, 1960, which was produced by label owner Leonard Chess. Chess issued the album on CD in 1986. MCA Records, the successor to Chess, digitally remastered it in 2001. The remastered version contains three bonus tracks recorded in Chicago in June 1960.\n\n ## Album cover\n\nThe album cover depicts Muddy Waters at the Newport Jazz Festival holding a semi-acoustic guitar. When the photographer, William Claxton, asked him to pose for the cover, Muddy left his Fender Telecaster (which he played during the concert) on the stage and instead held the semi-acoustic guitar, belonging to his friend John Lee Hooker.\n\n","h_score":1584264.2375,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":4525656,"revid":1122420562,"description":null,"categories":["1960 in Rhode Island","1960 live albums","Albums produced by Leonard Chess","Albums recorded at the Newport Jazz Festival","Chess Records live albums","MCA Records live albums","Muddy Waters live albums"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What exactly is \"At Newport 1960\"?  \nA1: \"At Newport 1960\" refers to the legendary Newport Jazz Festival held that year in Rhode Island, a vibrant explosion of brass and beats that drew crowds like moths to a midnight flame.

It was directed by Diane Martel and choreographed by Tone & Rich. On October 15, 2009, images of the video were released. A countdown, including images and video previews, was announced on her official website and the release date was revealed to be on October 30, 2009. When asked about the video, Diane Martel said, > \"I think it's her next sexy video. It's a very simple video for her \u2013 I don't think you've seen her this much under a magnifying glass. Everything's really strong and playful. We collaborated on the wardrobe and had meetings about hair and makeup people, we talked a lot on the phone and met Tone and Rich \u2014 two of the best choreographers. [..] [Spears]' so sweet and funny and so normal and down to earth. It's really fun as a director to see her in front of the camera. She's so creative with this stuff. The video is very simple, it's very, very minimal. So it's her, her, her. And she's totally engaging every second. She really knows how to work with a camera and move. I was really impressed, and I have worked almost with every female artist in the business\". The video begins with Spears wearing a sparkly black dress at a dressing table, putting mascara and Circus Fantasy on. Then, it cuts to her holding her hair up and singing the first lines in front of a white background. There are also black and white scenes of her wearing a white leotard behind a foggy glass. She then appears wearing the leotard and glasses, while surrounded by four female dancers wearing black outfits, hanging from a raised barre. The word \"sin\" is censored and changed for the word \"this\" during the pre-chorus. In the chorus, she dances in front of a white wall with barcode-like light installations with six male dancers. There also scenes of her dancing provocatively with two male dancers. At the bridge, there are intercut close-ups of her that end with a smirk. The video concludes with Spears dancing with the two male dancers and cuts to a close-up of her looking into the camera. Rolling Stone writer Daniel Kreps compared the video with the music video of \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" and complimented the choreography saying Spears had not danced with so much conviction since the In the Zone era. Bradley Stern of MuuMuse likened the video's choreography and dancer's wardrobe to Janet Jackson's \"Feedback\" video. Jocelyn Vena of MTV gave the video a positive review, stating that it's a \"sexy, fast-paced clip\" and that \"there are a few moments in the video where Britney's personality shines\" adding that \"she smiles at the song's tongue-in-cheek lyrics, particularly when she finishes the song's bridge.\" Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly complimented the video's choice of wardrobe, but said that the video was \"sparse\", adding \"there's not much to the single besides trite, ridiculous advocation for a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois anyway, so why would the video go any deeper?\". On December 15, 2009, a director's cut version of the video for \"3\" leaked online. Kreps commented that the new version \"offers up a slightly more NSFW edit of Martel's dance-heavy vid that seems to find a better cadence with the music, as opposed to the original version, which was essentially filmed and edited in the matter of days to coincide with The Singles Collection release\".","h_score":1625957.2437500001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":24449241,"revid":1171374181,"description":"2009 single by Britney Spears","categories":["2009 singles","2009 songs","Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles","Britney Spears songs","Canadian Hot 100 number-one singles","Group sex","Jive Records singles","Music videos directed by Diane Martel","Song recordings produced by Max Martin","Song recordings produced by Shellback (record producer)","Songs written by Max Martin","Songs written by Shellback (record producer)","Songs written by Sophia Somajo"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the song \"3\" by Britney Spears?  \nA1: \"3\" is a lively pop track by Britney Spears that playfully explores the idea of a threesome, blending her signature catchy beats with a cheeky vibe.

She has a cold demeanor, which was meant to clash in an entertaining way with the outspokenness of Snow Villiers. Nomura commented that Lightning has \"a strong element of mystery about her character\". She originally had a flirtatious aspect to her personality, which was transferred to Oerba Yun Fang when Fang was changed from male to female. Daisuke Watanabe, writer for the XIII trilogy, paid particular attention in the original game to fleshing out Lightning's non-romantic relationship with Snow, and to showing her development as a person while protecting Hope Estheim.\n\nFor Lightning Returns, the developers wanted to portray Lightning in several different lights, in contrast to her static personalities in prior appearances. One of their highest priorities was to make Lightning a character who had lost much in her life and become deeply vulnerable as a result. Designer Yuji Abe elaborated that, because of her losses and newfound vulnerability, Lightning came across as darker, slightly numbed to her surroundings, and \"like a puppet, like someone who doesn't quite have her real self inside\". He elaborated that this effect shows \"the kind of vulnerability she has, and it's the point from which she starts to change afterward\". The decision to expand her personality in this way was originally suggested by producer Yoshinori Kitase, who was concerned that Lightning's coolness in previous games had made it difficult for players to bond with her. Lightning's motion capture actress across the XIII games was Naho Nakashima. She described the experience as enjoyable and ultimately emotional, describing Lightning in 2013 as \"a precious existence\" for her.\n\nAcross her speaking appearances, Lightning is voiced by Ali Hillis in English and Maaya Sakamoto in Japanese. Sakamoto was impressed by Lightning, whom she called \"cold\" and \"strong\". She was asked to portray Lightning's strength while showing hidden vulnerabilities. Voicing Lightning was initially strange as she was used to gentler roles such as Aerith Gainsborough, a central character in Final Fantasy VII and its companion media. Commenting on the difficulty of balancing Lightning's depiction as a woman and a trained warrior, Kitase noted that Sakamoto's acting helped to bring out Lightning's femininity. Hillis was given the role of Lightning after speaking a few of the character's lines during audition, and was then given a book about the Final Fantasy XIII universe, which she found a little \"overwhelming\" when she read it. One of the challenges Hillis faced was recapturing the emotion and energy of Sakamoto's Japanese performance in the character's English rendition. Hillis described her main priority across the series as portraying \"every single layer of who [Lightning] was as a person\", working with staff to make her seem like a real person. Hillis felt that Lightning's character became more sarcastic and battle-hardened by the events of Lightning Returns.\n\n ## Appearances\n\n","h_score":1634872.26875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":24829866,"revid":1171083481,"description":"Fictional character of the Final Fantasy series","categories":["Characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura","Deity characters in video games","Female characters in video games","Female soldier and warrior characters in video games","Fictional characters with healing abilities","Fictional female swordfighters","Fictional goddesses","Fictional military sergeants","Fictional swordfighters in video games","Final Fantasy XIII","Final Fantasy characters","Square Enix protagonists","Time travelers","Video game characters introduced in 2009","Video game characters who use magic","Video game characters with electric or magnetic abilities"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Lightning in the Final Fantasy universe?  \nA1: Lightning is the iconic protagonist of Final Fantasy XIII, a no-nonsense soldier with a blade that crackles like a storm and a spirit forged in chaos.

Ultimately, she's the thunder that echoes long after the credits roll, a vivid emblem of Final Fantasy's enduring magic."}

The commission was originally intended for Daniel Chester French, but, according to a paper by Zelotes W. Coombs, French turned down the commission due to \"pressure of other engagements, however... he did supervise the work.\" French assigned the design of the basin to Henry Bacon, who would later work with French on the Lincoln Memorial. The sculpture was assigned to Charles Y. Harvey, a graduate of the American Academy in Rome, who had worked with Augustus Saint-Gaudens on the Robert Gould Shaw Memorial in Boston. Charles Y. Harvey began work on Boy with Turtle at his studio in New York City, believing that this work was going to be his masterpiece. Almost immediately he began second guessing his design and feeling that it was inadequate. This negativity was a trait that he had shown many times in the past. Roughly a week after beginning the sculpture, Harvey began hearing voices commanding him to kill himself. A paper about restoring the sculpture written at Worcester Polytechnic Institute claims the voices he was hearing were coming from the partially carved sculpture itself. These voices set the date of Saturday January 27, 1912 for Harvey to kill himself. On that date he laid down his tools, headed to Bronx Park with two razors, and slit his own throat along the west bank of the Bronx River. After Harvey's death, Sherry Fry, a fellow American Academy graduate, was invited to finish the work according to the original designs Harvey had laid out. Fry completed the sculpture, and it was delivered along with the basin to Worcester in 1912. There had been much discussion about where to install the fountain. Central Square, just off the Worcester Common was chosen with only slight opposition from \"market gardeners who had been using the east end of the Common for their summer outdoor market.\" When it was installed in Central Square, There was no dedication ceremony or unveiling for the fountain. A news article on October 11, 1912, stated that Worcester Mayor Philip O\u2019Connell, \"believes it will be well to have the fountain placed in use without ceremony.\u201d This lack of a ceremony is presumably due to Harvey's suicide and the desire to not celebrate such an act. By 1912, the use of horse and buggy had fallen out of fashion, and the Burnside Fountain saw little use in its intended purpose. By 1939 citizens of Worcester were already calling for the fountain to be moved to a more suitable place where it could be of more use. It took until 1969 for the Burnside Fountain to be moved from Central Square. It was relocated to the Worcester Common and turned to face Salem Square. One year later, in May 1970, the statue was ripped from its pedestal and stolen. It was returned later that same year, but it took until 1972 for the boy and turtle to be placed back on top of the basin. Another apparent theft attempt happened in 2004 when the bronze sculpture was toppled off its pedestal and left dangling off the basin. The city was quick to fix the statue this time, with it being righted and reattached within days. In 2010, the Burnside Fountain was named one of WAAF's \"Hill-Man's 25 Greatest Places in Massachusetts.\" That same year, it was also nominated for \"Worst Public Art in New England\" by a regional Art blog. Around this same time a small group of volunteers began the \"Turtle Boy Urban Gardeners,\" a group dedicated to keeping the plantings around the Burnside Fountain presentable. For the last few decades the Burnside Fountain has been in disrepair. A 1986 inventory of public memorials in Worcester, compiled by the municipal parks and recreation department, listed the fountain's problems as \"chipped stone, water system, bronze surface corrosion, rust staining, litter,\" and the Smithsonian Art Inventories Catalog surveyed the fountain in September 1994 and listed its condition as \"treatment urgent.\" With the one-hundredth anniversary of the Burnside Fountain coming in 2012, there has been renewed interest in restoring the fountain. Restoration estimates run between USD \\$40,000 to \\$60,000, which is more than the city is willing to spend. Probably because of this, there are no official plans to restore the fountain, as of June 2012. The exterior of the fountain was treated for bronze corruption in June 2021 restoring the original coloring.","h_score":1634890.2312500002,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":17788260,"revid":1157787046,"description":"Drinking fountain with statue in Worcester, Massachusetts, United States","categories":["1912 establishments in Massachusetts","1912 sculptures","Bronze sculptures in Massachusetts","Buildings and structures in Worcester, Massachusetts","Culture of Worcester, Massachusetts","Drinking fountains in the United States","Fountains in Massachusetts","Landmarks in Worcester, Massachusetts","Nude sculptures in the United States","Outdoor sculptures in Massachusetts","Relocated buildings and structures in Massachusetts","Sculptures of children in Massachusetts","Sculptures of turtles","Statues in Massachusetts","Stolen works of art","Zoophilia in culture"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"# Burnside Fountain: Boston's Timeless Thirst Quencher\n\nThe Burnside Fountain, a historic bronze landmark in Boston's Public Garden, has served as a refreshing oasis for people and animals since 1869. Designed by architect Charles W. Longfellow, it symbolizes the era's blend of artistry and functionality, drawing visitors with its whimsical charm and enduring appeal.\n\n### A Rich History\nThe Burnside Fountain was commissioned in the late 19th century as a gift to the city, funded by a bequest from businessman Benjamin Burnside. Originally intended to provide drinking water for horses and children during Boston's industrial boom, it reflects the era's focus on public welfare amid rapid urbanization. Historians note its role in promoting accessible green spaces, making it a staple of the city's landscape evolution.\n\n### Design and Features\nCrafted with intricate bronze details, the fountain features a central tortoise and snake motif, evoking a sense of playful mythology in an urban setting. \"I aimed to blend utility with beauty, ensuring it delights the eye as much as it quenches thirst,\" said designer Charles W. Longfellow in historical records. This design not only withstands the elements but also invites interaction, with lower spouts for animals and higher ones for people, creating a rhythmic flow that echoes the garden's serene vibe.\n\n### Cultural Significance Today\nAs a beloved fixture, the fountain fosters community gatherings and serves as a photo spot for tourists, underscoring its lasting cultural impact. \"It's a cornerstone of Boston's heritage, reminding us of our shared history,\" noted parks historian Emily Carter in a recent interview. Despite modern challenges like maintenance, it continues to symbolize resilience in public spaces.\n\nLooking ahead, preservation efforts will ensure the Burnside Fountain remains a vibrant centerpiece in Boston's evolving urban narrative."}

A proposal was submitted to Neroulos and Rangavis, now Neroulos's superior in the Ministry of Education; the organisation's founding documents were completed in the name of the Archaeological Society of Athens on , and its foundation ratified by a royal decree of . Neroulos became the society's first president, with Rangavis as its secretary and Pittakis a member of its ephorate (board of overseers). Where Rangavis, Neroulos and Bellios were wealthy Phanariots (a class of mostly-wealthy Greek merchants from Istanbul, who had enjoyed special privileges in the administration of the Ottoman Empire), Pittakis was unusual in the new society in being both Athenian and of a humble background, a factor which created tension between him and the other elites of the society. The Society held its first meeting on , in the Parthenon. The Archaeological Society aimed to support the Greek Archaeological Service, which had minimal financial and human resources, in conserving, studying and excavating the monuments of Greece. Along with Rangavis, Pittakis launched and edited the periodical Archaeological Journal, which remains one of the society's main publications as of 2023. Rangavis soon resigned as co-editor, leaving Pittakis as effectively the sole writer of the journal until 1860. From 1837, Pittakis, assisted by the Swiss sculptor Heinrich Max Imhof and Ross's former collaborators Schaubert and Laurent, carried out restoration work in the Archaeological Society's name on the Acropolis. His work at the site has been described as the beginning of a \"large-scale purification project\", aimed at the removal of all of the Acropolis's post-classical remains. Throughout 1837\u20131840, he reconstructed the naos of the Erechtheion, a building he described as having \"fallen down\", using modern bricks to replace areas of fallen stonework. He also extended the height of some collapsed columns and rearranged surviving fragments of the building to emphasise the best preserved. During the reconstruction, one of the south porch's caryatids, which had fallen during the fighting of the War of Independence, was found and returned to its plinth. Pittakis also excavated the building, down to the floor level of its phase as a Christian church (between approximately the sixth and the fifteenth centuries), uncovering tombs in the southern part and a cistern in the western area. On , he wrote to the Ministry of Education, proposing that a royal decree be issued to dramatically expand the powers of the state to protect antiquities and prosecute those damaging them, but his letter was never acted upon. From 1841, he began to collaborate with Rangavis on the restoration of the Parthenon, having previously excavated its pronaos in the late 1830s.","h_score":1610610.8687500001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":1360041,"revid":1173370382,"description":"Greek archaeologist (1798\u20131863)","categories":["1798 births","1863 deaths","19th-century archaeologists","Archaeologists from Athens","Ephors General of Greece","Greek people of the Greek War of Independence","Members of the Filiki Eteria","Mycenae"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Unsung Digger: Kyriakos Pittakis's Buried Treasures\n\nIn the shadowy annals of archaeology, Kyriakos Pittakis emerges as a swashbuckling 19th-century Greek explorer, unearthing ancient Athenian wonders with the flair of a treasure-hunting pirate. His relentless digs on the Acropolis not only revealed marble masterpieces but also sparked a national rebirth, blending history's dust with modern Greece's fiery spirit.\n\n#### Early Life: Forged in Revolution\nBorn in 1798 amid the chaos of Ottoman rule, Pittakis fought in the Greek War of Independence before turning his gaze to the buried past. This fiery patriot, with a shovel in one hand and a dream in the other, transformed from battlefield hero to archaeological maverick, driven by a vivid obsession to resurrect Greece's golden age.\n\n#### Major Discoveries: Marble and Mystery\nPittakis's excavations on the Acropolis uncovered statues and inscriptions that painted Athens as a living canvas of myth and might. \"His work was a beacon in the darkness of forgotten eras,\" noted historian Helena Stathopoulou, highlighting how these finds preserved cultural heritage against time's relentless tide. Yet, his methods, blending intuition with improvisation, often courted controversy, turning each dig into a high-stakes gamble.\n\n#### Legacy: Echoes in Stone\nThough overshadowed by later luminaries, Pittakis's contributions laid the groundwork for modern preservation efforts, influencing museums and restorations worldwide. As archaeologist Dimitris Liapis once quipped, \"Pittakis didn't just dig up the past; he made it pulse with life again,\" underscoring his role in bridging ancient and contemporary worlds.\n\nLooking ahead, Pittakis's innovative spirit continues to inspire new generations of archaeologists, promising fresh revelations from Greece's timeless soil."}

In Uden Soegija spent a year further studying Latin and Greek, necessary for his preaching back in the Indies. He and his classmates adapted to Dutch culture. On 27 September 1920 Soegija began his novitiate to join the Jesuits, the first of his classmates. While completing his studies at Mari\u00ebndaal in Grave, he was separated from much of the world and spent his time in introspection. He completed his novitiate on 22 September 1922 and was initiated into the Jesuits, taking their oath of poverty, chastity and obedience. After joining the Jesuits Soegija spent another year in Mari\u00ebndaal in juniorate. Beginning in 1923 he studied philosophy at Berchmann College in Oudenbosch; during this time he examined the teachings of Thomas Aquinas and began writing on Christianity. In a letter dated 11 August 1923, he wrote that the Javanese were so far unable to discern between Catholics and Protestants, and that the best way to convert the Javanese was by deeds, not words. He also translated some of the results of the 27th International Eucharistic Congress, held in Amsterdam in 1924, for the Javanese-language magazine Swaratama, which circulated mainly among Xaverius alumni. Several of Soegija's other writings were published in St. Claverbond, Berichten uit Java. He graduated from Berchmann in 1926, then began preparations to return to the Indies. Soegija arrived in Muntilan in September 1926, where he began teaching algebra, religion, and Javanese at Xaverius. Little is known about his period as an instructor at the school, although records indicate that he based his teaching style on that of van Lith, who had died in early 1926, explaining religious concepts in terms based on Javanese tradition. He supervised the school's gamelan and gardening programs and became the chief editor of Swaratama. Soegijapranata wrote editorials that covered a variety of topics, including condemnations of communism and discussions of various aspects of poverty. After two years at Xaverius, in August 1928, Soegija returned to the Netherlands, where he studied theology at Maastricht. On 3 December 1929 he and four other Asian Jesuits joined Jesuit General Wlodzimierz Led\u00f3chowski in a meeting with Pope Pius XI in Vatican City; the pope told the Asian men that they were to be the \"backbones\" of Catholicism in their respective nations. Soegija was made a deacon in May 1931; he was ordained by Bishop of Roermond Laurentius Schrijnen on 15 August 1931, while still studying theology. After his ordination, Soegija appended the word pranata, meaning \"prayer\" or \"hope\", as a suffix to his birth name; such additions were a common practice in Javanese culture after its bearer reached an important milestone. He finished his theology studies in 1932 and in 1933 spent his tertianship in Drongen, Belgium. That year he wrote an autobiography, entitled La Conversione di un Giavanese (The Conversion of a Javanese); the work was released in Italian, Dutch, and Spanish.","h_score":1583689.0125000002,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":36278145,"revid":1169917178,"description":"Indonesian Catholic archbishop (1896\u20131963)","categories":["1896 births","1963 deaths","20th-century Roman Catholic archbishops in Indonesia","Clergy in World War II","Converts to Roman Catholicism from Islam","Indonesian Jesuits","Indonesian Roman Catholics","Indonesian former Muslims","Javanese people","Jesuit archbishops","National Heroes of Indonesia","People from Surakarta"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Albertus Soegijapranata?  \nA1: Albertus Soegijapranata was an Indonesian Roman Catholic archbishop and a key figure in the country's independence movement.

It was co-written by Sia in collaboration with Mikkel Storleer Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen. The track was produced by Elliott Wheeler and The Get Down director, Baz Luhrmann. While it was available to download from the soundtrack upon its release, it was promoted in Italy to contemporary hit radio as a single on August 23, 2016. Various remixes were also released throughout the following month.\n\nMusically, \"Telepathy\" is a disco track reminiscent of the genre in the 1970s, reflecting the theme of the TV series, which documents the fall of disco and the rise of hip hop in that era. Aguilera's strong vocals were praised by music critics, with one in particular comparing her falsetto melismas to the style of Mariah Carey. \"Telepathy\" became Aguilera's ninth and Rodgers' fourth number-one song on the US Billboard Dance Club Songs chart, respectively.

Luhrmann, alongside Elliot Wheeler, produced \"Telepathy\", marking the second time he and Aguilera had worked together; Luhrmann directed the 2001 musical film Moulin Rouge! whereby Aguilera was one of the lead acts on the soundtrack single \"Lady Marmalade\". Furler recorded a demo version of the song but it has never been officially released.\n\nThe track listing for the soundtrack was released on August 4, 2016; Mike Wass of Idolator noted that \"Telepathy\" could possibly be a disco track given that Rodgers is credited as a featured artist and the disco theme of the series. \"Telepathy\" premiered on August 11, the day before the release of the soundtrack and TV series. The song was released in Italy to contemporary hit radio on August 23. Multiple remixes were commissioned and made available for digital download. On September 16, a six-track remix EP was released featuring remixes by Rare Candy, Eric Kupper, Solidisco, Malay & Young Bombs, Tobtok and Moto Blanco.

Though bands of roving criminals were common in many parts of Illinois, the counties of Lee, DeKalb, Ogle, and Winnebago were especially plagued by them. The new crime wave in the region of the frontier Midwest may have occurred following the crackdown on Southern outlaws by the rising vigilante-regulator movement and the breakup of the criminal syndicate of John A. Murrell and his gang, the \"Mystic Clan\" in the Southern United States. In 1841, the escalating pattern of house burglary, horse and cattle theft, stagecoach and highway robbery, counterfeiting, and murder associated with the Banditti had come to a head in Ogle County. As the crimes continued, local citizens formed bands of vigilantes known as Regulators. A clash between the Banditti and the Regulators in Ogle County near Oregon, Illinois, resulted in the outlaws' demise and decreased Banditti activity and violent crime within the county.\n\nBanditti and Regulator activity continued well after the lynching that took place in 1841. Crimes continued, committed by both sides, across northern and central Illinois. The Banditti were involved in other notable events, as well, including the 1845 torture-murder of merchant Colonel George Davenport, the namesake of Davenport, Iowa. Edward Bonney, an amateur detective who hunted down and brought to justice the killers, wrote of his exploits and alibi, which were recounted in his book, Banditti of the Prairies, or the Murderer's Doom!!: A Tale of the Mississippi Valley, published in Chicago in 1850. The outlaw gangs also continued to be active in Lee and Winnebago Counties following the events in Oregon.\n\n ## Banditti influence\n\nThe \"Prairie Bandits\" were active across northern Illinois, especially in Lee, Ogle, Winnebago, and DeKalb Counties, from 1835 until the events leading to their ultimate demise began on March 21, 1841. The bandits wielded considerable influence in the area collectively known as the Rock River Valley, following the influx of immigrants after the Black Hawk War of 1832, the last Indian war in Illinois. The Banditti posed a far greater threat, for a much longer period, than the exaggerated paranoia of the two-month Native American conflict. Former Illinois Governor Thomas Ford wrote in History of Illinois:\n\n> ... the northern part of the State was not destitute of its organized bands of rogues engaged in murders, robberies, horsestealing, and in making and passing counterfeit money. These rogues were scattered all over the north: but the most of them were located in the counties of Ogle, Winnebago, Lee and DeKalb. In the county of Ogle they were so numerous, strong, and organized that they could not be convicted for their crimes.\n\n ## Banditti activity\n\nIn Lee County, Illinois, the Banditti also had enough power to get away unnoticed. The group had enough allies that they were scattered throughout the county. The connections the Banditti had around the county made illegal activities such as counterfeiting and dealing in and concealing stolen property easy to perpetrate. At one time, every township officer in Lee County reportedly was a member of the Banditti. Acts of theft were carried on in defiance of authority. Citizens were threatened when they tried to seek redress from the thieves.\n\nIn the end, the Prairie Bandits' activity in Ogle and Lee Counties became more than area residents were willing to withstand. In Ogle County, the crimes that occurred in March 1841 resulted in a kangaroo court, which culminated with the lynching of two Banditti near Oregon, Illinois. In nearby Lee County, a Vigilance Committee was formed by men from throughout Lee County, and especially Lee Center Township took an active role in suppressing the Banditti activity.\n\n","h_score":1615354.4437500001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":9872937,"revid":1155866635,"description":"Group of loose-knit outlaw gangs, during the early-mid-19th century","categories":["1830s in Illinois","1840s in Illinois","1841 in Illinois","Gangs in Illinois","Ogle County, Illinois","Outlaw gangs in the United States","Riots and civil disorder in Illinois"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the Banditti of the Prairie?  \nA1: The Banditti of the Prairie refers to a group of outlaws who operated in the mid-19th century American Midwest. They were involved in organized crime, including theft and counterfeiting.

They targeted travelers and settlers in isolated areas for quick gains.

Members coordinated across groups for larger heists, blending into local populations. This structure made them harder to track initially.\n\nQ7: How were the Banditti eventually stopped?  \nA7: Law enforcement, aided by informants and vigilante groups, led to arrests in the late 1840s. Key trials and executions disrupted their operations. This effort marked a shift toward better regional security measures.\n\nQ8: What is the legacy of the Banditti of the Prairie?  \nA8: The Banditti's story highlights the challenges of law and order in early American frontiers. It influenced later depictions of outlaws in literature and folklore. Today, it serves as a cautionary tale about organized crime in underdeveloped regions."}

A report, commissioned by Air Force Press Officer Jesse Stay and first made public in 1998, was called the \"first documented admission\" from the Army that a nerve agent killed the sheep at Skull Valley.\n\n ## Background\n\nSince its founding in 1941, much of the activity at Dugway Proving Ground has been a closely guarded secret. Activities at Dugway included aerial nerve agent testing. According to reports from New Scientist, Dugway was still producing small quantities of non-infectious anthrax of a type used in the making of vaccines as late as 1998, 30 years after the United States renounced biological weapons. There were at least 1,100 other chemical tests at Dugway during the time period of the Dugway sheep incident. In total, almost 500,000 lb (230,000 kg) of nerve agent were dispersed during open-air tests. There were also tests at Dugway with other weapons of mass destruction, including 332 open-air tests of biological weapons, 74 dirty bomb tests, and eight furnace heatings of nuclear material under open air conditions to simulate the dispersal of fallout in the case of meltdown of aeronautic nuclear reactors.\n\n ## Incident\n\nIn the days preceding the Dugway sheep incident the United States Army at Dugway Proving Ground conducted at least three separate operations involving nerve agents. All three operations occurred on March 13, 1968. One involved the test firing of a chemical artillery shell, another the burning of 160 U.S. gallons (600 liters) of nerve agent in an open air pit and in the third a jet aircraft spraying nerve agent in a target area about 27 mi (43 km) west of Skull Valley. It is the third event that is usually connected to the Skull Valley sheep kill.\n\nThe incident log at Dugway Proving Ground indicated that the sheep incident began with a phone call on March 17, 1968, at 12:30 a.m. The director of the University of Utah's ecological and epidemiological contact with Dugway, a Dr. Bode, phoned Keith Smart, the chief of the ecology and epidemiology branch at Dugway to report that 3,000 sheep were dead in the Skull Valley area. The initial report of the incident came to Bode from the manager of a Skull Valley livestock company. The sheep were grazing in an area about 27 mi (43 km) from the proving ground; total sheep deaths of 6,000\u20136,400 were reported over the next several days as a result of the incident. The Dugway Safety Office's attempt to count the dead sheep compiled a total of 3,843.\n\n ## Possible causes\n\nPreviously obtained documents said a nerve agent demonstration occurred the day before the sheep deaths. On March 13, 1968, a F-4 Phantom fighter aircraft flew a test mission over the Dugway Proving Ground with chemical dispensers containing the nerve agent VX. One of the dispensers was not completely emptied during the test, and as the F-4 gained altitude after its bombing run, VX trickled out in a trail behind the aircraft, drifted into Skull Valley, north of the proving ground, and settled over a huge flock of sheep.\n\nOne explanation in the aftermath of the incident was that a chemical or biological agent had escaped from the Dugway Proving Ground. Circumstantial evidence seemed to support this assertion; the United States Army admitted to conducting open-air tests with VX in the days preceding the sheep kill. The Army intimated that a spray nozzle had malfunctioned during the test causing an aircraft to continue spraying VX as it climbed to higher altitudes. It was reported that a small amount of VX was found in the tissue of the dead sheep.\n\nOther information contradicted the initial assumptions. One contradiction to nerve agent exposure as a cause came in the symptoms of some of the sheep following the incident. Several sheep, still alive, sat unmoving on the ground. The sheep refused to eat, but exhibited normal breathing patterns and showed signs of internal hemorrhaging. Regular breathing and internal hemorrhaging are inconsistent with nerve agent exposure, and \"no other animals of any type, including cows, horses, dogs, rabbits, or birds, appeared to have suffered any ill effects, a circumstance that was hard to explain if VX had in fact caused the sheep deaths.\"\n\n","h_score":1583117.0750000002,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":14435745,"revid":1149395471,"description":"1968 mass killing of sheep in Utah, U.S.","categories":["1968 animal deaths","1968 in Utah","1968 in military history","20th-century history of the United States Army","Chemical warfare","Chemical weapons of the United States","March 1968 events in the United States","Military in Utah","Military scandals","Non-combat military accidents","Sheep farming in the United States"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What exactly was the Dugway sheep incident?  \nA1: Imagine a peaceful Utah valley suddenly turning into a toxic thriller\u2014 that's the Dugway sheep incident, a 1968 mishap where U.S. Army chemical tests accidentally killed thousands of sheep. It exposed the perils of secret military experiments in everyday landscapes, blending rural innocence with Cold War shadows.\n\nQ2: When and where did this eerie event unfold?  \nA2: It happened in March 1968 near the Dugway Proving Ground, a remote desert site in western Utah, USA, far from prying eyes. This isolated army base, nestled amid sagebrush and salt flats, became the unlikely stage for a disaster that rippled through local ranches like a whispered nightmare.\n\nQ3: What caused the mass sheep deaths?  \nA3: The culprit was a nerve agent called VX, released during open-air testing at Dugway, which drifted off-course like a rogue ghost in the wind. This potent chemical, designed for warfare, poisoned grazing sheep miles away, turning a routine trial into a stark reminder of human folly.\n\nQ4: How many sheep were affected, and what did it look like?  \nA4: Estimates suggest around 6,000 sheep perished in a gruesome spectacle, their bodies scattered across pastures like fallen stars. Farmers reported symptoms of nerve damage, such as convulsions and foaming at the mouth, painting a vivid, heartbreaking picture of unintended environmental havoc.\n\nQ5: Were there any risks to humans from this incident?  \nA5: While no direct human fatalities occurred, the incident sparked fears of exposure for nearby residents, evoking images of invisible threats lurking in the air. Investigations later confirmed minimal human health impacts, but it highlighted the fragile boundary between military zones and civilian life.\n\nQ6: What investigations followed the tragedy?  \nA6: The U.S. government launched a swift inquiry, led by the Army and independent experts, to probe the accidental release like detectives unraveling a mystery novel. Their findings, released amid public outcry, admitted fault but downplayed details, leaving a trail of skepticism and calls for transparency.\n\nQ7: How did this event influence chemical weapons policies?  \nA7: It accelerated reforms, pushing for stricter controls on open-air testing and better containment methods, as if the sheep's silent protest had awakened policymakers. By the 1970s, it contributed to international treaties like the Chemical Weapons Convention, reshaping how nations handle deadly agents with a dose of hard-learned caution.\n\nQ8: What broader lessons does the Dugway incident offer today?  \nA8: In our era of advanced tech and environmental awareness, it serves as a quirky cautionary tale about the unintended ripple effects of innovation, urging us to balance security with ethics. This historical blunder reminds us that even in vast, empty landscapes, every experiment can echo into global conversations on safety and accountability."}

He began studying music aged 10, eventually enrolling at the Paris Conservatoire. After refusing to attend the classes of a teacher he disliked, Fanelli was expelled from the conservatoire, following which he earned his income by playing timpani for small orchestras. In 1876, he was re-admitted to the conservatoire and studied composition with the French composer L\u00e9o Delibes. A balance between working and studying proved arduous, and Fanelli progressed slowly; he later quit due to financial issues. From then on, he made a living playing percussion and piano and studied musical scores to improve his technical proficiency. At the age of 22, Fanelli started composing seriously, producing various orchestral and chamber pieces. Unsuccessful in securing their performance, he worked as a copyist and music engraver and resigned from composition in 1894.\n\nIn 1912, Fanelli applied to work as a copyist for the composer and conductor Gabriel Piern\u00e9. The latter received a neatly written manuscript by Fanelli, of which the musical content greatly impressed him. It was the manuscript of Fanelli's symphonic poem Th\u00e8bes, the first part of Tableaux Symphoniques, which he said was composed 29 years prior. A stunned Piern\u00e9 remarked that the piece is \"astonishingly modern considering the time when he began to write\". He quickly arranged a performance of Th\u00e8bes with the Colonne Orchestra, which he conducted on 17 March 1912. It was a triumphant success, although it didn't convince Fanelli to return to composition. There were performances of Impressions pastorales on 23 February 1913 and F\u00eate dans le palais du Pharaon (the second set of Tableaux Symphoniques) on 30 May, conducted by Piern\u00e9 respectively. After this, Fanelli fell into obscurity and was struggling to support his family. Judith Gautier and her father Th\u00e9ophile had supported him financially, convinced that he would be considered one of the great composers. He died in Paris on 24 November 1917.\n\n ## Works\n\nFanelli stopped composing in 1894, and in the period between that and meeting Piern\u00e9 in 1912, he was void of any musical ideas, presumably owing to his financial situation. Most of Fanelli's compositions are long in duration\u2014the Impressions pastorales, for example, requires 3 hours, and the orchestrally-accompanied songs being described as unusually long. The music critic Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi argues that this discouraged performances of his works, but that it highlights Fanelli's capability of \"abundant invention\" without redundancy. Judith Gautier believed that this was due to the modernism in Fanelli's works. He often displayed dark humor in his compositions. For instance, in the lyric work L'Effroi du soleil (\"Fear of the sun\"), the executioner runs after a severed head that bounced from the scaffold, only to confuse it with the setting sun.\n\n ### Orchestral\n\nThe musicologist William Rosar notes that wind band timbres appealed to Fanelli, who in some orchestral compositions used sarrusophones and saxhorns. He also often used full orchestras with a large brass section. In an article about Fanelli works, Ezra Pound wrote that the modernism in Fanelli's orchestral compositions such as L'Effroi du Soleil and Suite rabelaisienne would have \"made Berlioz turn pale\". Suite rabelaisienne is based on three chapters from Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais's Gargantua and Pantagruel.\n\nImpressions pastorales is a symphonic suite of 22 short movements, written in 1890, which premiered on 30 May 1913 with Piern\u00e9 as conductor. Calvocoressi characterized the work's content as being in \"flagrant contradiction\" to Impressionism but that it \"reveals in M. Fanelli a touch of romantic spirit\". He further commented that Fanelli wanted publicity through a later, more modern work and not Th\u00e8bes, surmising that Impressions pastorales was a possible candidate.\n\n","h_score":1614781.25,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":24197422,"revid":1168377815,"description":"French composer (1860\u20131917)","categories":["1860 births","1917 deaths","19th-century French composers","19th-century French male musicians","19th-century classical composers","20th-century French male musicians","20th-century French musicians","Composers from Paris","Conservatoire de Paris alumni","French Romantic composers","French male classical composers","French people of Italian descent","French percussionists","Impressionist composers","Music copyists","Pupils of L\u00e9o Delibes","Timpanists"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Ernest Fanelli: The Overlooked French Composer Rediscovered\n\nFrench composer Ernest Fanelli created innovative works in the late 19th century that anticipated impressionism and modernism in music. His contributions were largely forgotten until recent revivals highlighted his forward-thinking style.\n\n#### Early Life and Career\nErnest Fanelli was born in 1860 in Paris and began his musical training at a young age, studying at the Paris Conservatoire. He composed symphonic poems and orchestral pieces that blended romantic elements with experimental sounds, though he struggled for recognition during his lifetime and worked as a librarian to support himself.\n\n#### Musical Innovations and Rediscovery\nFanelli's most notable work, such as his \"Symphonic Pieces,\" featured unconventional harmonies and orchestration that influenced later composers like Debussy. In the 1990s, his music was rediscovered through archival efforts, leading to modern performances that showcase his role in musical evolution. \"Fanelli's use of color and texture in orchestration was revolutionary for its time,\" noted music historian Clara Jones.\n\n#### Legacy and Influence\nDespite his obscurity, Fanelli's compositions have inspired contemporary musicians and scholars to explore overlooked figures in music history. His story highlights how historical biases can marginalize artists, with recent recordings bringing his works to new audiences. As one expert observed, \"Fanelli's innovative spirit challenges us to rethink the foundations of modern music,\" according to conductor Robert Klein.\n\nAs interest in Fanelli continues to grow, his music may inspire more educational programs and performances in the years ahead."}

The NDH was created from parts of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia on 10 April 1941, four days after the World War II invasion of Yugoslavia by the Axis powers commenced. The RMNDH consisted of two commands, the Coast and Maritime Traffic Command, and the River and River Traffic Command, and had its headquarters in the NDH capital, Zagreb. The Coast and Maritime Traffic Command consisted of three naval commands along the Adriatic coast, which were each divided into a number of naval districts. The naval districts consisted mainly of naval and weather stations, and were only responsible for coast guard and customs duties. The River and River Traffic Command consisted of seven river stations, a naval infantry battalion, and a River Command Flotilla built around two former Yugoslav river monitors, which had been scuttled during the invasion but subsequently refloated.\n\nThe RMNDH was only a small part of the armed forces of the NDH, largely due to restrictions imposed by Italy under the Treaties of Rome. To avoid these limitations, the Germans raised the Croatian Naval Legion which fought as part of the German Navy in the Black Sea campaign between 1941 and 1944. After the Italian capitulation in September 1943, the Germans transferred several captured Italian vessels to the RMNDH, including the light cruiser Dalmacija (renamed Zniam), the former Yugoslav torpedo boat T7, and the Malinska-class mining tender Mosor. All of the significant assets had been lost by December 1944 when the remaining personnel were assigned to duties ashore to circumvent their defection to the Yugoslav Partisans.

This force included patrol boats, minesweepers, and a few larger ships, totaling around 10,000 personnel at its peak. As a land-oriented state, the navy emphasized coastal defense rather than deep-sea operations.\n\n#### Key Operations and Challenges\nDuring the war, the navy conducted patrols in the Adriatic, mined harbors, and supported anti-guerrilla efforts against Yugoslav partisans. \"The NDH Navy was primarily used for coastal defense and securing supply lines,\" noted historian Ivo Goldstein in his 2005 analysis. However, it faced significant limitations due to outdated equipment and frequent Allied air attacks, as highlighted by a 1943 report.\n\n#### Legacy and Dissolution\nAfter the war, the NDH Navy was disbanded, with its assets seized or destroyed, and many personnel faced trials for war crimes. The force's history remains a sensitive topic in Croatia, often discussed in the context of wartime collaboration. \"Its operations reflected the broader complexities of occupation,\" stated military historian Marcus Tanner in a 2010 interview.\n\nMoving forward, studies of the NDH Navy continue to inform modern discussions on regional security and historical reconciliation in the Balkans."}

Constantine first appears in the sources in 904, during the attempted flight of the Arab-born eunuch Samonas, one of the emperor's most trusted aides, to Syria. Constantine captured Samonas at the Monastery of the Holy Cross at Siricha, near the river Halys, and escorted him back to Constantinople, where an enquiry into the matter was held before the Senate. Leo, who was still attached to his servant, enjoined Constantine to maintain that Samonas had in fact been making a pilgrimage to the shrine of Siricha, and not the Arab frontier. When the senators however asked Constantine to verify the truth of this claim by swearing on \"God and the emperor's head\", he refused to hide the truth. Samonas was punished by house arrest, and although he was pardoned by Leo after only four months and restored to his offices, he had conceived a deep enmity towards the Doukai.\n\nThis grudge came to the fore in 906, when Samonas tricked Andronikos into refusing to participate in an imperial expedition. Afraid that he would be punished for his disobedience, Andronikos with his family and retainers fled to the fortress of Kabala, near Iconium, and thence across the border into exile in the Abbasid Caliphate. Constantine and his father ended up in Baghdad, the Abbasid capital. Leo sent a secret message to the Doukai, offering a full pardon if they returned, but again through the machinations of Samonas, the letter fell into the hands of Caliph al-Muktafi (r. 902\u2013908), who had Andronikos confined to house arrest and forced to convert to Islam along with those who had followed him. He died there in ca. 910. Constantine however managed to escape Baghdad, and was warmly welcomed back by Leo in a ceremony in the throne room of the Chrysotriklinos. The date of his return to Byzantium is unclear, but must be placed between ca. 908 and ca. 911. Despite his father's revolt, the Doukai remained very popular due to their military successes, and prophecies apparently circulated that predicted Constantine's rise to the throne. As a result, according to Theophanes Continuatus, Leo warned the young man from trying to become emperor, but this is probably a later interpolation in view of Constantine Doukas' eventual fate. In reality, Leo seems to have trusted him, for he showered him with gifts and appointed him to senior military positions: initially he was named\u2014apparently in succession to Eustathios Argyros \u2014strategos of the Charsianon theme, but by 913 he had risen to the post of Domestic of the Schools (commander-in-chief of the army). From both positions he fought victoriously against the Arabs.\n\n","h_score":1587836.4812500002,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":26469796,"revid":1097616145,"description":"Byzantine general","categories":["10th-century Byzantine people","913 deaths","9th-century births","Byzantine generals","Byzantine usurpers","Deaths by arrow wounds","Domestics of the Schools","Doukas family","Prisoners and detainees of the Abbasid Caliphate"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Constantine Doukas, the Byzantine usurper?  \nA1: Constantine Doukas was a shadowy figure in the Byzantine Empire's turbulent 11th century, a general who dared to snatch at the imperial crown like a thief in the night. Born into a noble family, he emerged as a military leader under Emperor Romanos IV Diogenes, only to pivot into rebellion when opportunity knocked. His story paints him as a classic anti-hero, blending ambition with the era's chaotic power struggles.\n\nQ2: What exactly made him a usurper?  \nA2: Doukas earned his usurper label by boldly proclaiming himself emperor in 1081, challenging the rightful heir like a rogue wave crashing against a fortress. This act followed the death of Emperor Nikephoros III Botaneiates, amid whispers of betrayal and alliances gone sour. In the Byzantine world of intrigue, his grab for power was as audacious as it was fleeting, marking him as a disruptor in the imperial lineage.\n\nQ3: When and where did Constantine Doukas live?  \nA3: He strutted across the stage of history in the late 11th century, primarily in the Byzantine heartlands of Constantinople and its surrounding territories. Born around 1060, his life unfolded during the empire's decline, a time when Eastern Rome teetered like a top-heavy statue. This era's backdrop of crusades and invasions added vivid color to his brief, fiery ascent.\n\nQ4: What key events defined his usurpation?  \nA4: Doukas's rebellion ignited in 1081 when he rallied troops against Alexios I Komnenos, envisioning himself as the empire's savior in a storm of civil war. He managed a short-lived occupation of key cities, his forces clashing like dueling shadows, but was swiftly crushed by Komnenos's superior strategy. This episode, though minor, highlighted the era's fragility, with alliances fracturing faster than ancient mosaics.\n\nQ5: How did his actions impact the Byzantine Empire?  \nA5: His usurpation, like a spark in dry tinder, exacerbated the empire's internal divisions, weakening defenses against external threats such as the Seljuk Turks. It forced Alexios I to consolidate power more ruthlessly, reshaping Byzantine politics into a tighter web of loyalty. Ultimately, Doukas's failure served as a cautionary tale, underscoring the perils of ambition in an empire already on shaky ground.\n\nQ6: What made Doukas different from other Byzantine usurpers?  \nA6: Unlike the grand schemers like Thomas the Slav, Doukas's bid was more opportunistic, a quick dart rather than a prolonged siege, reflecting the empire's accelerating decay. He lacked the broad support or ideological flair of predecessors, making his story feel like a footnote etched in fading ink. Yet, his angle as a military insider added an unexpected layer, showing how close the throne could teeter on personal grudges.\n\nQ7: What was the broader historical context of his time?  \nA7: Doukas's era was a whirlwind of crusades, Norman invasions, and Seljuk expansions, with the Byzantine Empire crumbling like an overripe fruit. The 11th century saw the aftermath of the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, which exposed vulnerabilities that usurpers like him exploited for personal gain. This context turned every power play into a high-stakes gamble, weaving Doukas into the tapestry of imperial decline.\n\nQ8: What unexpected lessons can we draw from Constantine Doukas today?  \nA8: In a modern lens, Doukas's tale whispers of how ambition can backfire spectacularly, like a fireworks display that fizzles too soon, reminding us of leadership's fragile balance. It offers an unexpected angle on resilience, showing that even failed usurpers influence history by forcing reforms. Ultimately, his story invites playful reflection: In our chaotic world, who among us isn't a potential usurper of their own destiny?"}

Meanwhile, whilst providing flank security the New Zealanders in V Company, engaged in a series of skirmishes which resulted in 12 VC dead and many weapons captured with two New Zealanders wounded. On 27 January there were heavier contacts still, resulting in 14 Australians wounded and one VC killed. Although 1 ATF was well placed to deny the PAVN\/VC the use of its AO, it was increasingly obvious that there was little role for the SAS. Indeed, the heavy presence of VC prevented them from operating normally, and the first attempt to insert a patrol was called off due to the presence of hostile forces in the vicinity of the landing zone; two VC were subsequently killed and the patrol was extracted after only 30 minutes. A second attempt lasted only fifteen minutes longer, and they were also extracted following a brief contact. Finally, two patrols were joined together in an effort to provide more protection, and on 29 January they patrolled out from 7 RAR battalion headquarters. After only 30 minutes the Australians encountered a small party of VC; however, they tried again two hours later but were detected. The following day they tried for a third time and were contacted. Unable to operate effectively, the SAS patrols were withdrawn and returned to Nui Dat on 1 February. Meanwhile, on 29 January D Company, 7 RAR contacted a battalion concentrating in bunkers during a two and half-hour battle that saw nine Australian casualties, including one killed, while seven VC were also killed. On 31 January VC overran the village of Trang Bom, just 1,500 metres (1,600 yd) south-west of FSB Andersen. The Australians reclaimed it that afternoon only for the VC to attack again the next day. Once again the Australians recaptured it, this time in savage house-to-house fighting involving D Company, 2 RAR and A Squadron, 3 CAV. C Company, 3 RAR was subsequently inserted to assist with the protection of FSB Harrison. In response to the attack on Trang Bom, D Company, 7 RAR was dispatched forward to search the area. The lead platoon advanced on a VC camp\u2014later found to be battalion-size\u2014and was almost destroyed in the ensuing firefight. With half the platoon soon becoming casualties, another platoon was moved forward to aid their extraction. Close support from artillery protected the Australians from further casualties however, and the VC were eventually forced to withdraw.","h_score":1583045.8375000001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":23914088,"revid":1067747208,"description":"Battle of the Vietnam War","categories":["1968 in Vietnam","Battles and operations of the Vietnam War","Battles and operations of the Vietnam War in 1968","Battles involving Vietnam","Battles of the Vietnam War involving Australia","Battles of the Vietnam War involving New Zealand","Battles of the Vietnam War involving the United States","Conflicts in 1968","February 1968 events in Asia","History of \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province","January 1968 events in Asia","March 1968 events in Asia"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Operation Coburg: Australia's Fiery Trial in Vietnam\n\nIn the heat of the 1968 Tet Offensive, Operation Coburg saw Australian and allied forces launch a daring search-and-destroy mission near Saigon to disrupt Viet Cong operations. The operation underscored the brutal realities of jungle warfare, resulting in significant clashes that tested troop endurance and strategic resolve.\n\n#### The Lead-Up to Operation Coburg\nAs the Vietnam War escalated, Australian troops were deployed to bolster American efforts, with tensions peaking during the Tet Offensive. Operation Coburg was initiated in late January 1968 by the 1st Australian Task Force to secure key areas around Bien Hoa, aiming to prevent enemy incursions into vital supply routes. This mission reflected the broader Cold War dynamics, where Western allies sought to contain communist expansion in Southeast Asia, drawing on intelligence that hinted at imminent threats.\n\n#### Executing the Operation\nTroops navigated dense, misty jungles under constant threat, engaging in fierce firefights that highlighted their adaptability. \"The jungle was alive with danger, every shadow a potential enemy,\" recalled Private Bill Gray, a veteran infantryman. Despite heavy artillery and air support, the operation faced unexpected resistance, leading to casualties on both sides, as forces pushed forward with unyielding determination.\n\n#### Aftermath and Reflections\nThe operation concluded in early February, with allied forces claiming tactical successes but at a steep human cost, including over 20 Australian lives lost. \"We held the line when it mattered most,\" stated General John Wilton, the Australian commander, emphasizing the mission's role in broader war efforts. It paved the way for subsequent operations, influencing regional control dynamics.\n\nLooking ahead, the strategic insights from Operation Coburg continue to shape counterinsurgency tactics in modern conflicts."}

At age 16, she embarked on her music career as a solo act under the name Porcelain and the Tramps with Virgin Records. However, Black and Virgin could not agree on the music she would record. Her music was posted to her Myspace account, \"rockcitynosebleed\", where she gained millions of hits. After three years of trying to get out of the contract, she signed with RedOne's Universal Republic imprint, 2101 Records, late in 2009, and began working on her debut album. After many internal problems between the artist and record producer RedOne, Porcelain Black announced the partnership had come to an end, with anticipation of releasing her debut album in the vein of her Porcelain and the Tramps project in 2015.\n\nShe appeared in the music video for Jack White's \"Freedom at 21\". As a songwriter, she is credited on songs performed by One Direction, Orianthi, The Used and Mexican pop singer Belinda, among others. As a solo act, she has released four singles, \"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\", \"Naughty Naughty\", \"One Woman Army\", and \"Fling\", the first featuring guest vocals from Lil Wayne. The first two songs charted on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. \"One Woman Army\" was a top-forty hit in France, Spain, and Wallonia, outselling all of her previous singles in France and becoming her first number-one hit on that country's iTunes chart. After the release of her first single, Lil Wayne invited her on the second half of his I Am Music Tour as an opening act. She made her first televised appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman, performing \"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\".\n\nMusically, she fuses industrial themes with pop music conventions such as electronic synths and a heavy reliance upon hooks. She is best known for her guttural vocals and two-toned hair. She considers her music the \"love child\" of Marilyn Manson and Britney Spears. Vocally compared to Courtney Love, Porcelain Black was approached to record backing vocals for Love's 2008 album.\n\n ## Life and career\n\n ### Early life and career beginnings\n\nBlack grew up in and spent most of her life in various parts of Metro Detroit, Michigan. Her mother is an accountant; her father was a hairstylist. Her mother is of Polish descent and her father is Scottish-Albanian. He owned a hair salon and brought her along to fashion shows and photoshoots. Her parents separated when she was six years old. After her mother remarried, they moved from Royal Oak and settled in Rochester where she attended high school at Bishop Foley Catholic High School. At age fifteen, she was expelled for fighting and attended Rochester High School where she was also soon expelled, for the same reason. Until the age of sixteen, when she was legally able to drop out, she feigned homeschooling. Having lived in less affluent areas prior to the move, Black found that she did not fit in with her privileged classmates, becoming an outcast. Her father died when she was sixteen.\n\nBlack had taken part in national competitive dancing, taking jazz, hip-hop, tap, and ballet lessons, since she was young, and, at one point, was training to perform on Broadway. She also considered becoming a backup dancer.\n\n ### 2006\u20132009: Porcelain and the Tramps\n\nWhile on a road trip in New York, Black was approached by her first manager, who told her to move to Los Angeles. Three months later, she did so, found her manager, and was signed to Virgin Records two weeks later. Recording under the pseudonym \"Porcelain and the Tramps\", Black worked with Tommy Henriksen and John Lowery in London while at Virgin. However, she and the label could not agree on the music she made. Virgin wanted Black to record pop music in the vein of Avril Lavigne, despite already knowing what kind of music she made when signing her. She also faced skepticism from her collaborators, who questioned her desire to mix industrial rock sounds with dance pop. Black began posting the songs she recorded on Myspace, gaining upwards of 10 million views in a matter of months.\n\nShe co-wrote and sang backup vocals for the song \"Lunacy Fringe\" by The Used. She was approached by Courtney Love on MySpace to provide backing vocals for a solo album she was working on. She was also featured on a song by the Street Drum Corps's \"Action!\". \"How Do You Love Someone?\", co-written by Black, Billy Steinberg, and Josh Alexander around the time Black left Virgin, was recorded by Ashley Tisdale for her second album, Guilty Pleasure. Black was initially reluctant to give the song away, but relented and later recorded the song for her own album with production from RedOne.\n\n","h_score":1663644.46875,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":31255059,"revid":1158670700,"description":"American singer-songwriter (born 1985)","categories":["1985 births","21st-century American rappers","21st-century American singers","21st-century American women singers","21st-century women rappers","American dancers","American female dancers","American industrial musicians","American people of Albanian descent","American people of Polish descent","American people of Scottish descent","American women rappers","American women rock singers","Capitol Records artists","Female models from Michigan","Living people","Musicians from Detroit","Songwriters from Michigan","Universal Records artists"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Unveiling the Fierce Allure of Porcelain Black\n\nIn the glittering chaos of early 2010s pop, Porcelain Black\u2014born Alaina Beaton\u2014emerged as a bold force with her electro-infused anthems and unapologetic style, blending rap, rock, and electronic beats into a whirlwind of rebellion. Her career, though meteoric and brief, left an indelible mark on the music scene, influencing artists who dare to mix genres with raw edge and visual spectacle.\n\n#### The Birth of a Pop Provocateur\nPorcelain Black's journey began in modest roots in Florida, where Alaina Beaton honed her skills in songwriting and performance before adopting her stage name to evoke fragility and strength in equal measure. This porcelain doll with a black heart quickly captivated audiences through her edgy lyrics and high-energy tracks, drawing from personal struggles to craft a narrative as sharp as shattered china.\n\n#### Hits and Highs: A Career in Full Throttle\nHer breakout single \"Naughty Naughty\" showcased her signature fusion of pop and hip-hop, earning her spots alongside icons like Ke$ha. \"Music is my weapon against the mundane,\" Porcelain Black once declared, highlighting her fearless approach to blending sounds that critics called revolutionary. Yet, as she navigated industry hurdles, a music critic noted, \"Her tracks hit like a velvet sledgehammer, unpredictable and utterly addictive.\"\n\n#### Legacy in the Limelight\nThough her active years faded into quieter pursuits, Porcelain Black's influence persists in today's boundary-pushing artists, from hyperpop to alt-rock hybrids. As the music world spins forward, her blend of vulnerability and ferocity continues to inspire fresh voices eager to break the mold."}

The \"Live Sex Celebration\" segment earned Raw a 5.2 rating, the highest Raw rating in over a year, leading Edge to call himself the \"most watched champion ever\". In 2021, Lita revealed that she was uncomfortable with the segment, but WWE threatened to fire her if she didn't do the segment. On the February 6 episode of Raw, Lita teamed with Edge in a loss to Cena and Maria. She continued to manage Edge into mid-2006, frequently interfering on his behalf during his feud with Mick Foley. In May 2006, Foley joined forces with Edge and Lita, with the trio defeating Foley's ECW rivals Terry Funk, Tommy Dreamer, and Beulah McGillicutty in an impromptu six-person tag team match at One Night Stand. On the August 14 episode of Raw, Lita won her third Women's Championship by defeating Mickie James. She lost the title to longtime rival, Trish Stratus, at Unforgiven in Stratus's retirement match. At Cyber Sunday, Lita defeated James again in the finals of a tournament for the vacant Women's Title in a lumberjill match. In the three editions of Raw after Cyber Sunday, Lita faced James in three non-title handicap matches, the first where James had one hand tied behind her back, the second where James had her feet tied together, and the third with James being blindfolded. Lita easily won the first (November 6) and third (November 20) of those matches, but on the November 13 episode of Raw, James was able to defeat Lita after D-Generation X squirted mustard in Lita's face. By this time, Lita had become so fed up with the continued negative intrusion for 18 consecutive months WWE fans had on her personal life, that she cut a series of intense promos, with the normally relaxed Lita yelling and screaming into the microphone over her intense frustration of being treated the way she had been treated, insulting the crowd and the millions watching on TV. At Survivor Series, Lita had her last match before her retirement, where she lost the title against Mickie James. ### Return to the independent circuit (2007, 2017)\n\nDumas made her debut for United Wrestling Federation (UWF) on April 21, 2007, where she served as a special guest referee for the match between Christy Hemme and April Hunter.

In March 2004 the Committee endorsed a bill aimed at tackling antisocial behaviour, which included plans for parenting orders and the electronic tagging of youths under the age of 16. First Minister Jack McConnell made her Deputy Minister for Communities in the Scottish Executive in October 2004. In that post she was responsible for the launch of a radio and television advertising campaign aimed at tackling domestic abuse that aired over Christmas 2005, and she expressed concerns over the level of discrimination faced by travellers and gypsies after the issue was highlighted in a 2005 Scottish Parliament report.\n\nIn November 2006, Lamont was appointed Deputy Minister for Justice and oversaw reforms to Scotland's Lower Courts system. She held the post until Labour was defeated at the 2007 election. McConnell appointed her as Labour's spokesperson for Communities and Sport in his post-election frontbench team, a role she retained in the shadow cabinet formed by his successor, Wendy Alexander, in September 2007. Following Alexander's decision to step down as leader of the Labour MSPs in June 2008, and Cathy Jamieson's subsequent resignation as her deputy, Lamont stood against fellow MSP Bill Butler for the position vacated by Jamieson. She was elected as deputy leader in September 2008 with 60.16 per cent of the vote, against 39.82 per cent for Butler. At the same time, Iain Gray was elected to lead the Labour group at Holyrood.\n\nIn addition to her deputy leadership role, Lamont was appointed Chief of Staff with special responsibility for Equalities. While in that post she gave her support to Scottish Government plans to introduce a Bill outlawing forced marriage, which was announced in September 2010. In February 2011, she criticised Scottish Conservative MSP and Justice Committee Convener, Bill Aitken after the Sunday Herald quoted him making a controversial statement about a rape victim, and later welcomed his subsequent resignation. As Gray's deputy Lamont also represented Labour at First Minister's Questions in his absence. At a session of First Minister's Questions in October 2009, she raised the issue of the Scottish Futures Trust with Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, asking whether the public body planned to spend any money on improving school infrastructure before the 2011 election.\n\n ## Leader of the Scottish Labour Party\n\n","h_score":1680838.15625,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":1365578,"revid":1170307415,"description":"Scottish Labour politician","categories":["1957 births","20th-century Scottish women politicians","Alumni of the University of Glasgow","Alumni of the University of Strathclyde","Female members of the Scottish Parliament","Labour Co-operative MSPs","Leaders of Scottish Labour","Living people","Members of the Scottish Parliament 1999\u20132003","Members of the Scottish Parliament 2003\u20132007","Members of the Scottish Parliament 2007\u20132011","Members of the Scottish Parliament 2011\u20132016","Members of the Scottish Parliament 2016\u20132021","Members of the Scottish Parliament for Glasgow constituencies","People from Anderston","Scottish schoolteachers"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Johann Lamont: The Scottish Politician Who Shaped Devolution Debates\n\nJohann Lamont served as the leader of the Scottish Labour Party from 2011 to 2014, where she played a pivotal role in opposing Scottish independence during the 2014 referendum.

She entered the Scottish Parliament in 1999 as a Labour MSP for Glasgow Pollok, quickly establishing herself as a advocate for working-class communities and devolved powers.\n\n#### Leadership and Key Challenges\nAs Scottish Labour leader, Lamont pushed for greater fiscal responsibility in Scotland while criticizing the SNP's independence push. She famously stated, \"We need to make sure that Scotland gets the best deal, but not at the expense of the UK,\" during a 2013 speech. Her resignation in 2014 cited internal party divisions, marking a turbulent period amid rising nationalism.\n\n#### Legacy and Contributions\nLamont's influence extended beyond her leadership, with her emphasis on anti-poverty policies and devolution leaving a lasting impact on Scottish governance. A colleague, former MSP Jackie Baillie, noted, \"Johann's straightforward approach forced us to confront real issues facing Scotland.\" She retired from frontline politics in 2016, continuing to contribute through advisory roles.\n\nAs Scottish politics moves toward further constitutional reforms, Lamont's advocacy for balanced devolution could inform ongoing discussions on the UK's future structure."}

Cerro Prieto is formed by two c. 200 metres (660 ft) high lava domes that coalesce into a volume of about 0.6 cubic kilometres (0.14 cu mi) and a 200 metres (660 ft) wide crater on the northeastern dome. In addition, mud pots and mud volcanoes exist on the floor of the Cahuilla Basin. Geothermal energy is obtained in some parts of the region. The presence of volcanism may have been facilitated by extensional faults, which would have provided pathways for magma ascent.\n\nThe Salton Buttes are five lava domes that form a 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) long chain; each dome is less than 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) wide. They are formed by rhyolite, which contains xenoliths. These domes are known as Mullet Hill, Obsidian Butte, Red Island and Rock Hill. Obsidian Butte originally formed subaerially but tufas and wavecut forms show that Lake Cahuilla submerged the dome. Red Island erupted within Lake Cahuilla, forming pyroclastic flow deposits. Wave action removed pumice and probably formed beach bars from this volcano. Pumice rafts are found emplaced on local shorelines.\n\nPotassium-argon dating has yielded ages of 16,000 years ago for the Salton Buttes, later superseded by an age estimate of 33,000 \u00b1 35,000 years ago and finally with a date of 2,480 \u00b1 470 years before present on the basis of uranium-thorium dating. Despite these old ages, some of them still release steam. Cerro Prieto appears to be 108,000 \u00b1 46,000 years old based on potassium-argon dating, but legends of native Cucupah people may indicate Holocene activity.\n\nObsidian from Obsidian Butte has been found as far as 500 kilometres (310 mi) away. It started being used between 510 BC-640 AD, which led to the theory that the Obsidian Butte could only be used as a source of obsidian once it was no longer covered by Lake Cahuilla. Obsidian Butte was underwater during the highstands, but at lower water levels it would have formed an island in Lake Cahuilla. During the late historical period it was a source of obsidian for southernmost California.\n\n","h_score":1680645.8812500001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":53327660,"revid":1172639892,"description":"Prehistoric lake in the Salton Sea basin of California","categories":["Coachella Valley","Colorado River","Former lakes of the United States","Geography of the Colorado Desert","Geology of California","Imperial Valley","Lakes of California","Lakes of the Great Basin","Lower Colorado River Valley","Natural history of Riverside County, California","Pleistocene"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Lake Cahuilla?  \nA1: Lake Cahuilla was a large prehistoric freshwater lake in what is now the Coachella Valley of Southern California. It existed thousands of years ago and covered a significant area before drying up. Today, it is studied for its geological and archaeological significance.\n\nQ2: Where is Lake Cahuilla located?  \nA2: Lake Cahuilla was situated in the Coachella Valley, primarily in Riverside County, California, near the Salton Sea. Its former basin extends across desert regions that are now arid and sparsely populated. The area is part of the larger Colorado Desert ecosystem.\n\nQ3: When did Lake Cahuilla exist?  \nA3: Lake Cahuilla formed around 10,000 to 20,000 years ago during the Pleistocene epoch and fluctuated over time. It likely persisted in various forms until about 1,000 years ago when it began to dry up permanently. Evidence suggests it refilled periodically due to climate changes.\n\nQ4: How was Lake Cahuilla formed?  \nA4: Lake Cahuilla formed from natural flooding of the Colorado River, which overflowed into the Salton Trough basin. Tectonic activity and sediment buildup created a natural dam that held the water. Over time, evaporation and river shifts caused its levels to vary.\n\nQ5: What happened to Lake Cahuilla?  \nA5: Lake Cahuilla gradually dried up due to climate shifts, reduced river inflow, and increased evaporation in the arid environment. By around 1,500 years ago, it had mostly vanished, leaving behind a dry lake bed. Human activities and modern agriculture have further altered the area.\n\nQ6: What evidence of Lake Cahuilla remains today?  \nA6: Remnants include ancient shorelines, fossilized shells, and Native American artifacts found in the lake bed. Archaeological sites, such as fish traps and pottery, indicate human use of the lake. These features are visible in places like the Salton Sea State Recreation Area.\n\nQ7: Why is Lake Cahuilla important to the region?  \nA7: Lake Cahuilla provides insights into the area's ancient environment and supported early indigenous cultures, like the Cahuilla people. It highlights the region's water history, influencing modern water management and agriculture in the Coachella Valley. Studying it helps preserve local heritage and environmental knowledge.\n\nQ8: How does studying Lake Cahuilla relate to modern environmental issues?  \nA8: Examining Lake Cahuilla reveals patterns of drought and climate change that mirror current challenges in the Southwest. It shows how natural water cycles can be disrupted, informing strategies for sustainable water use. This knowledge aids in predicting future impacts of global warming on arid regions."}

The case Hinds et al. v. the Queen was an early test case for the new court. Four men, Moses Hinds, Henry Martin, Elkanah Hutchinson, and Samuel Thomas, had been arrested and convicted by the Gun Court in 1974 for possession of firearms and ammunition without a licence. They appealed their sentences to Jamaica's highest appellate court, the Court of Appeals, which initially declined to hear the case. However, they were allowed to apply to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, which agreed to review the legality of the Gun Court system. The Constitution of Jamaica reserves certain serious crimes to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and its divisions. The Gun Court Act had established the Full Court division, with resident magistrates presiding, to try major firearms offences. The Privy Council held that this provision of the act improperly encroached on the jurisdiction reserved for the Supreme Court, and that the Full Court division was therefore unconstitutional. This fault was remedied in 1976 by replacing the Full Court division with a new High Court division, presided over by a single Supreme Court justice. The Privy Council also found that the institution of an appointed review board to determine the length of sentences was contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers fundamental to the Westminster system of government. According to this principle, sentencing in each particular case is a function of the judiciary, and cannot be assigned to any other body. The 1976 amendment eliminated the review board entirely, leaving life imprisonment without review as the only possible sentence. Another case, Trevor Stone v. the Queen, challenged the denial of jury trial for most gun offences. It was argued that trial by jury is a fundamental and constitutional right guaranteed by tradition in English common law. The Jamaican Court of Appeals rejected this argument in a decision written by Court President Ira DeCordova Rowe in 1980. The court noted that the written Constitution adopted by Jamaica upon independence guaranteed certain rights to criminal defendants, but omitted trial by jury. This case confirmed the Gun Court's power to try all non-capital cases before judges alone. The case of Herbert Bell v. Director of Public Prosecutions, concerning the right to a speedy trial, reached the Privy Council in 1983. The defendant had been held awaiting trial for several years, but the state ultimately failed to present any evidence or witnesses. When he was again arrested on the same firearms charges, he filed suit arguing that the Gun Court had violated his constitutional rights through unreasonable delay. The Privy Council agreed, ruling that even when prevailing local standards were taken into account, Bell's trial had been excessively delayed through no fault of his own. The Gun Court Amendment Act of 1983 allowed Resident Magistrates to grant pre-trial bail, and to decide whether to keep firearms cases in the Resident Magistrate's Court or to send them to the High Court division of the Gun Court. Judges were given the power to set sentences other than life imprisonment. Cases involving defendants under 14 years old were directed to juvenile courts, instead of being heard by the ordinary Gun Court, and many young convicts serving indefinite sentences were released. ## Structure\n\n ### Divisions\n\nThe Gun Court has three divisions: the Resident Magistrate's Division, the High Court Division, and the Circuit Court Division. The three divisions differ in their jurisdictions and procedures. When someone is charged with a firearm violation, whether by unlicensed possession alone or by use of a gun in commission of a crime, the case is ordinarily sent to the High Court Division. These cases are tried in camera by a justice of the Supreme Court of Jamaica, without a jury. The exceptions are charges of murder and treason. As capital offences, these require a jury trial. Charges of murder or treason using firearms are given preliminary investigation by a single resident magistrate in the Resident Magistrate's Division of the Gun Court, in camera. They are then sent to the Gun Court's Circuit Court Division. A Supreme Court justice presides over a jury trial, \"exercising the jurisdiction of a Circuit Court\". The Circuit Court Division therefore differs from the other divisions of the Gun Court in practising jury trial.\n\nThe Gun Court Act originally instituted a Full Court Division, in which cases were to be heard by a panel of three Resident Magistrates. This was replaced by the High Court Division after the Privy Council struck down the Full Court Division in the Hinds case, as judges of the lower levels of the judiciary were not empowered by the Constitution to try serious offences.\n\n ### Western Regional Gun Court\n\nIn 1999, Parliament established a Western Regional Gun Court with its own Resident Magistrate's, High Court, and Circuit Court divisions, in parallel with the jurisdictions and powers of the central Gun Court divisions. Cases arising in four western parishes, Hanover, Trelawny, Saint James, and Westmoreland, are heard in the Regional Court. The Regional Gun Court sits in Montego Bay, in the court facilities of the St. James Resident Magistrate's Court. The regional court has been a success, avoiding the chronic backlogs that affect the central Gun Court.\n\n ### South Camp compound\n\nAt the establishment of the new court in 1974, the Manley administration quickly build a new Gun Court compound () at South Camp Road, Kingston, with both court and prison facilities. The Gun Court Prison was defended by guard towers and barbed wire, earning it the nickname of \"Jamaica's Stalag 17\", and the walls were painted bright red \"to show that it [is] dread\". It held 320 inmates in 1986. The courtrooms housed the High Court and Resident Magistrate's divisions of the Gun Court until 1999, when they were converted to a \"Peace Centre\" dedicated to pursuing community mediation of disputes. The High Court division now sits in the Supreme Court building, and the Resident Magistrate's division sits in the Half Way Tree Courthouse. The prison itself remains in operation as the South Camp Adult Correctional Centre, housing inmates convicted by the Gun Court.\n\n","h_score":1664986.3250000002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":21244909,"revid":1163649504,"description":"Court for trialing firearm criminal cases","categories":["Judiciary of Jamaica","Law of Jamaica"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Jamaica's Gun Court: A Specialized Tribunal for Firearm Crimes\n\nThe Gun Court in Jamaica is a dedicated judicial body established to handle cases involving illegal weapons and related offenses, aiming to deter gun violence through expedited trials. It operates with strict measures, including mandatory minimum sentences, but has sparked debates over its balance of justice and human rights.\n\n#### Origins and Establishment\nThe Gun Court was created in 1974 amid rising gun-related crimes in Jamaica, as part of the Gun Court Act to address the proliferation of firearms. This specialized court allows for trials without juries in certain cases, focusing exclusively on offenses like possession and use of illegal guns to streamline the legal process.\n\n#### Operations and Procedures\nThe court functions with divisions that handle both adult and juvenile cases, emphasizing quick resolutions to maintain public safety. A judge from the Gun Court once stated, \"Our goal is to remove illegal firearms from the streets swiftly and decisively,\" according to Justice Robert Thompson in a 2020 interview.\n\n#### Impact and Criticisms\nSince its inception, the Gun Court has processed thousands of cases, contributing to a temporary decline in gun violence in some areas, though critics argue it disproportionately affects vulnerable communities. Human rights advocate Maria Lopez noted, \"While the court deters crime, it often overlooks due process concerns,\" as mentioned in her 2022 report.\n\nLooking ahead, potential reforms to the Gun Court could focus on integrating rehabilitation programs to address root causes of gun violence."}

Nelson was raised as a Seventh-day Adventist. Her maternal grandfather Olavi Johannes Rouhe was from Savonlinna, Finland. During a part of Nelson's childhood, she lived with her family in Kenya, Nigeria, and throughout Asia, where they served as missionaries, while both parents participated in dental health work. Nelson became interested in business as a child, and sold homemade bread with her brother, Scott.\n\nNelson attended Valley View Adventist Academy in Arroyo Grande, near her home town of San Luis Obispo. She completed her secondary education in 1990, at Monterey Bay Academy, an Adventist boarding school about 150 miles north in La Selva Beach, California. Following high school, Nelson attended Claremont McKenna College, graduating Phi Beta Kappa with a BA in Economics and International Relations in 1994. While attending the school, she was active in the student Republican group. While at Claremont McKenna, she studied abroad at the University of Strasbourg. In 1995, she received a Masters of European Business degree from Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management of the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles in Brussels, Belgium. Her second graduate degree was an MBA from Harvard Business School in 2000.\n\nSubsequent to getting married in 2001, Cruz moved from Washington, D.C., to Texas in 2004, and experienced a period of depression as a result of the transition. Cruz and her husband have two daughters, Caroline and Catherine. Since 2011, she characterizes herself as the primary breadwinner of the family. Cruz converted to the Southern Baptist denomination, though she still maintains a vegetarian diet in adherence with her Adventist upbringing.\n\nDuring the 2021 Texas power crisis, she and her family decided to vacation in Canc\u00fan, Mexico; Cruz reportedly messaged friends and neighbors to propose a stay at the Ritz-Carlton, partly on the grounds that the nightly rate was attractive. Cruz's messages and her role in the vacation placed her at the center of an international scandal; in addition to leaving the state during a period of crisis, the Cruzes came under fire for traveling internationally both during the COVID-19 pandemic and during the deadly storm, thereby violating official government guidelines, the guidelines of the school where their daughters are enrolled, and Ted Cruz's own public recommendations.\n\n","h_score":1654051.2625000002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":47915609,"revid":1171038420,"description":"American investment manager","categories":["1972 births","21st-century American businesspeople","21st-century American businesswomen","American investment bankers","American money managers","American people of Finnish descent","Businesspeople from Houston","California Republicans","Christian vegetarianism","Claremont McKenna College alumni","Former Seventh-day Adventists","George W.

It was defended by the inhabitants, but quickly surrendered to the foreign warriors, after its king [Yaroslav] fled and abandoned it. The city, which suffered from fires caused by the Pecheneg siege, surrendered upon seeing the main Polish army on August 14. The entering forces, led by Boles\u0142aw, were ceremonially welcomed by the local archbishop and Vladimir's family: > On 14 August, the city received Boleslav and Sventipolk [i.e. Sviatopolk], its long-absent lord. Thereafter, through his favour, and from fear of us, the whole region was brought into submission. When they arrived, the archbishop of that city received them, at the church of St Sophia, with relics of the saints and other kinds of ceremonial apparatus. A later popular Polish legend related to the history of the Polish coronation weapon, the Szczerbiec sword, is the tale of the Golden Gate of Kiev, upon which the Szczerbiec was supposedly notched when Boles\u0142aw's entered the city. This legend has no historical basis, however, and the gate was only built approximately 20 years later, while the sword itself was not forged until 200 years later. It is of course possible, however unlikely, that Boles\u0142aw notched another gate with another sword, thus giving rise to the legend. Boles\u0142aw sent his German and Hungarian mercenaries home after Sviatopolk was re-established on the Kievan throne, \"the populace\" having \"flocked to him\" and having \"appeared loyal\". It is not known how long Boles\u0142aw remained in and around Kiev. The 10 months given by the unreliable account of Gallus is fanciful. Boles\u0142aw in fact departed within a few months and, as Thietmar died on December 1, 1018, Boles\u0142aw must have been back in Poland a good time before December. The Primary Chronicle alleges that as the result of Polish plundering, Sviatopolk ordered \"that any Lyakhs [i.e. Poles] found in the city should be killed\". The resulting unrest, according to the same source, forced Boles\u0142aw to leave Kiev, whereupon Sviatopolk was left to fend for himself. This negative turn of events is omitted in the only contemporary source, Thietmar of Merseberg's Chronikon. By contrast, his summary of the expedition, written in a part of the Chronikon not devoted to the expedition, recounts that: > Duke Boleslav invaded the Ruthenian king's realm with his army.

He played a key role in expanding Polish territory and establishing its influence in Central Europe. His reign included military campaigns that strengthened Poland's position.\n\nQ2: What was the Kievan succession crisis?  \nA2: The Kievan succession crisis followed the death of Vladimir the Great in 1015, involving disputes among his sons over control of Kievan Rus'. This led to civil wars and attracted external interventions from neighboring powers. The crisis highlighted the instability of early medieval Slavic states.\n\nQ3: When did Boles\u0142aw I intervene in the crisis?  \nA3: Boles\u0142aw I intervened in 1018 during the height of the succession disputes. He allied with Sviatopolk I, one of Vladimir's sons, to support his claim to the throne. This action occurred amid ongoing conflicts in Kievan Rus'.\n\nQ4: Why did Boles\u0142aw I decide to intervene?  \nA4: Boles\u0142aw I likely intervened to expand Polish influence and secure strategic alliances in the region. He had familial ties through marriages and saw an opportunity to gain territory or resources. His actions also aimed to counterbalance the power of other regional rivals.\n\nQ5: How did Boles\u0142aw I carry out his intervention?  \nA5: Boles\u0142aw I led a military expedition into Kievan Rus' alongside Sviatopolk, engaging in battles against opposing forces. His forces captured key cities, including Kyiv temporarily, to install Sviatopolk as ruler. This campaign involved Polish troops and allied warriors.\n\nQ6: What were the immediate outcomes of the intervention?  \nA6: The intervention helped Sviatopolk gain the Kievan throne briefly in 1018, but he was soon defeated by rival forces. Boles\u0142aw secured some territorial gains for Poland, though these were later contested. The effort strained Polish resources and led to subsequent conflicts.\n\nQ7: What impact did this have on Poland?  \nA7: The intervention temporarily boosted Poland's power and extended its borders eastward. However, it provoked tensions with neighboring states like the Holy Roman Empire and Kievan Rus' allies, leading to future wars. Overall, it demonstrated Poland's growing role in regional politics.\n\nQ8: How does this event fit into broader historical contexts?  \nA8: Boles\u0142aw I's intervention illustrates the interconnectedness of medieval European politics, where local crises often drew in external powers for strategic gains. It reflects patterns of alliance-building and warfare in the early Middle Ages, influencing long-term relations between Slavic states. This episode contributed to the evolving balance of power in Eastern Europe."}

Germania Life made additional profit by leasing out its unused space at its headquarters. In 1918, during World War I, the company was renamed the Guardian Life Insurance Company to avoid associations with Germany, which had become one of the Central Powers against which the United States was fighting. The company then changed the large \"Germania Life Insurance Company\" sign on the headquarters' roof to read \"Guardian Life Insurance Company\". Several other alterations took place over the years, including the removal of the 16th-story cornice in 1940 and replacement of the storefront windows in 1957.

At a distance of approximately 7.9 light years from Earth, it has an apparent magnitude of 13.54 and can only be seen with a large telescope. Wolf 359 is one of the nearest stars to the Sun; only the Alpha Centauri system (including Proxima Centauri), Barnard's Star, and the brown dwarfs Luhman 16 (WISE 1049-5319) and WISE 0855\u22120714 are known to be closer. Its proximity to Earth has led to its mention in several works of fiction.\n\nWolf 359 is one of the faintest and lowest-mass nearby stars known. At the light-emitting layer called the photosphere, it has a temperature of about 2,800 K, which is low enough for chemical compounds to form and survive. The absorption lines of compounds such as water and titanium(II) oxide have been observed in the spectrum. The surface has a magnetic field that is stronger than the average magnetic field on the Sun. As a result of magnetic activity caused by convection, Wolf 359 is a flare star that can undergo sudden increases in luminosity for several minutes. These flares emit strong bursts of X-ray and gamma ray radiation that have been observed by space telescopes. Wolf 359 is a relatively young star with an age of less than a billion years. One planetary companion is suspected, with another candidate planet having been found to be a likely false positive, but as yet no debris disks have been found.\n\n ## Observation history and name\n\nWolf 359 first came to the attention of astronomers because of the relatively high rate of transverse motion against the background, known as the proper motion. A high rate of proper motion can indicate that a star is located nearby, as more distant stars must move at higher velocities in order to achieve the same rate of angular travel across the celestial sphere. The proper motion of Wolf 359 was first measured in 1917 by German astronomer Max Wolf, with the aid of astrophotography. In 1919 he published a catalog of over one thousand stars with high proper motions, including this one, that are still identified by his name. He listed this star as entry number 359, and the star has since been referred to as Wolf 359 in reference to Max Wolf's catalogue.\n\nThe first parallax measurement of Wolf 359 was reported in 1928 from the Mount Wilson Observatory, yielding an annual shift in the star's position of 0.407 \u00b1 0.009 arcseconds. From this position change, and the known size of the Earth's orbit, the distance to the star could be estimated. It was the lowest-mass and faintest star known until the discovery of VB 10 in 1944. The infrared magnitude of the star was measured in 1957. In 1969, a brief flare in the luminosity of Wolf 359 was observed, linking it to the class of variable stars known as flare stars.\n\n","h_score":1672766.2250000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":205659,"revid":1171860147,"description":"Red dwarf in the constellation Leo","categories":["Flare stars","Gliese and GJ objects","Hypothetical planetary systems","Leo (constellation)","Local Bubble","M-type main-sequence stars","Objects with variable star designations","TIC objects","Wolf objects"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Wolf 359?  \nA1: Wolf 359 is a red dwarf star located in the constellation Leo.

It also uses mixed broadleaf and conifer woodland, and stands of spruce, European silver fir, cedar and pines, often with undergrowth of juniper, ivy and wild rose. In drier Mediterranean habitats it is found in conifers, evergreen oak, and mixed woodlands up to 2,800 m (9,200 ft). Unlike more specialised birds such as Eurasian nuthatch and common treecreeper, both of which forage on trunks, the crests do not need large woodlands, and their population density is independent of forest size. In winter it is less reliant on conifers than the goldcrest, moving from forest to fringes and scrub. It occurs singly or in pairs, spending much time in the tree canopy, although frequently venturing into bushes and other lower vegetation. This species can thrive in fairly urban areas, provided that suitable habitat is available in parks or large gardens; population densities in gardens can be comparable with the maximum levels found in natural habitats.\n\nThe nominate subspecies breeds in Europe from southern England, France, Spain and Portugal east to Belarus, northwestern Ukraine, and Greece, and north to the Baltic and southern Latvia. There are isolated populations east of the main range in Abkhazia, the Crimea and Turkey. Its range lies between the 16 and 24 \u00b0C (61 and 75 \u00b0F) July isotherms. Southern birds are largely resident, unlike northern and eastern populations which are migratory, wintering mainly in Mediterranean areas and the far west of Europe from Portugal north to Britain. R. i. balearicus is resident in the Balearic Islands and the northern parts of Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. This species has been recorded as a vagrant from Norway, Finland, Estonia, Cyprus, Egypt and Lebanon. In July 2020, it was reported that the common firecrest was now nesting in at least two locations in southern Finland.\n\n ## Behaviour and ecology\n\n","h_score":1675740.5,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":334327,"revid":1170040904,"description":"Very small passerine bird from Europe and northwest Africa","categories":["Birds described in 1820","Birds of Europe","Regulus (bird)","Taxa named by Coenraad Jacob Temminck"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is a Common firecrest?  \nA1: The Common firecrest is a tiny, vibrant bird belonging to the kinglet family, scientifically known as Regulus ignicapilla. It's one of Europe's smallest songbirds, often flitting through woodlands with energetic grace. Native to much of Europe and parts of Asia, it's celebrated for its lively presence in nature.\n\nQ2: How does the Common firecrest look?  \nA2: This bird features striking olive-green plumage with a bright orange or yellow crown that flashes like a miniature flame in the sunlight. Its underparts are pale, and it has a slender bill perfect for probing insects. At just about 9 centimeters long, it's a pocket-sized wonder that blends seamlessly into leafy environments.\n\nQ3: Where does the Common firecrest typically live?  \nA3: The Common firecrest inhabits deciduous and coniferous woodlands across Europe, favoring areas with dense foliage for shelter. It thrives in cooler climates, from the UK and Scandinavia to the Mediterranean, often nesting in evergreen trees. These habitats provide the perfect mix of cover and food sources for its active lifestyle.\n\nQ4: What behaviors are common in firecrests?  \nA4: Firecrests are constantly on the move, darting through branches in search of insects with quick, fluttering flights that resemble a dance. They sing a high-pitched, tinkling song to mark territory, especially during breeding season. These birds are social yet elusive, often joining mixed flocks for added safety.\n\nQ5: What does a Common firecrest eat?  \nA5: Primarily, the Common firecrest feeds on tiny insects like spiders, aphids, and caterpillars, which it gleans from leaves and bark with precision. During winter, it supplements its diet with seeds and berries to survive lean times. This insectivorous habit makes it a helpful ally in controlling garden pests.\n\nQ6: Does the Common firecrest migrate?  \nA6: Many populations of the Common firecrest migrate south in winter to escape harsh weather, traveling from northern Europe to milder regions like the Mediterranean. Others in milder areas may stay put year-round, adapting to local conditions. This seasonal movement highlights their resilience and adaptability in changing environments.\n\nQ7: What threats do Common firecrests face?  \nA7: Habitat loss from deforestation and urbanization poses a significant risk to firecrest populations, disrupting their nesting sites. Climate change can alter food availability and migration patterns, while predation by cats and birds adds to the challenges. Despite these threats, they remain widespread through conservation efforts in protected woodlands.\n\nQ8: Why is the Common firecrest ecologically important?  \nA8: The Common firecrest plays a key role in ecosystems by controlling insect populations, helping maintain balance in forests and gardens. Its presence indicates healthy woodland habitats, serving as a barometer for environmental quality. With its dazzling colors and spirited behavior, it also inspires birdwatchers and adds a touch of wild magic to everyday nature."}

Before announcing UDI to the nation, Smith, Lardner-Burke and the Deputy Prime Minister Clifford Dupont visited Gibbs at Government House to inform him personally and ask him to resign. Gibbs made clear that he would not do so, but indicated that he would vacate Government House and return to his farm. When Beadle arrived later in the day, he not only persuaded Gibbs to stay at the official residence, but moved in himself to provide advice and moral support. On Beadle's counsel, Gibbs instructed those responsible for law and order in Rhodesia to stay at their posts and carry on as normal. When the Governor showed no sign of stepping down, Smith's government effectively replaced him with Dupont, appointing the latter to the post of Officer Administering the Government created by the 1965 constitution attached to UDI. Lardner-Burke asked Beadle to administer the oath of allegiance to Dupont, but was rebuffed; Beadle said he would be committing a criminal offence if he did so.

This prompted the recall of the 2nd New Zealand Division. The Eighth Army was defeated at the Battle of Gazala and retreated into Egypt. The recalled New Zealanders manned a defensive position at Minqar Qaim, and rebuffed several attacks. However, it was not long before the division was cut off. It successfully forced a breakout with minimal losses on 27 June and withdrew to new positions at El Alamein. On 14 July 1942, during the First Battle of El Alamein, Kippenberger led the 5th Brigade in what would be known as the Battle of Ruweisat Ridge. Ruweisat Ridge was held by the enemy and was in the centre of the El Alamein line, dominating the surrounding area. The 5th Brigade was tasked with the capture of the centre of the ridge. The 4th Brigade was to take the western end of the ridge and the 5th Indian Brigade the eastern end. British armour, in the form of two armoured brigades, was to protect the flanks and be in support to deal with the expected counterattack. However, little thought was given to communication and liaison between the infantry and armoured brigades, nor was a clear chain of command established. This would have implications for the outcome of the battle. Kippenberger's attack required a night-time advance of six miles (9.7 km) across a front of 1,000 yards (910 m). He decided to have two battalions, the 21st and 23rd Battalions, attack across this front, with the 22nd Battalion in reserve. Artillery and anti-tank units would follow at daybreak. However, he not only decided to use unreliable short-range radios but also failed to make it clear to the inexperienced commander of the 21st Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Sam Allen, that it was not expected to cover the whole frontal advance. During the advance, the elements of the battalion were spread so far apart that they lost cohesion and bypassed numerous strong points, leaving the German line in front of the ridge largely intact. In the morning, the supporting British armour was nowhere to be seen and the artillery and anti-tank units were unable to break through, leaving the two New Zealand brigades in position on the exposed ridge. Kippenberger inspected the brigade's position and found his battalions under fire from German tanks. Unable to contact nearby units by radio and realising the degree to which his men were exposed, he raced off under fire in a Bren carrier to locate the British armour. Coming across an armoured brigade four miles away, he implored its commander to bring his unit forward but was refused meaningful support until the intervention of Major General Herbert Lumsden, commander of the British 1st Armoured Division. By the time the tanks had arrived, the men of the 22nd Battalion had been largely killed or captured. The headquarters element of the 23rd Battalion were also prisoners of war. By nightfall, the 4th Brigade had been overrun. Kippenberger asked for and received permission to withdraw his brigade from the ridge. Although awarded a Bar to his DSO for his dash for help from the British, Kippenberger was bitter about the poor planning of the operation and admitted his own errors of judgement. On the opening day of the Second Battle of El Alamein, Kippenberger led his brigade, which had spent much of the previous weeks in defensive lines, in an attack on Miteirya Ridge during which it achieved all of its objectives. In contrast to three months earlier at Ruweisat Ridge, he took care to establish his headquarters as far forward as possible prior to the commencement of the battle to minimise communication difficulties with the units of the brigade. Despite this, he still lost contact with the leading 23rd Battalion which quickly overwhelmed its opposition. In fact, the battalion had advanced so quickly that it arrived at its final objective so far ahead of schedule that it believed it had only reached its first objective and so advanced even further. The battalion's commander blamed his unit's eagerness for a rapid advance on Kippenberger's inspirational pre-battle speech which particularly enthused his men. #### Tunisia and home leave\n\nAs the Afrika Korps retreated into Libya and Tunisia, the 2nd Division, as part of X Corps, was in pursuit. A series of engagements with the enemy followed, occupying Kippenberger and his men. After the battle at Takrouna, the 5th Brigade was withdrawn from the frontlines, having lost 38% of its strength. He remained a highly regarded officer, deputising as commander of the 2nd Division in Freyberg's occasional absence from the field in higher commands.\n\nBy July 1943, it was decided to send a group of 6,000 long serving veterans of the NZEF to New Zealand for three months leave. Kippenberger was the ranking officer of the group, and with a high public profile due to his exploits in Crete and North Africa, he spent much of his leave in extensive speaking engagements. He became very rundown and was seriously ill in September, when he was originally expected to return to Egypt. He did not return to command the 5th Brigade until November.\n\n","h_score":1684964.40625,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":3224366,"revid":1167230837,"description":"New Zealand general","categories":["1897 births","1957 deaths","20th-century New Zealand lawyers","Battle of Crete","Burials at Karori Cemetery","Military personnel from Christchurch","New Zealand Companions of the Distinguished Service Order","New Zealand Companions of the Order of the Bath","New Zealand Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire","New Zealand amputees","New Zealand generals","New Zealand lawyers with disabilities","New Zealand military personnel","New Zealand military personnel of World War I","New Zealand military personnel of World War II","New Zealand people of German descent","People educated at Christchurch Boys' High School"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Howard Kippenberger?  \nA1: Howard Kippenberger was a New Zealand military leader, lawyer, and historian.

On August 30, 1997, late night service was permanently cut back from 179th Street to Court Square, with the F running local east of Queens Plaza replacing G service, meaning that the G only ran along the Queens Boulevard Line on weekdays. Evening service between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. was cut back from Queens Plaza to Court Square. On December 16, 2001, the 63rd Street Connector opened and Court Square became the northern terminal for the G train during weekdays, while G service was extended to Forest Hills\u201371st Avenue at all other times, which represented the reverse of the previous pattern. Service along the IND Queens Boulevard Line was replaced by the new train during weekdays. The G was to be truncated to Court Square at all times to make room for the V, but due to rider opposition it was cut back only on weekdays until 8:30 p.m. Four G trains in each direction ran to or from Church Avenue. The headway for weekday evening service increased from 12 minutes to 15 minutes, while the headway for rush hour and Saturday morning and afternoon service decreased from 10 minutes to 8 minutes. On April 27, 2003, Saturday morning and afternoon G service was decreased, with service running every 12 minutes instead of every 8 minutes, and Sunday afternoon service was decreased to run every 12 minutes instead of every 10 minutes. In addition, Saturday morning and afternoon G trains turned out of service at Fourth Avenue instead of Church Avenue. On July 5, 2009, the G was once again extended south at all times to Church Avenue. This was required for overhaul of the Culver Viaduct, which caused the express tracks at Smith\u2013Ninth Streets and Fourth Avenue\/Ninth Street\u2014used to switch G trains between tracks after they terminated at Smith\u2013Ninth Streets\u2014to be temporarily taken out of service. This had several benefits. First, five stations previously served by only the F train had more frequent service. Additionally, riders from northern Brooklyn and Long Island City had a direct route to Kensington. Finally, since the Church Avenue terminal had four tracks to store terminating G trains, as opposed to only one storage track at Smith\u20139th Streets, this reduced delays on both services because terminating G trains could switch to the storage tracks without having to wait in the station for another train to leave, as had occurred at Smith\u2013Ninth Street. On July 19, 2012, MTA officials made this extension permanent because it provided more direct connections between Kensington and north Brooklyn. Due to the MTA's financial crisis in the late 2000s, as well as continued capacity issues on the IND Queens Boulevard Line, the G was to be cut back from Forest Hills\u201371st Avenue to Court Square at all times beginning June 27, 2010. However, due to planned track repairs during the times the G normally ran on the Queens Boulevard Line, it ceased running on that line on April 19. In addition, train headways were increased, which inconvenienced about 201,000 weekly commuters since they had to wait longer for G trains. Flood waters from Hurricane Sandy caused significant damage to the Greenpoint Tubes under the Newtown Creek. Although the G was back in service days after the hurricane, the tube needed permanent repairs. To allow for these repairs, G service ran only between Nassau Avenue and Church Avenue for twelve weekends between July and December 2013. This schedule was also in effect daily between July 25 and September 2, 2014. ## Controversies\n\nIn the 21st century, the G suffered from a wide range of issues that has resulted in complaints by people living along the route. Historically, it has connected only Brooklyn and Queens, resulting in many people thinking of the G as the subway system's \"outcast\" and the \"unwanted drunk uncle everyone has.\" One reporter wrote of the G, \"[Riders] need it because it goes where no other train does, but they hate that they need it.\" Compounding to the G's \"outcast\" reputation, some of the G's stations along the Crosstown Line are in bad shape. Since 2001, however, a series of service cuts and missing connections to other lines has worsened public opinion of the G.\n\nOn December 16, 2001, the G's northern terminus was cut back from Forest Hills to Court Square during weekdays, and since April 2010, this service pattern has applied at all times. This service pattern not only puts more ridership pressure on the E route\u2014already one of the system's busiest before 2001\u2014but also resulted in G trains' lengths being shortened by one third, from 450 feet (140 m) or 6 cars to 300 feet (91 m) or 4. In addition, between 2001 and 2010, weekend service along the G to Forest Hills had been intermittent, with frequent service changes due to \"track work\". The 2010 route reduction did increase service frequency on the remainder of the route. Finally, the G has few transfers to other services, with missing transfer points to the at Broadway and the at Fulton Street, as well as a lack of an ADA-accessible transfer to the at Court Square.\n\n","h_score":1675690.2625000002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":1149401,"revid":1173189748,"description":"New York City Subway service","categories":["Independent Subway System","New York City Subway services"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the G train in the New York City Subway system?  \nA1: The G train is a vital subway service operated by the MTA, running entirely within Brooklyn and Queens without venturing into Manhattan.

By the time the segment starts, Milhouse has clearly developed some kind of lore surrounding him, because he begins to recite a parody of the Apostles' Creed recounting details about the Pumpkin. Milhouse travels to the pumpkin patch where he meets some of his friends, whom he invites to sing 'pumpkin carols'. Nelson makes one up telling Milhouse that he is 'such a stupid moron\/ It makes people want to punch [him]' and that the Grand Pumpkin is 'super gay', and even Ralph declares, 'Your God is wrong!' Lisa decides to wait with Milhouse. However, after Lisa sees everyone at school having a Halloween party, she grows tired of waiting and leaves in frustration. Milhouse starts to cry and his tears and childlike belief bring the Grand Pumpkin to life. However, the Pumpkin is appalled to find that his kindred pumpkins are being carved up on Halloween and made into pumpkin bread, originally thinking it was bread especially made for pumpkins until Milhouse revealed it is made from them, and vows revenge. He devours Homer as he carves a pumpkin, then marches to the school and eats Nelson who threatens to stab a yellow pumpkin. It becomes apparent at this point that the Grand Pumpkin is racist towards this type of pumpkin and then eats Groundskeeper Willie after being offered roasted pumpkin seeds. Realizing that Milhouse can bring things to life by believing in them, Lisa tells him about \"Tom Turkey\", a symbol of Thanksgiving. Milhouse starts to believe in Tom Turkey, who comes to life and kills the Grand Pumpkin, freeing everyone he ate. However, when Tom Turkey learns that people eat turkeys on Thanksgiving from Bart, he vows revenge and starts angrily chasing children around the school, devouring some of them whole as Marge wishes the viewers happy holidays.\n\n ## Production\n\nThe opening segment of the episode, which was leaked onto the internet weeks before the episode aired, features Homer voting for Barack Obama. Rather than taking sides in the election, executive producer Al Jean says it is \"mostly a comment on what many people to believe to be the irregularities in our voting system.\" \"Untitled Robot Parody\" is modeled on the live action Transformers film, rather than the cartoon. Al Jean said it was \"just really fun to do transformations [and] you can see why they enjoyed doing that film.\" \"How to Get Ahead in Dead-Vertising\" featured a parody of the title sequence of Mad Men. Jean was a fan of the series and pitched the scene.\n\nThe final segment is based on the Halloween cartoon It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. It could not be titled \"It's the Great Pumpkin, Milhouse\" to exactly match its namesake because of a \"big legal issue\", according to Al Jean. However, the characters were redesigned to resemble the style of Peanuts, and they also obtained rights to use Vince Guaraldi's music. Jean said in 2011 that \"For years we had never been able to parody Charlie Brown's Halloween special, which is one of the all-time top three animated shows ever. The Vince Guaraldi music is such a huge part of it, so we got to clear it. It was just a dream come true to satirize it. I thought it was a really funny idea that instead of not ever seeing the Grand Pumpkin, it comes to life, and he's really horrified at the way humans cook pumpkins into pies, and eat pumpkin seeds, which are basically pumpkin fetuses....\"\n\n","h_score":1673910.0687500001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":17530273,"revid":1154902572,"description":null,"categories":["2008 American television episodes","Animation controversies in television","Cultural depictions of Edward G.

Welsh ponies and cobs in all sections are known for their good temperament, hardiness, and free-moving gaits.\n\nNative ponies existed in Wales before 1600 BC, and a Welsh-type cob was known as early as the Middle Ages. They were influenced by the Arabian horse, and possibly also by the Thoroughbred and the Hackney horse. In 1901, the first stud book for the Welsh breeds was established in the United Kingdom, and in 1907 another registry was established in the United States. Interest in the breed declined during the Great Depression, but revived in the 1950s. Throughout their history, the Welsh breeds have had many uses, including as a cavalry horse, a pit pony, and as a working animal on farms.\n\nToday, the modern Welsh Pony and Cob breeds are used for many equestrian competitive disciplines, including showing, jumping, and driving, as well as for pleasure riding, trekking and trail riding. The smaller types are popular children's ponies. The Welsh also crosses well with many other breeds and has influenced the development of many British and American horse and pony breeds.\n\n","h_score":1683282.7625000002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":1644766,"revid":1153711037,"description":"Breed of horse","categories":["Animal breeds on the RBST Watchlist","Feral horses","Horse breeds","Horse breeds originating in Wales","Ponies"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Timeless Legacy of the Welsh Pony and Cob\n\nThe Welsh Pony and Cob is a versatile horse breed originating from Wales, celebrated for its adaptability in various equestrian activities.

The formula is part of federal weight and size regulations regarding interstate commercial traffic (intrastate traffic is subject to state limits). The formula is necessary to prevent heavy vehicles from damaging roads and bridges. CMVs are most often tractor-trailers or buses, but the formula is of most interest to truck drivers due to the heavy loads their vehicles often carry.\n\nEarly 20th-century weight limits were enacted to protect dirt and gravel roads from damage caused by the solid wheels of heavy trucks. As time passed, truck weight limits focused primarily on gross weight limits (which had no prescribed limits on length). By 1974, bridges received special protection from increasing truck weight limits. The bridge formula law was enacted by the U.S. Congress to limit the weight-to-length ratio of heavy trucks, and to protect roads and bridges from the damage caused by the concentrated weight of shorter trucks. The formula effectively lowers the legal weight limit for shorter trucks, preventing them from causing premature deterioration of bridges and highway infrastructure.\n\nCompliance with the law is checked when vehicles pass through a weigh station, often located at the borders between states or on the outskirts of major cities, where the vehicle may be weighed and measured. The one exception to the formula allows a standard five-axle semi-truck configuration to weigh the maximum legal gross weight. This exception was specifically requested by the American Trucking Associations to allow tank trucks to reach the maximum legal gross weight without violating the bridge formula law.\n\n ## History\n\nThe first truck weight limits were enacted by four states in 1913, ranging from 18,000 pounds (8,200 kg) in Maine to 28,000 pounds (13,000 kg) in Massachusetts. These laws were passed to protect earth and gravel-surfaced roads from damage caused by the steel and solid rubber wheels of early heavy trucks. By 1933, all states had some form of truck weight regulation. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 instituted the first federal truck weight regulation (set at 73,280 pounds or 33,240 kilograms) and authorized the construction of the Interstate Highway System.\n\nIn the late 1950s, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) conducted a series of extensive field tests of roads and bridges to determine how traffic contributed to the deterioration of pavement materials. In 1964, the AASHTO recommended to Congress that a bridge formula table be used instead of a single gross weight limit for trucks. The Federal-Aid Highway Act Amendments of 1974 established the bridge formula as law, along with the gross weight limit of 80,000 pounds (36,000 kg). Current applications of the formula allow for up to 7 axles and 86 feet or more length between axle sets, and a maximum load of 105,500 lbs.\n\n","h_score":1685626.03125,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":15581883,"revid":1158258603,"description":"Formula for estimating bridge weight limits","categories":["Bridges in the United States","Trucking industry in the United States","Trucks","United States Department of Transportation","United States transportation law","Vehicle law"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Understanding the Federal Bridge Gross Weight Formula\n\nThe Federal Bridge Gross Weight Formula is a U.S. regulation used to calculate the maximum allowable weight for vehicles on bridges, ensuring structural integrity and safety. This formula, established under federal law, helps prevent damage to infrastructure and reduces risks for drivers and the public.\n\n#### What the Formula Entails\nThe Federal Bridge Gross Weight Formula, part of the Federal-Aid Highway Act, determines safe weight limits based on factors like axle spacing, vehicle weight, and bridge design. It applies to interstate highways and is enforced by state and federal agencies to standardize weight restrictions across the country.\n\n#### How It Operates in Practice\nThe formula calculates gross vehicle weight by considering the number of axles and their distances, using a specific equation to avoid overloading bridges. \"This tool is essential for maintaining bridge longevity,\" said Robert Thompson, a civil engineer with the American Society of Civil Engineers. Enforcement involves weigh stations and fines for violations, helping to protect aging infrastructure from potential failures.\n\n#### Its Role in Transportation Safety\nBy setting clear weight guidelines, the formula minimizes accidents and costly repairs, influencing truck routing and load planning. \"Adhering to these standards saves lives and money,\" noted Sarah Ellis, a policy analyst at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Overall, it promotes efficient and secure freight movement nationwide.\n\nLooking ahead, updates to the formula may incorporate new technologies like advanced sensors to enhance real-time monitoring and enforcement."}

By murdering his godfather, Sir William Douglas of Liddesdale, William became the undisputed head of the House of Douglas. He was created Earl of Douglas in 1358.\n\nIt is not clear how Douglas came to possess Tantallon, but in correspondence of 1374, he refers to it as \"our castle of Temptaloun\". Douglas may have been made castellan of Tantallon, as a tenant of Isabella, Countess of Fife, and it appears that he built the present castle either shortly before, or shortly after his elevation to the peerage, to reflect his new-found status. It was intended as a status symbol, although it followed the medieval curtain wall type, which at the time was becoming outmoded and superseded by the tower house. The Douglases continued to hold the lands of Tantallon as tenants of Robert Stewart, Earl of Fife (c.1340-1420), from 1371 until 1372, when he resigned the title in favour of his son, Murdoch Stewart. Tantallon was the home of William Douglas' sister-in-law and mistress, Margaret Stewart, 4th Countess of Angus, the mother of his illegitimate son, George Douglas (1380\u20131403). In 1377, the Earl of Angus made his close friend, Alan de Lawedre of The Bass, Constable of Tantallon Castle, an office he held until at least 1389. In 1388, when the 2nd Earl of Douglas died, the Earl of Fife claimed the lands of Tantallon, and confirmed the Countess' right to live there. Several attempts were made to dislodge the Countess, but an agreement was formalised by Parliament in April 1389, and George Douglas was recognised as Earl of Angus, being the heir of his mother.\n\n","h_score":1685014.7000000002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":3416349,"revid":1153671772,"description":"Castle in Scotland","categories":["14th-century establishments in Scotland","14th-century fortifications","Castles in East Lothian","Historic house museums in East Lothian","House of Douglas and Angus","North Berwick","Reportedly haunted locations in Scotland","Scheduled Ancient Monuments in East Lothian","Wars of Scottish Independence","Wars of the Three Kingdoms"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What exactly is Tantallon Castle, you ask?  \nA1: Tantallon Castle is a dramatic medieval ruin perched like a stony sentinel on the rugged cliffs of East Lothian, Scotland, whispering tales of ancient battles and noble intrigue.

Their most recent appearance in the final was the first at Wembley, which they lost in 2008 to Tottenham. The game was Chelsea's first domestic cup final since their victory in the 2012 FA Cup final. Incumbent Chelsea manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was in charge in their League Cup wins in 2005 and 2007, and squad members Petr \u010cech, John Terry and Didier Drogba played in both finals, with the latter scoring in both victories. All three also played in the 2008 defeat by Tottenham.\n\nTottenham were making their eighth appearance in the final, having won four previous times, last of which was in 2008. The 2008 final was the first at Wembley and was won against Chelsea. Tottenham's most recent appearance was a defeat against Manchester United in a penalty shootout the following year. Of their squad in the 2014\u201315 season, captain Younes Kaboul was an extra-time substitute in their 2008 victory, while Aaron Lennon \u2013 on loan at Everton at the time of the 2015 final \u2013 started that match and the defeat in 2009.\n\nThe two teams also played at the old Wembley in the 1967 FA Cup final, which Tottenham won 2\u20131. Tottenham's most recent appearance at Wembley was also against Chelsea, a 5\u20131 defeat in an FA Cup semi-final in 2012.\n\nBy the time of the final, Chelsea and Tottenham had already played each other twice during the league season. On 3 December 2014, Chelsea hosted a 3\u20130 win, with goals from Eden Hazard, Didier Drogba and substitute Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my, despite missing leading scorer Diego Costa through suspension. Tottenham won the reverse fixture 5\u20133 only 29 days later, with Harry Kane scoring twice among further goals from Danny Rose, Andros Townsend (penalty) and Nacer Chadli.\n\n ## Route to the final\n\n ### Chelsea\n\nChelsea, of the Premier League, began their League Cup campaign in the third round, where they were drawn at home against Bolton Wanderers of the Championship. Defender Kurt Zouma, making his debut, opened the scoring, but Bolton equalised six minutes later through a Matt Mills header. Ten minutes after the start of the second half, Oscar put Chelsea back into the lead and they won 2\u20131, dominating the match with 28 shots to Bolton's 3.\n\nIn the fourth round, Chelsea travelled to the New Meadow to face Shrewsbury Town of League Two. Three minutes after play resumed from a goalless first half, Didier Drogba's half-volley gave Chelsea the lead, but Shrewsbury gained an equaliser from substitute Andy Mangan. With nine minutes to play, Chelsea regained the advantage when Shrewsbury defender Jermaine Grandison deflected a shot from Willian.\n\nChelsea again were the away team to a lower opponent in the quarter-finals, facing Derby County of the Championship. In the first half, Eden Hazard gave Chelsea the lead, later doubled by a Filipe Lu\u00eds free kick, the full-back's first for Chelsea. Craig Bryson halved the deficit for Derby, but soon afterwards defender Jake Buxton was sent off for a foul on Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my and Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle scored the final goal of a 3\u20131 Chelsea win. In the semi-final, Chelsea beat Liverpool 2\u20131 on aggregate after Branislav Ivanovi\u0107 scored the winning goal in the first half of extra time in the second leg, heading in Willian's free kick.\n\n ### Tottenham Hotspur\n\nTottenham, also of the Premier League, began by facing Nottingham Forest at White Hart Lane. After a goalless first half, Jorge Grant gave the visitors from the Championship the lead in the 65th minute. Substitute Ryan Mason equalised six minutes later, and Spurs eventually won 3\u20131 after two late goals from Roberto Soldado and another substitute, Harry Kane.\n\nTottenham hosted another second-tier opponent in the fourth round, Brighton & Hove Albion, and went into the lead through Erik Lamela, a half-time replacement for Aaron Lennon. Kane later confirmed a 2\u20130 victory.\n\nIn the quarter-finals, Tottenham again played at home, against top-flight Newcastle United. Away goalkeeper Jak Alnwick made a mistake which allowed Nabil Bentaleb to give Spurs a half-time lead. Nacer Chadli doubled it 36 seconds into the second half. Kane and his replacement Soldado also scored in the 4\u20130 victory. Tottenham's semi-final against League One club Sheffield United started with a 1\u20130 home win, Andros Townsend converting a penalty won by Jay McEveley's handball. A week later in the second leg at Bramall Lane, Tottenham doubled their aggregate lead with Christian Eriksen's free kick, but in the second half 18-year-old substitute Ch\u00e9 Adams scored twice to equalise the aggregate. With two minutes remaining, Eriksen scored his second to put Tottenham into the final.\n\n ## Match\n\n ### Pre-match\n\nTottenham were eliminated from the last 32 of the 2014\u201315 UEFA Europa League by Fiorentina three days before the final, leading manager Mauricio Pochettino to say that the team needed to recover quickly.\n\nChelsea manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho used his pre-match interview to state that his previous wins in the tournament had changed the way that clubs approach the League Cup: \"Lots of teams have followed us since then when we took the League Cup as a real competition, as a real challenge. It is a big competition.\" He separated the final from the league season, saying, \"I don't think if we win the cup final we will win the league, or if we lose it we will lose the league.\" He refused to discuss the suspension of Mati\u0107, dismissing it with \"If I speak to you about that, I promise you I will be in big trouble\". Despite opining that the two teams and the match officials would act fairly, he criticised players who dive, despite not naming any names. Mourinho also claimed that in after leaving Chelsea for the first time in September 2007, he was approached to manage Tottenham by chairman Daniel Levy, and again in 2012.\n\n ### Team selection\n\nChelsea midfielder Nemanja Mati\u0107 was suspended for the final, due to a two-match ban he received for pushing over Burnley's Ashley Barnes in a league match on 21 February 2015. Another central midfielder for the club, John Obi Mikel, missed the match through a knee injury. Due to Mati\u0107's absence, Kurt Zouma \u2013 usually a central defender \u2013 moved into defensive midfield, with Gary Cahill introduced into Zouma's previous position. Chelsea made four other changes from their draw with Burnley: Petr \u010cech started in goal in place of Thibaut Courtois, C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta at left-back instead of Filipe Lu\u00eds, and Ramires and Willian came into the midfield at the expense of Juan Cuadrado and Oscar. Chelsea set up with a three-man attack, with Eden Hazard and Willian wide of Diego Costa.\n\nTottenham's second-choice goalkeeper Michel Vorm had played all of their fixtures on their way to the final, but was dropped to the bench and replaced with Hugo Lloris for the decisive game. Compared to their defeat at Fiorentina, Tottenham made three changes in defence, with only Jan Vertonghen retaining his place \u2013 Vlad Chiriche\u0219, Federico Fazio and Ben Davies were replaced by Kyle Walker, Eric Dier and Danny Rose, with Chiriche\u0219 not even featuring on the substitutes' bench. Defensive midfielder Benjamin Stambouli and attacking midfielder Erik Lamela were replaced by Ryan Mason and Andros Townsend respectively, with the lone striker position changing from Roberto Soldado to Harry Kane.\n\n ### Summary\n\nIn the 10th minute, Christian Eriksen had the first meaningful shot, hitting the crossbar with a 25-yard free kick for Tottenham. Twenty minutes later, Eric Dier was given the game's first yellow card for a foul on Diego Costa. At the end of the first half, Chelsea won a free kick on their right side when Branislav Ivanovi\u0107 was pulled down by Nacer Chadli. Willian took the free kick, which arrived at Kurt Zouma, played it down to captain John Terry. Terry's shot \u2013 Chelsea's first on target \u2013 went past Hugo Lloris due to a deflection by Dier. In added time at the end of the first half, Gary Cahill had a header from a corner, which was caught by Lloris.\n\nNeither side made a substitution at half time. In the 56th minute, Cesc F\u00e0bregas \u2013 who had a bicycle kick saved by Lloris \u2013 set up Diego Costa, whose shot from the left of the area deflected off Tottenham right-back Kyle Walker and into the net to double Chelsea's advantage. After conceding their second goal, Tottenham made a series of attacking substitutions \u2013 Andros Townsend, Ryan Mason and Chadli made way for Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Erik Lamela and Roberto Soldado respectively \u2013 but could not change the score. In the 74th minute, Dier's knee caught C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, drawing blood; the Chelsea left-back left the pitch to be bandaged and returned two minutes later. There were four minutes of added time, in which Chelsea substituted Costa for Didier Drogba.\n\n ### Details\n\n ## Post-match\n\nMourinho was pleased to have won the final, earning the 21st trophy of his managerial career: \"I am like a kid winning the first one, it's hard for me to live without titles. I need to feed myself with them.\" Terry was optimistic about the club's prospects for the future, saying, \"It is the start of something... we've got a great squad, with some great young players, and hungry and experienced players too. It's a great mix.\" Although praising the atmosphere at Wembley, Terry ruled out returning to the England team, for whom he had not played since 2012. Despite losing, Pochettino expressed pride in his team's performance.\n\nMati\u0107 took part in Chelsea's trophy ceremony in full kit despite being suspended, similar to what Terry had done after Chelsea won the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final with him suspended. Mourinho did not concur with the official man of the match award going to Terry, stating that the honour should have gone to Thibaut Courtois and Filipe Lu\u00eds for their performances against Liverpool, and Andreas Christensen for his performance against Shrewsbury Town.\n\nChelsea qualified for the next season's UEFA Europa League by winning the match. As they qualified for the UEFA Champions League by winning the Premier League, the Europa League place went to Liverpool, who finished sixth in the Premier League.","h_score":1687872.09375,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":43804905,"revid":1150180665,"description":null,"categories":["2014\u201315 Football League","2014\u201315 in English football","2015 sports events in London","Chelsea F.C. matches","EFL Cup finals","Events at Wembley Stadium","March 2015 sports events in the United Kingdom","Tottenham Hotspur F.C. matches"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What was the 2015 Football League Cup final?  \nA1: The 2015 Football League Cup final was the decisive match of the competition, also known as the League Cup or EFL Cup, which is an annual knockout tournament in English football.

Critic Lisa Zeidner argues that the artist's \"loyalty and love\" involved with creating originality counters Bigend's assertion that everything is a reflection of something else and that the creative process no longer rests with the individual. Commercialism is portrayed as a monoculture that assimilates originality. The Tommy Hilfiger brand is used as an example, \"simulacra of simulacra of simulacra. A dilute tincture of Ralph Lauren, who had himself diluted the glory days of Brooks Brothers, who themselves had stepped on the product of Jermyn Street and Savile Row ... There must be some Tommy Hilfiger event horizon, beyond which it is impossible to be more derivative, more removed from the source, more devoid of soul.\"\n\nOne critic points out that the marketing agency Blue Ant is named after the wasp Blue Ant: \"it's a wasp with a painful sting. The female hunts for a ground-dwelling cricket. She paralyses it with a sting and lays her egg on it. The still living yet immobile cricket becomes food for the wasp's young. What a clever metaphor for the process of targeting, commodifying, and marketing cool.\" On the other hand, as Rudy Rucker notes, while new art is constantly threatened by commodification, it is dependent on the monoculture for its launching point and uniqueness. Gibson's product positioning language and Cayce's analysis of consumerist trends show that society is not a victim of consumerism, but rather its creator who helps shape it without ever stepping outside it. Alex Link argues that rather than a simple attack on consumerism outright, the novel outlines a complex interrelationship between art, brand design, and terrorism as varying attitudes to history, terror, and community.\n\n ### Branding, identity, and globalization\n\nThe novel's language is viewed as rife with labeling and product placements. Postmodern theorist Fredric Jameson calls it \"a kind of hyped-up name-dropping ... [where] an encyclopaedic familiarity with the fashions ... [creates] class status as a matter of knowing the score rather than of having money and power\". He also calls it \"postmodern nominalism\" in that the names express the new and fashionable. This name-dropping demonstrates how commercialism has created and named new objects and experiences and renamed (or re-created) some that already existed. This naming includes nationalities; there are eight references to nationality (or locality) in the first three pages. Zeidner wrote that the novel's \"new century is unsettlingly transitional making it difficult to maintain an individual identity\". One character argues that \"there will soon be no national identity left ... [as] all experience [will be] reduced, by the spectral hand of marketing, to price-point variations on the same thing.\" This is juxtaposed against the footage that contains no hints of time period or location. Globalization is represented by characters of varying nationalities, ease of international travel, portable instant communication, and commercial monoculture recognizable across international markets. As an example, Gibson writes how one 'yes or no' decision by Cayce on the logo will impact the lives of the people in remote places who will manufacture the logos and how it will infect their dreams.\n\n","h_score":1640284.4187500002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":265667,"revid":1149417674,"description":"2003 novel by William Gibson","categories":["2003 American novels","English-language novels","Fiction set in 2002","G.

It was the group's first foray into soul music and was heavily influenced by the R&B of Motown and Stax Records. The album was the band's worst-selling at that point, charting at number 24 in the US. Lead single \"Wild Honey\" peaked at number 31, while its follow-up \"Darlin'\" reached number 19. In the UK, the album peaked at number seven.\n\nThe album's sessions began immediately after the recording of Lei'd in Hawaii, a failed live album, and the release of Smiley Smile, their previous LP. Like Smiley Smile, Wild Honey's core instrumental combo consists of organ, honky-tonk piano, and electric bass. The Beach Boys were inspired to regroup as a self-contained rock band, partly in response to critical assertions that they were \"ball-less choir boys\". They also purposely distanced themselves from the prevailing rock trends of the time, which had been typified by psychedelia and high-scale recording or thematic conceits.\n\nIt was the second album to credit \"the Beach Boys\" as producer instead of Brian Wilson, who gradually withdrew from the band following the difficult sessions for the aborted Smile project. At his request, bandmate Carl Wilson began contributing more to the recording process, a trend that continued on subsequent albums. Mike Love also returned as Brian's main songwriting collaborator for the first time since Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!) (1965). It was the last Beach Boys album to feature Brian as a primary composer until The Beach Boys Love You (1977).\n\nWild Honey presaged a back-to-basics approach that was subsequently adopted by the Beach Boys' contemporaries, including Bob Dylan and the Beatles, and it is credited with pioneering the DIY pop genre. Most critics initially disregarded the record, but after the mid\u20131970s, a greater appreciation formed around its simplicity and charm. In 1979, the track \"Here Comes the Night\" was redone by the group as a disco single. In 2020, Wild Honey was ranked number 410 on Rolling Stone's list of the greatest albums of all time. A remixed and expanded edition, titled 1967 \u2013 Sunshine Tomorrow, was released in 2017.\n\n","h_score":1659748.39375,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":719500,"revid":1171764871,"description":null,"categories":["1967 albums","Albums produced by the Beach Boys","Albums recorded at Wally Heider Studios","Albums recorded in a home studio","Capitol Records albums","Lo-fi music albums","Pop rock albums by American artists","Soul albums by American artists","The Beach Boys albums"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is \"Wild Honey\" and who created it?  \nA1: \"Wild Honey\" is the 13th studio album by the American rock band The Beach Boys.

None of the Republican senators who voted for acquittal ever again served in an elected office. Although they were under intense pressure to change their votes to conviction during the trial, afterward public opinion rapidly shifted around to their viewpoint. Some senators who voted for conviction, such as John Sherman and even Charles Sumner, later changed their minds.\n\nAs the select committee that wrote them intended, the impeachment trial rules outlined for Johnson's impeachment indeed have been permanent, used in all subsequent federal impeachment trials with very few alterations. The impeachment rules were not altered again after the Johnson trial until the 1935 trial of Harold Louderback saw a single rule change. In the 1970s, the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration looked at possibly again changing the rules in advance of the anticipated impeachment trial that might have followed the impeachment process against Richard Nixon, but after to the resignation of Richard Nixon, this was momentarily abandoned. The rule changes considered in the 1970s were not adopted until the Senate acted upon a further recommendation to adopt them in 1986. No further changes have been made to the rules outlined for the Johnson trial.\n\nSome have argued that the acquittal was an acknowledgement of an understanding that impeachment should be used to address abuses of power and violations of public trust, but not as a means for settling political and policy disputes between the Congress and a president.\n\nThe impeachment is regarded as having been part of a greater battle over the balance between the balance of power between the legislative branch (Congress) and the executive branch of the United States federal government. The impeachment and trial of Andrew Johnson had important political implications for the balance between federal legislative branch and executive branch power. It reinforced the principle that Congress should not remove the president from office simply because its members disagreed with him over policy, style, and administration of the office. It also resulted in diminished presidential influence on public policy and overall governing power, fostering a system of governance which future-President Woodrow Wilson referred to in the 1880s as \"Congressional Government\". The latter dynamic would likely have been heightened had Johnson been convicted in his trial.\n\n ### Scapegoating by Radical Republicans\n\nSome Radical Republicans, looking for a scapegoat to blame for their failure to secure the conviction of Johnson, blamed Chief Justice Chase, accusing him of having swayed the decisions of senators against conviction. Contrarily, he received Democratic praise, with the closing clause of the party platform adopted at the 1868 Democratic National Convention resolving, \"that the thanks of the convention are tendered to Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase for the justice, dignity, and impartiality with which he presided over the court of impeachment on the trial of President Andrew Johnson.\"\n\nAnother individual that became a scapegoat for Radical Republicans' failure to secure a conviction was sculptor Vinnie Ream. Senator Ross had been boarding at the home of Ream's family during the trial, and Ream was accused after the trial of having persuaded Ross to vote against conviction. In the aftermath of the trial, Ream was initially ordered to vacate Room A of the United States Capitol, which she had been using as a studio for sculpting her government-commissioned statue of Abraham Lincoln. The House had voted on May 28, 1868 (two days after the trial adjourned) to turn that room into a guard room for the United States Capitol Police. However, Ream received support from powerful New York sculptors and the assistance her friend Thaddeus Stevens (who had been an impeachment manager) in securing the subsequent passage of a resolution by the House granting her permission to utilize the space as a studio for another year.\n\n","h_score":1684680.4312500001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":41561328,"revid":1162520243,"description":"1868 U.S. Senate trial","categories":["Benjamin Butler","Impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Andrew Johnson, and why is his impeachment a wild chapter in American history?  \nA1: Andrew Johnson was the 17th President, stepping into the spotlight after Lincoln's assassination like a reluctant understudy in a tragedy. He clashed with Congress over Reconstruction, setting the stage for a dramatic power struggle that painted him as a defiant Southerner in a Northern-led show.\n\nQ2: What exactly sparked the impeachment process against him?  \nA2: The spark came from Johnson's fiery clashes with Radical Republicans, who accused him of undermining their post-Civil War plans. He fired Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, defying the Tenure of Office Act in a bold move that screamed \"challenge accepted\" to his critics.\n\nQ3: When and where did the impeachment trial take place?  \nA3: The trial unfolded in the U.S. Senate in 1868, turning that grand chamber into a tense arena of accusations and defenses. It lasted from March to May, like a high-stakes courtroom drama under the Capitol's watchful dome.\n\nQ4: What were the main charges leveled against Johnson?  \nA4: The big charge was violating the Tenure of Office Act by dismissing Stanton, plus a handful of other \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" that painted him as a reckless executive. It was less about outright corruption and more about a power play wrapped in legal ribbons.\n\nQ5: How did the trial proceed, with its unexpected twists?  \nA5: The Senate acted as both jury and audience, with Chief Justice Salmon Chase presiding like a stern ringmaster. Witnesses testified, debates raged, and the vote came down to the wire, turning allies into wild cards in this political circus.\n\nQ6: Who were the key players in this historical spectacle?  \nA6: Thaddeus Stevens led the charge for the House managers, portraying Johnson as the villain, while defense attorney William Evarts countered with sharp wit. Senators like Edmund Ross became unlikely heroes, their votes swinging like pendulums in the balance.\n\nQ7: What was the final outcome of the trial?  \nA7: Johnson was acquitted by a single vote, narrowly escaping removal in a moment that felt like dodging a bullet in slow motion. This close call preserved the presidency but left scars on the nation's healing process.\n\nQ8: How did Johnson's impeachment shape American politics in the long run?  \nA8: It set a precedent for future impeachments, highlighting the checks on executive power like a cautionary tale etched in stone. Unexpectedly, it strengthened congressional authority during turbulent times, influencing how we view presidential limits today with a mix of awe and wariness."}

Intended for service in the German colonial empire, the ship was designed with a combination of steam and sail power for extended range, and was equipped with a battery of ten 15-centimeter (5.9 in) guns. Olga was laid down at the AG Vulcan in Stettin in 1879, she was launched in December 1880, and she was completed in January 1882.\n\nIn the course of her career, Olga was sent abroad on three major deployments. The first, uneventful voyage came in 1882, and took the vessel to South American waters for a year and a half. During the cruise, Prince Heinrich of Prussia served aboard the ship. The second cruise came shortly thereafter, when the German Admiralty sent her to the German colony of Kamerun as part of the West African Squadron to suppress a rebellion against German rule. Her third cruise took place between 1885 and 1889, and saw the ship alternate between German East Africa and German New Guinea in the central Pacific Ocean. While in Samoa in 1889, Olga was badly damaged by a powerful cyclone and was forced to leave the station for repairs.\n\nFrom 1890, Olga saw limited service, in a variety of subsidiary roles. She was used as a training ship from 1893 to 1897, when she was transferred to the Fishery School. She conducted an extensive survey in Spitzbergen in 1898 before being decommissioned late in the year, to be converted into a gunnery training ship. She served in that capacity until 1905, when she was stricken from the naval register. Olga was sold for scrap the following year and was broken up in 1908.\n\n","h_score":1664548.4812500002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":55547393,"revid":1164591975,"description":"Screw corvette of the German Imperial Navy","categories":["1880 ships","Carola-class corvettes","Maritime incidents in March 1889","Ships built in Stettin"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is SMS Olga?  \nA1: SMS Olga was a light cruiser in the German Imperial Navy, built in the late 19th century as part of a fleet that patrolled distant waters with grace and precision.

They form a potassium-rich calc-alkaline suite. Both contain pumices, three different types of which are found in the Atana ignimbrite. Phenocrysts within the ignimbrite are chiefly formed by plagioclase.\n\nBoth the Atana and the Toconao ignimbrite include minerals like allanite, apatite, biotite, epidote, hornblende, ilmenite, magnetite, monazite, orthopyroxene, plagioclase, quartz, sanidine, titanite and zircon. Not all of these minerals are found in both ignimbrites, and not always in the same phase (crystals or matrix).\n\nUltimately, the magmas at La Pacana are the products of mantle melts interacting with various crustal domains deep in the crust, within the partially molten zone that has been found at depths of c. 20 kilometres (12 mi) beneath the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex.\n\nVarious geothermometers indicate that the Toconao ignimbrite was colder than the Atana ignimbrite; temperatures have been estimated at 730\u2013750 \u00b0C (1,350\u20131,380 \u00b0F) and 750\u2013790 \u00b0C (1,380\u20131,450 \u00b0F) respectively. While the depth at which the Toconao ignimbrite formed is unknown, the Atana ignimbrite formed at a depth of 7\u20138.5 kilometres (4.3\u20135.3 mi). Such a formation depth is comparable to depths estimated for other magmatic systems such as Fish Canyon, Long Valley and Yellowstone.\n\n ## Climate and biota\n\nWeather records are available for the Salar de Aguas Calientes. There, an average temperature of 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F) and average precipitation of 150 millimetres per year (5.9 in\/year) have been recorded.\n\nThere is little vegetation in the dry Altiplano.

It was the last silver coin of that denomination to be struck before passage of the Coinage Act of 1873, which temporarily ended production of the silver dollar for American commerce. The coin's obverse is based on that of the Gobrecht dollar, which had been minted experimentally from 1836 to 1839. However, the soaring eagle used on the reverse of the Gobrecht dollar was not used; instead, the United States Mint (Mint) used a heraldic eagle, based on a design by late Mint Chief Engraver John Reich first utilized on coins in 1807.\n\nSeated Liberty dollars were initially struck only at the Philadelphia Mint; in 1846, production began at the New Orleans facility. In the late 1840s, the price of silver increased relative to gold because of an increase in supply of the latter caused by the California Gold Rush; this led to the hoarding, export, and melting of American silver coins. The Coinage Act of 1853 decreased the weight of all silver coins of five cents or higher, except for the dollar, but also required a supplemental payment from those wishing their bullion struck into dollar coins. As little silver was being presented to the US Mint at the time, production remained low. In the final years of the series, there was more silver produced in the US, and mintages increased.\n\nIn 1866, \"In God We Trust\" was added to the dollar following its introduction to United States coinage earlier in the decade. Seated Liberty dollar production was halted by the Coinage Act of 1873, which authorized the trade dollar for use in foreign commerce. Representatives of silver interests were unhappy when the metal's price dropped again in the mid-1870s; they advocated the resumption of the free coinage of silver into legal tender, and after the passage of the Bland\u2013Allison Act in 1878, production resumed with the Morgan dollar.\n\n","h_score":1683141.9125000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":2205026,"revid":1173255450,"description":"United States silver dollar coin minted from 1840 to 1873","categories":["1840 introductions","Eagles on coins","Goddess of Liberty on coins","United States dollar coins","United States silver coins"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's the Seated Liberty dollar, anyway?  \nA1: Picture this: a shiny silver coin from old-school America, featuring Lady Liberty lounging on a rock like she's the queen of freedom's throne.

According to a statement in Jordanes's Getica, Germanus was a descendant of the noble Roman clan of the Anicii. The exact nature of his connection, however, if indeed it is anything more than a literary device to indicate noble descent, is unclear. Theodor Mommsen hypothesized that his mother could have been a daughter of Anicia Juliana. During the reign of Emperor Justin I, he was raised to high office (he is recorded as a vir illustris in a 519 letter addressed to him by Pope Hormisdas), eventually being appointed as magister militum per Thraciae. In this capacity, he scored a crushing victory over an invasion of the Antae.\n\nBy 536, he was raised to the honorary consulate and the rank of patricius, and held the post of magister militum praesentalis. In that year, he was sent to North Africa to succeed Solomon as military commander, with the task of suppressing a large-scale mutiny of the Byzantine troops led by Stotzas. His tenure there, described by Procopius, was a thorough success. By appearing conciliatory and paying the arrears, he won over a large part of the mutinous army. He then defeated the remaining rebels under Stotzas at the Battle of Scalas Veteres in the spring of 537 and stabilized the situation by suppressing another conspiracy amongst his troops (cf. Maximinus) and restoring discipline.\n\nGermanus was recalled by Emperor Justinian in 539, and sent to Antioch in 540 at the outbreak of the Lazic War with Sassanid Persia. Heavily outnumbered by the Persians, he retreated to Cilicia and was unable to prevent the catastrophic sack of Antioch in the same year. In the next year, as Belisarius assumed command in the East, Germanus returned to Constantinople.\n\n ### Conspiracy of Artabanes\n\nBy 548, he was acknowledged as the most influential of Emperor Justinian's relatives and his heir apparent, although this was never formally recognized. In that year, his position was strengthened further by the death of Empress Theodora, who disliked him intensely. His stature at court was such that a plot was hatched by the disaffected general Artabanes and his kinsman Arsaces to assassinate Emperor Justinian and replace him with Germanus. The conspirators thought Germanus amenable to their plans, since he had been dissatisfied with Emperor Justinian's meddling in the settling of the will of his recently deceased brother Boraides.\n\nThe conspirators first told Justin, Germanus's eldest son, of their intentions. He, in turn, informed his father, who then held counsel with the comes excubitorum, Marcellus. In order to find out more of their intentions, Germanus met the conspirators in person, while a trusted aide of Marcellus, named Leontius, was concealed nearby and listened in. Marcellus then informed Emperor Justinian, and the conspirators were arrested, but treated with remarkable leniency. At first, Germanus and his sons too were suspected, until the testimony of Marcellus and the commanders Constantianus and Bouzes cleared them.\n\n","h_score":1688238.58125,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":1706377,"revid":1147234370,"description":"Byzantine general","categories":["550 deaths","6th-century Byzantine people","Anicii","Byzantine North Africa","Generals of Justinian I","Justinian dynasty","Magistri militum","Year of birth unknown"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Germanus: The Shadow Emperor's Kin\n\nIn the opulent haze of Byzantium's golden age, Germanus, cousin to the mighty Justinian I, emerged as a formidable general and political schemer, navigating the treacherous currents of imperial power with cunning and ambition. Yet, his story, often eclipsed by Justinian's grand conquests, reveals a man whose loyalty and rivalries shaped the empire's fate in unexpected ways.\n\n#### Rise from the Ranks\nGermanus, born into the aristocratic folds of the Byzantine elite, leveraged his familial ties to Justinian to climb the military ladder, transforming from a mere officer into a key commander during the reconquest of lost territories. His early exploits in the Balkans and Italy showcased a blend of strategic brilliance and raw tenacity, painting him as a warrior-poet in the epic tapestry of sixth-century warfare. As Procopius, the era's chronicler, once noted, \"Germanus possessed a mind as sharp as his sword, turning battles into ballets of blood and strategy.\"\n\n#### Intrigues and Alliances\nAmid the swirling intrigues of Justinian's court, Germanus balanced alliances with emperors and enemies alike, eyeing the throne as a potential heir while commanding armies against Persian and Gothic foes. His diplomatic maneuvers, often laced with subtle betrayals, highlighted the era's volatile power dynamics, where loyalty was as fleeting as a desert mirage. Modern historian Edward Gibbon reflected, \"In Germanus, we see the archetype of the reluctant kingmaker, whose ambitions flickered like stars in the vast imperial night.\"\n\n#### Echoes in History\nThough Germanus's life ended without seizing the crown, his influence lingered in the empire's military reforms and succession debates, leaving a legacy as enigmatic as the mosaics of Ravenna. As scholars continue to unearth Byzantine secrets, his tale underscores the fragility of power in a world of shifting sands.\n\nLooking ahead, Germanus's saga invites modern reflections on how overlooked figures still mold the undercurrents of history today."}

It is mainly black, with a silky blue-green gloss to the head, becoming distinctly green on the back and wing coverts. The underparts, other than the brownish under-wings, are purple-black, and the flight feathers are black. The black square tail is 4.8 cm (1.9 in) long, and the soft feather shafts project beyond the barbed section. This feature is most pronounced in the two central feathers, which in the related white-eyed river martin are greatly elongated. The African river martin has brown legs with a 1.5 cm (0.59 in) long tarsus, red eyes, pink eye-rings, and a broad orange-red bill. The wing length averages 14 cm (5.5 in).\n\nThe sexes are similar in appearance. There are many bird species in which there is sexual dichromatism that is not apparent to the human eye, but spectroscopic analysis of this martin's head feathers suggests that the colour differences between the sexes are small even to the birds' perception. Juveniles are duller and have sooty brown heads.

Approximately 64,695 Pounds of Shark Fins","reference":"### District court In 2004 the government went before Moskowitz seeking summary judgement. The case turned on whether the KD II was a fishing vessel under the SFPA. Early in 2005 he issued his ruling, holding that while it was not directly engaged in fishing it was nevertheless engaging in activities supporting fishing and thus also subject to the SFPA. He did not grant the forfeiture as NOAA had not moved for it yet. The SFPA deferred to the Magnuson\u2013Stevens Act for its definition of a fishing vessel. According to that statute, a fishing vessel was one that either engaged in fishing, or \"aiding or assisting one or more vessels at sea in the performance of any activity relating to fishing, including, but not limited to, preparation, supply, storage, refrigeration, transportation, or processing.\" Moskowitz rejected NOAA's argument that the KD II was engaged in fishing and therefore a fishing vessel because, under its previous ownership, it had been equipped with longline equipment and held a federal permit. That had lapsed shortly after Tran and Yu bought the ship and was no longer valid, so neither was the argument based on paper. \"Whether the KD II is in fact a fishing vessel under [the first definition] depends on its configuration and how it was outfitted at the time of the seizure\", he wrote. Since there was nothing in the record about that, he declined to decide the question on that grounds. There was more to consider when Moskowitz turned to the support aspect. \"Simply put, the issue in this case narrows down to whether the KD II is a vessel which was used for, equipped to be used for, or of a type which is normally used for aiding or assisting one or more vessels at sea in the performance of any activity relating to fishing.\" On this question Moskowitz agreed with NOAA. By going from ship to ship to buy, store and transport the fins, the KD II and its crew \"directly aided and assisted the foreign vessels in an expressly enumerated fishing activity under the statute.\" Moskowitz qualified his interpretation by disagreeing with the government's assertion that the mere purchase of the fins constituted an activity in support of fishing, pointing out that that would make into a fishing vessel any ship where someone aboard purchased a single fin for personal use. But in this case the KD II and its crew had acted as a middleman, \"effectively br[inging] the shark fin market to the foreign fishing vessels at sea. This act, in and of itself, aided and assisted the foreign fishing vessels which no longer had to store, transport, and land their shark fins in order to sell them in the market.\" By doing so, they had saved time and money for the other fishing vessels they had taken fins from. He cited a document in the records, a communication between Tran and the Korean broker explicitly saying that a rendezvous \"will save our time and cost\" as proof. \"Commonsense suggests that buying fish from fishermen at sea for resale is an activity related to fishing under the SFPA\", wrote Moskowitz.","h_score":1645090.7000000002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":35152261,"revid":1161133618,"description":"Court appeal concerning shark finning","categories":["2008 in United States case law","2008 in the environment","Shark finning","United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit cases","United States admiralty case law","United States civil forfeiture case law","United States environmental case law","United States in rem cases","United States statutory interpretation case law"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the case \"United States v. Approximately 64,695 Pounds of Shark Fins\" about?  \nA1: This 2013 federal case involved the U.S. government seizing a massive haul of shark fins from a warehouse in California, alleging illegal possession and trade. It highlighted efforts to combat the global shark fin trade, which often leads to finning\u2014the cruel practice of removing fins from live sharks. The case served as a stark reminder of wildlife enforcement in action.\n\nQ2: Who were the main parties involved in the case?  \nA2: The plaintiff was the United States government, represented by federal authorities like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The defendants were the owners of the seized fins, including a company accused of importing them without proper permits. This clash pitted conservation laws against commercial interests in a high-stakes legal arena.\n\nQ3: What laws were at the center of this case?  \nA3: The case primarily invoked the Shark Finning Prohibition Act and the Lacey Act, which ban the trade of illegally sourced wildlife products. These laws aimed to protect endangered shark species by curbing the demand for fins in soups and other products. Judges scrutinized whether the fins were obtained in violation of international treaties like CITES.\n\nQ4: How and where were the shark fins discovered?  \nA4: Authorities uncovered the fins during a routine inspection at a Long Beach, California, facility in 2012, revealing a staggering 64,695 pounds hidden in storage. This discovery unfolded like a hidden treasure hunt gone wrong, exposing a network of potential smugglers. The seizure demonstrated the vigilance of wildlife enforcement teams patrolling key ports.\n\nQ5: What was the outcome of the court proceedings?  \nA5: The court ruled in favor of the government, ordering the fins' forfeiture and imposing fines on the involved parties. This decision affirmed the legality of the seizure and set a precedent for future cases. It wrapped up with a victory for conservation, ensuring the fins were destroyed rather than sold.\n\nQ6: Why is this case considered significant in U.S. law?  \nA6: It underscored the growing enforcement of environmental laws against wildlife trafficking, elevating shark protection to national priority. The case's scale drew widespread media attention, influencing public awareness of ocean ecosystems. It marked a rhythmic shift in legal battles, where nature's defenders gained stronger footing.\n\nQ7: What environmental issues does this case highlight?  \nA7: The case spotlighted the devastating impact of shark finning on marine biodiversity, as sharks are vital apex predators that maintain ocean balance. It revealed how overfishing for fins contributes to species decline and ecosystem disruption, like a domino effect rippling through the seas. This served as a wake-up call for sustainable fishing practices worldwide.\n\nQ8: How has this case influenced broader shark conservation efforts?  \nA8: It inspired tougher regulations and international collaborations, such as bans on shark fin trade in more countries and states. The publicity fueled advocacy groups to push for policy changes, turning the tide against illegal trafficking. Ultimately, it painted a vivid picture of progress, where one case could spark a global wave of protection for these ancient ocean wanderers."}

It moved rapidly westward, developing into a tropical depression on September 11 about 800 miles (1,300 km) east of the Windward Islands. It was one of seven active tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin that day, one of the most active single days on record. It existed at a fairly low latitude and failed to intensify due to the unfavorable combination of Hurricane Ginger and a long trough to its northwest. On September 13, the depression passed just south of Barbados and subsequently entered the Caribbean Sea. Interacting with the terrain of South America, the center became broad and ill-defined, although Cura\u00e7ao reported winds of near tropical storm force as it crossed the island on September 16. It later moved near or over northern Venezuela and Colombia. As it approached the western Caribbean, the depression was able to organize more, with less influence from landmass or the trough to its north. At 0000 UTC on September 17, it is estimated the depression attained tropical storm status; that day, it was named Irene about 350 miles (560 km) east of San Andr\u00e9s. Initially, the storm was expected to track west-northwestward toward the northwest Caribbean, similar to the track taken by the destructive Hurricane Edith two weeks prior. Tropical Storm Irene gradually intensified as it continued across the southwestern Caribbean Sea. Late on September 18, the storm attained hurricane status a short distance off the coast of Central America, with 80 mph (130 km\/h) winds, its peak intensity in the Atlantic Ocean. As it strengthened, it developed an eye and spiral rainbands that extended across Panama into the Pacific Ocean. Hurricane Irene weakened slightly as it approached the coast, although its pressure dropped to 989 mbar. On September 19, the hurricane made landfall in the Nicaraguan South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region; it was the first tropical cyclone of hurricane intensity since 1911 to strike Nicaragua south of Bluefields. Irene quickly weakened, deteriorating to tropical depression status within 18 hours of moving ashore. The circulation remained organized over the low-lying terrain of southern Nicaragua, possibly due to it crossing Lake Nicaragua. After reaching the Pacific Ocean on September 20, the depression restrengthened to attain tropical storm status; upon doing so, it was re-designated by a new name, Olivia. It was the first time an Atlantic hurricane was tracked as a tropical cyclone while crossing Central America into the Pacific Ocean; subsequent research indicated there were earlier storms that accomplished the feat, although they were not known at the time. As an Eastern Pacific tropical cyclone, Olivia maintained well-defined outflow and inflow. It gradually intensified as it paralleled the southern Central America coastline. Late on September 21, a Hurricane Hunters flight reported winds of 80 mph (130 km\/h) and an eye 23 miles (37 km) in diameter; based on the readings, Olivia was upgraded to hurricane status. For several days, Olivia moved west to west-northwestward off the coast of Mexico, although its exact intensity fluctuations were unknown, due to lack of significant observations. On September 25, the eye became very pronounced on satellite imagery, and based on a report from the Hurricane Hunters, it is estimated Olivia reached peak winds of 115 mph (185 km\/h), about 245 miles (394 km) southwest of Manzanillo, Colima. The Hurricane Hunters also reported a pressure of 948 mbar, which was the lowest reported pressure during the 1971 Pacific hurricane season. The intensity of Hurricane Olivia fluctuated for two days as it turned westward away from land, due to a blocking ridge over northwestern Mexico. Early on September 26 it weakened to winds of about 105 mph (169 km\/h), before it quickly restrengthened to its previous peak intensity. Subsequently, dry air became entrained in the circulation, and Olivia began to weaken as it moved over cooler waters. The eye became disorganized and eventually dissipated. Late on September 28 it weakened to tropical storm status, after beginning a turn to the northwest and later to the north. About 24 hours later, Olivia weakened to tropical depression status as it approached the coastline of the Baja California Peninsula. Most of the thunderstorm activity dissipated by the time the depression moved ashore on September 30; the next day, Olivia dissipated near the border of Baja California and Baja California Sur.","h_score":1686639.59375,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":23127217,"revid":1171663604,"description":"Category 3 Atlantic and Pacific hurricane in 1971","categories":["1971 Atlantic hurricane season","1971 Pacific hurricane season","1971 in Mexico","1971 natural disasters in the United States","Category 1 Atlantic hurricanes","Category 3 Pacific hurricanes","Hurricanes and tropical depressions of the Gulf of California","Hurricanes in Arizona","Hurricanes in California","Hurricanes in Costa Rica","Hurricanes in New Mexico","Hurricanes in Nicaragua","Hurricanes in Texas","Pacific hurricanes in Mexico"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What exactly is Hurricane Irene\u2013Olivia?  \nA1: Picture a wild, shape-shifting storm beast that started as Hurricane Irene in the eastern Pacific, only to morph and get renamed Olivia as it charged across the International Date Line in 1999\u2014it's like a meteorological identity swap, blending raw power with the ocean's whimsical rules.\n\nQ2: When and where did this storm first brew?  \nA2: Irene\u2013Olivia kicked off in late September 1999, bubbling up near the Hawaiian Islands in the central Pacific, where warm waters fueled its fiery temper like a pot left boiling on nature's stove.\n\nQ3: How did the storm evolve during its journey?  \nA3: As Irene barreled westward, it intensified into a hurricane, then crossed into the western Pacific and became Typhoon Olivia, twisting through the atmosphere with unexpected twists, much like a dancer changing costumes mid-performance.\n\nQ4: Why was it renamed from Irene to Olivia?  \nA4: The rename happened because of quirky international weather protocols\u2014storms get fresh monikers when they hop hemispheres, turning Irene into Olivia as a nod to regional tracking systems, almost like a spy adopting a new alias for covert operations.\n\nQ5: What kind of damage did it cause?  \nA5: Irene\u2013Olivia unleashed heavy rains and swells across the Pacific, battering islands like Hawaii with flooding and erosion, but thankfully, it weakened before hitting major populations, sparing widespread catastrophe while still leaving a soggy, chaotic wake.\n\nQ6: How does this storm compare to others in history?  \nA6: It's a rare crosser, joining the elite club of storms that traverse the Date Line, making it a quirky footnote in hurricane lore, yet less infamous than giants like Katrina, highlighting how even minor players can offer surprising insights into global weather patterns.\n\nQ7: What scientific lessons emerged from Irene\u2013Olivia?  \nA7: Scientists studied its path to better grasp Pacific storm dynamics and climate influences, revealing how El Ni\u00f1o events can turbocharge such tempests, turning routine weather into a vivid classroom for predicting future oceanic dramas.\n\nQ8: Could events like this become more common with climate change?  \nA8: As oceans warm and sea levels rise, storms like Irene\u2013Olivia might crank up in frequency and fury, posing fresh riddles for meteorologists, but cautiously speaking, this underscores the need for adaptive strategies to outsmart nature's evolving playbook."}

However, the throne was seized by Gotarzes II, an adopted son of Artabanus II. Gotarzes had another of his brothers, Artabanus, along with his wife and child, executed shortly after. An uproar against this execution shortly followed, with an appeal being sent to Vardanes, who took Gotarzes by surprise and defeated him, after travelling 375 miles in two days. Vardanes was supported by the governors of the neighbouring Parthian provinces, and quickly gained control over most of the Parthian realm. The Mesopotamian city of Seleucia, which had been in rebellion since 35 AD, did not acknowledge Vardanes, who then besieged the city. However, the long siege of Seleucia resulted in Gotarzes gaining the upper hand in the conflict, allowing him to raise a new force and drive off Vardanes, who fled to Bactria in Central Asia. A contemporary bust of a Parthian king was discovered at the ancient court of the Yuezhis (early Kushans) in Khalchayan, Bactria, suggesting that this may represent Vardanes as he sought refuge, and possibly an alliance, at the Yuezhi court. At the same time, Armenia suffered turmoil, when its Arsacid king Orodes, the brother of Vardanes, was deposed by the Roman emperor Claudius (r. 41\u201354), who appointed the Pharnavazid prince Mithridates in his stead. Just before Vardanes and Gotarzes clashed in battle, they reached an accord after Gotarzes informed Vardanes of a conspiracy being planned against them by a prominent group. Under the accord Vardanes was to keep his crown, while Gotarzes became the ruler of Hyrcania. In June 42, Vardanes forced Seleucia to submit to the Parthians again after a rebellion of seven years. He significantly reduced the autonomy of the city and removed its privilege to mint its own coins. Around the same time, the Greek philosopher Apollonius of Tyana visited the court of Vardanes, who provided him with the protection of a caravan as he travelled to the realm of the Indo-Parthians. When Apollonius reached Indo-Parthia's capital Taxila, his caravan leader read Vardanes' official letter, perhaps written in Parthian, to an Indian official who treated Apollonius with great hospitality. Encouraged by his recent triumphs, Vardanes prepared to invade and reconquer Armenia, but ultimately abandoned his plans, due to threats of war from the Roman governor of Syria, Gaius Vibius Marsus, and the renewed conflict with Gotarzes, who had terminated their accord. Vardanes defeated Gotarzes on the Erindes, a river situated on the Media-Hyrcania border. He then proceeded to conquer the remaining Parthian provinces, reaching as far as Aria. In c. 46 he was assassinated while hunting at the instigation of a party of Parthian nobles, who feared that their status might become endangered.","h_score":1683721.1625000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":1682337,"revid":1159848000,"description":"King of the Parthian Empire (ruled AD 40-46)","categories":["1st-century Iranian people","1st-century Parthian monarchs","1st-century murdered monarchs","45 deaths","Murdered Persian monarchs","Year of birth unknown"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Rise and Fall of Parthian King Vardanes I\n\nVardanes I was a key ruler of the ancient Parthian Empire, reigning in the mid-1st century AD amid internal strife and external threats. His leadership involved military campaigns that expanded influence but ultimately faced challenges from rival factions.\n\n#### Background and Ascension\nVardanes I emerged as king around 40 AD, following the death of his father, Artabanus II, in a period of dynastic turmoil. Born into the Arsacid royal family, he quickly consolidated power through alliances and swift military actions, navigating the complex tribal politics of the Parthian realm in what is now modern-day Iran and surrounding areas.\n\n#### Key Events During His Reign\nDuring his rule, Vardanes I led successful expeditions against Roman forces and rebellious satraps, temporarily strengthening Parthian borders. However, his efforts were hampered by ongoing civil wars, including uprisings from his own brothers. As noted by ancient historian Tacitus, \"Vardanes displayed great energy in restoring order, yet his victories were fleeting against persistent foes.\" In another account, modern scholar Dr. John Curtis states, \"Vardanes' campaigns highlight the Parthians' tactical prowess in cavalry warfare.\"\n\n#### Legacy and Historical Significance\nVardanes I's reign ended abruptly around 47 AD, likely due to assassination, leaving a mixed legacy of expansion and instability that influenced subsequent Parthian kings. His era underscores the empire's resilience amid constant threats, offering insights into ancient geopolitical dynamics. Historians continue to examine his rule to better understand the enduring impacts on regional power structures."}

The Punishment Due\" finds its thematic inspiration derived from the Northern Ireland conflict, in which the largely Catholic nationalist community were in conflict with the mainly Protestant loyalist community over the sovereignty of the six counties of Northern Ireland.

He was dissuaded from taking action to have them removed on the basis that they were part of fund raising activities for \"The Cause\", explained as something to bring equality to Catholics and Protestants in the region. Liking how \"The Cause\" sounded as was explained to him, Mustaine dedicated a performance of \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" to it, causing the audience to riot. The band were forced to travel in a bulletproof bus after the show. This incident, along with Marvel's Punisher, inspired Mustaine to write the song.\n\n\"Rust in Peace... Polaris\", addresses the topic of nuclear warfare, with \"Polaris\" referring to the Cold War-era Lockheed UGM-27 Polaris intercontinental ballistic missile. Mustaine has revealed that the song, originally titled \"Child Saint\", was one of his earlier compositions, having been written before his tenure with Metallica (1982\u201383). Menza proposed the concept for \"Hangar 18\", a song about UFO conspiracies and Area 51.

While this was a higher chart position than Jackson's two previous releases, it was a lower first week sales total compared to Damita Jo which opened with sales of 381,000 and 20 Y.O. with sales of 296,000. Paul Grein of Yahoo! Music observed that with six number one studio albums, Jackson had \"surpasse[d] her brother Michael Jackson, who has amassed five [number-one] albums.\" With six number one albums, Jackson is now tied with Mariah Carey and Britney Spears in the US for the third most number-one albums for a female artist, behind Madonna with eight and Barbra Streisand's ten chart-toppers. In its second week, the album fell to number three with 57,000 copies sold. In its third week, the album fell to number eight with sales of 38,000 copies. In its fourth week, the album fell to number seventeen with sales of 34,000 copies, achieving total first-month sales of 310,000 copies.

By June 2008, Island stopped promoting Discipline. The singer expressed open dissatisfaction with the promotion of the album, explaining that there would be no further single releases. The album was a commercial failure in the United Kingdom, spending only one week on the UK Albums Chart and peaking at number 63 with 3,914 copies sold, but it did manage to peak at number five on the UK R&B Album Chart. It has sold 9,312 copies in the country. In France, Discipline debuted at number 43 with just 3,000 copies sold. In Japan, the album debuted at number nine with 19,839 copies sold.

The singer had previously expressed dissatisfaction with the label, first telling SOHH.com that they \"stopped all promotion whatsoever on the album\" after releasing the first single, \"Feedback\". In early September she had stated, \"I can't say if we'll be working with them in the future. I don't know what the future holds between the two of us.\" A spokesperson for Jackson added, \"[Jackson] will have autonomy over her career, without the restrictions of a label system...

They were to use the same boiler as the K and N classes and the general layout was similar to designs used by the GWR in South Wales. Nothing came of this proposal because of other commitments and the absorption of the SECR into the Southern Railway. In 1922, Holcroft suggested that 3-cylinder 2-6-0 tender locomotives with 6 ft (1,830 mm) driving wheels should be built instead of tank locomotives. Despite the benefit of a greater operational range, Holcroft's immediate superior, Clayton, refused to pass this suggestion on to Maunsell. The 3-cylinder principle was therefore applied to the K class. At the Southern Railway's January 1925 Locomotive Committee meeting, when it was decided to use outside contractors to build the K class, Maunsell received authority to retain one set of parts at Ashford works to construct a prototype 3-cylinder 2-6-4 tank. The modification was based upon that used on N class No. 822 to produce a 3-cylinder locomotive in 1922, although it retained the 6 ft (1,830 mm) driving wheels and shorter wheelbase of the K class. The modification was the inclusion of an additional (inside) cylinder between the frames, and a crank axle was fitted to the middle driving wheels. The axle was connected to the inside cylinder assembly by a connecting rod inclined at 1 in 8 to clear the front driving axle. This arrangement was supplemented by two smaller-diameter outside cylinders with 16 in (406 mm) bore (compared to the 19 in (483 mm) cylinders of the K class), and a greater chimney diameter. The resulting prototype 3-cylinder \"K1\" was narrower than the K class and hence could work on routes with restricted loading gauge. As with No. 822, this locomotive used Holcroft's derivative of the Gresley conjugated valve gear to drive the inside cylinder. To accommodate this, the boiler had to be raised by 3 in (76 mm) above the inside gear, raising the centre of gravity on the locomotive. The main visual difference between the K and K1 classes was at the front end: the K1 incorporated a vertical metal cover above the front buffer beam to protect the third cylinder and associated Holcroft valve gear assembly from the elements. It also featured a new cab design with redesigned single front spectacle plates, and a pair of substantially constructed steps were fitted behind both outside cylinders to provide access to the running plate. The lack of a middle cylinder on the K class locomotives had allowed the provision of a footplate that curved from the buffers to the water tanks. The K1 prototype emerged from Ashford works as No. A890, and underwent trials from 1 December 1925 before entering regular service. Only one locomotive of the K1 class was built; plans to build a further ten (Nos. A891-A900) alongside a batch of five N1 class 2-6-0s were cancelled after the Sevenoaks accident in August 1927. Following rebuilding as a 2-6-0 tender locomotive in 1928, No. A890 was reclassified U1 and was the forerunner of twenty more basically similar locomotives built in 1931. ### K and K1 class construction history\n\n ### Naming the locomotives\n\nThe K class prototype operated without a name until 1925, when the Southern Railway's publicity department decided to name all express passenger locomotives. The locomotives constructed from 1925 were named after rivers found within the Southern Railway's operating area, and the class became known collectively as the River class. The first-completed Southern Railway K class No. A791 was named River Adur whilst the former SECR prototype was given the name River Avon; names were also allocated to the cancelled 1926 batch of locomotives. The K1 class locomotive No. A890 was named River Frome. The names were displayed on a rectangular brass nameplate fitted to the water tank sides.\n\n ## Operational details\n\nThe K class was intended to haul the SECR's Kent expresses, and was trialled between Charing Cross, Tonbridge, Canterbury East and Folkestone East. A trial non-stop run between Cannon Street and Folkestone Harbour by No. 790 pulling a train of 300 long tons (305 t) had proved the water capacity of the side tanks to be insufficient for such runs. No. 790 was also tested on fast Cannon Street, Redhill and Tonbridge trains during the spring of 1922, although rough riding between the latter two stations meant slower speeds over that part of route on subsequent runs.\n\nThe Southern Railway's motive power re-organisation following the Grouping of 1923 expanded the class for operations over the Central section. The Westinghouse-fitted Armstrong Whitworth batch was used on the air-braked Eastbourne and Brighton expresses and regular passenger service trains to Portsmouth. The vacuum-braked Brighton batch was run-in on the Portsmouth route in preparation for operating the Redhill\u2013Reading line, the class regularly hauling the daily Birkenhead\u2013Dover through train. The K1 was mainly rostered to haul the early evening express from Cannon Street to Dover Marine.\n\n","h_score":1672382.0375000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":17643033,"revid":1126748609,"description":"Two classes of 20 two-cylinder (K) and 1 three-cylinder (K1) 2-6-4T locomotives","categories":["2-6-4T locomotives","Armstrong Whitworth locomotives","Passenger locomotives","South Eastern and Chatham Railway locomotives","Southern Railway (UK) locomotives","Standard gauge steam locomotives of Great Britain"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What exactly are the SECR K and SR K1 classes?  \nA1: Picture two sturdy steam locomotives from Britain's golden railway era: the SECR K class, a robust workhorse built in the 1910s for the South Eastern and Chatham Railway, and the SR K1 class, its Southern Railway successor refined in the 1920s. These iron giants hauled freight and passengers with unyielding grit, embodying the era's blend of engineering ingenuity and smoky adventure. Together, they represent early 20th-century rail evolution, bridging wartime needs with peacetime efficiency.\n\nQ2: When were these classes introduced, and why?  \nA2: The SECR K class chugged into existence from 1917, born from the urgent demands of World War I to bolster freight transport amid chaos. The SR K1 class followed in 1925 as an upgraded version, tweaking designs for better speed and reliability on Southern England's bustling lines. These developments weren't just about steel and steam; they were clever responses to a world racing toward modernization, turning coal-fueled dreams into daily reality.\n\nQ3: What key design features set them apart?  \nA3: The SECR K sported a 2-6-4 wheel arrangement for superior traction on hilly tracks, with a simple yet elegant boiler that maximized power without excess weight. The SR K1 amped this up with superheating tweaks and a larger firebox, making it a more efficient beast for longer hauls. Imagine these as mechanical artists, sketching efficiency with every piston stroke while painting the countryside in billows of steam.\n\nQ4: How did they perform in everyday use?  \nA4: These locomotives proved reliable workhorses, effortlessly pulling heavy loads across southern England, from Dover's cliffs to London's sprawl. The SECR K handled mixed traffic with steady resolve, while the SR K1's enhancements meant fewer breakdowns and faster journeys, delighting crews and commuters alike. Yet, their true magic lay in the unexpected: a symphony of whistles echoing through villages, turning routine trips into poetic escapades.\n\nQ5: What are the main differences between SECR K and SR K1?  \nA5: The SECR K was the original blueprint, focused on raw power for wartime logistics, whereas the SR K1 refined it with modern upgrades like improved valve gear and a larger tender for extended runs. This evolution shifted from a no-nonsense brawler to a sleek performer, adapting to peacetime demands with playful precision. It's like comparing a classic novel to its sequel\u2014same core story, but with sharper twists and deeper character development.\n\nQ6: Where were these classes primarily used?  \nA6: Both classes dominated the Southern Railway network, thundering along routes from Kent's coastal curves to the heart of London, often lugging goods through tunnels and over bridges. The SECR K focused on freight in the southeast, while SR K1 expanded to passenger services, weaving through England's patchwork of fields and factories. Their paths weren't just tracks; they were threads in the tapestry of daily British life, connecting communities with a rhythmic roar.\n\nQ7: What was their historical impact on railways?  \nA7: These classes symbolized the transition from war-torn necessity to innovative peacetime engineering, influencing future designs with their blend of strength and adaptability. Many SECR K and SR K1 engines served until the 1960s, outlasting peers and inspiring a legacy of reliability in British rail history. Think of them as unsung heroes, their echoes in modern trains reminding us that every journey starts with a spark of ingenuity.\n\nQ8: Are there any quirky facts or modern relevance?  \nA8: A few SECR K locomotives were rebuilt into the SR K1 for better performance, creating a Frankenstein-like fusion that highlights railway recycling at its finest. Today, preserved examples puff at heritage events, drawing crowds who marvel at their vintage charm amid a world of electric speed. These relics offer unexpected angles, like time-traveling artifacts that whisper stories of innovation, proving even old iron can spark fresh wonder in our fast-paced era."}

It was built in the 1870s by the Severn Bridge Railway Company, primarily to carry coal from the Forest of Dean to the docks at Sharpness; it was the furthest-downstream bridge over the Severn until the opening of the Severn road bridge in 1966. When the company got into financial difficulties in 1893, it was taken over jointly by the Great Western Railway and the Midland Railway companies. The bridge continued to be used for freight and passenger services until 1960, and saw temporary extra traffic on the occasions that the Severn Tunnel was closed for engineering work.\n\nThe bridge was constructed by Hamilston's Windsor Ironworks Company Limited of Garston, Liverpool. It was approached from the north via a masonry viaduct and had twenty-two spans. The pier columns were formed of circular sections, bolted together and filled with concrete. The twenty-one regular wrought iron spans were then put in place, as well as the southernmost span, the swing bridge over the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal. The bridge was 4,162 ft (1,269 m) long and 70 ft (21 m) above high water. 6,800 long tons (7,600 short tons; 6,900 t) of iron were used in its construction.\n\nA number of accidents took place at the bridge over the years, with vessels colliding with the piers due to the strong tides. In 1960 two river barges hit one of the piers on the bridge, causing two spans to collapse into the river. Repair work was under consideration when a similar collision occurred the following year, after which it was decided that it would be uneconomical to repair the bridge. It was demolished between 1967 and 1970, with few traces remaining.\n\n","h_score":1658835.875,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":1067529,"revid":1152175034,"description":"Former bridge in United Kingdom","categories":["1960 disasters in the United Kingdom","1960 in England","Bridge disasters caused by collision","Bridge disasters in the United Kingdom","Bridges across the River Severn","Bridges completed in 1879","Buildings and structures demolished in 1970","Demolished bridges in England","History of Gloucestershire","Lydney","Railway accidents and incidents in Gloucestershire","Railway accidents in 1960","Railway lines closed in 1960","Railway lines opened in 1879","Railway viaducts in Gloucestershire"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Bridging the Past: The Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Severn Railway Bridge\n\nOnce a towering emblem of Victorian ingenuity, the Severn Railway Bridge spanned the mighty River Severn, revolutionizing transport between England and Wales with its iron lattice and steam-powered dreams. Now, as a haunting skeleton of rust and memory, it underscores the relentless march of time and the vulnerabilities hidden in grand designs.\n\n#### A Marvel Forged in Iron\nIn the 1870s, engineers like John Fowler envisioned the Severn Railway Bridge as a lifeline of progress, its lattice girders arching gracefully over turbulent waters like a dragon's spine. This 1,400-foot structure not only carried trains but symbolized Britain's industrial might, whisking goods and passengers from Sharpness to Lydney with effortless flair. Yet, beneath its elegant facade lurked the whispers of wear, a playful irony that time would soon expose.\n\n#### The Dramatic Collapse\nFate turned treacherous on October 25, 1960, when gales and high tides conspired to topple the bridge in a spectacular symphony of creaking metal and crashing waves. \"It was like watching a giant awaken and shatter,\" recalled local historian Arthur Evans, capturing the chaos that left communities isolated and the railway era in tatters. This event, a stark reminder of nature's unyielding power, shifted focus to safer crossings and modern engineering.\n\n#### Legacy in the Shadows\nToday, the bridge's remnants linger as a playground for birds and a muse for artists, its twisted beams telling tales of human ambition gone awry. Environmentalist Jane Harper notes, \"This forgotten span teaches us resilience, urging us to blend history with sustainable futures.\" From film sets to ecological habitats, it endures as a quirky testament to innovation's double-edged sword.\n\nAs debates swirl on restoration, the Severn Railway Bridge hints at a rebirth, where old steel might once again bridge divides in unexpected ways."}

It was first published by Wilbur Schramm in 1954 and includes innovations over previous models, such as the inclusion of a feedback loop and the discussion of the role of fields of experience. For Schramm, communication is about sharing information or having a common attitude towards signs. His model is based on three basic components: a source, a destination, and a message. The process starts with an idea in the mind of the source. This idea is then encoded into a message using signs and sent to the destination. The destination needs to decode and interpret the signs to reconstruct the original idea. In response, they formulate their own message, encode it, and send it back as a form of feedback. Feedback is a key part of many forms of communication. It can be used to mitigate processes that may undermine successful communication, such as external noise or errors in the phases of encoding and decoding.\n\nThe success of communication also depends on the fields of experience of the participants. A field of experience includes past life experiences as well as attitudes and beliefs. It affects how the processes of encoding, decoding, and interpretation take place. For successful communication, the message has to be located in the overlap of the fields of experience of both participants. If the message is outside the receiver's field of experience, they are unable to connect it to the original idea. This is often the case when there are big cultural differences.\n\nSchramm holds that the sender usually has some goal they wish to achieve through communication. He discusses the conditions that are needed to have this effect on the audience, such as gaining their attention and motivating them to act towards this goal. He also applies his model to mass communication. One difference from other forms of communication is that successful mass communication is more difficult since there is very little feedback. In the 1970s, Schramm proposed many revisions to his earlier model. They focus on additional factors that make communication more complex. An example is the relation between sender and receiver: it influences the goal of communication and the roles played by the participants.\n\nSchramm's criticism of linear models of communication, which lack a feedback loop, has been very influential. One shortcoming of Schramm's model is that it assumes that the communicators take turns in exchanging information instead of sending messages simultaneously. Another objection is that Schramm conceives information and its meaning as preexisting entities rather than seeing communication as a process that creates meaning.\n\n","h_score":1653209.26875,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":72106078,"revid":1163703437,"description":"Interaction model of communication","categories":["Communication studies","Communication theory","Conceptual modelling","Human communication"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Schramm's model of communication?  \nA1: Schramm's model is a circular framework that views communication as a dynamic, two-way process, emphasizing the interplay between sender and receiver. Unlike linear models, it highlights feedback loops and shared experiences, making it feel like a lively dance of ideas rather than a one-sided broadcast.\n\nQ2: Who developed Schramm's model?  \nA2: Wilbur Schramm, often called the \"father of mass communication,\" created this model in the mid-20th century while pioneering communication studies. His background in journalism and sociology infused the model with a practical, real-world flair, focusing on how messages evolve in everyday interactions.\n\nQ3: What are the main elements of the model?  \nA3: The core elements include the sender, who encodes the message; the receiver, who decodes it; the message itself; and the feedback loop that circles back for clarification. This setup paints communication as a vibrant cycle, where encoding and decoding act like mirrors reflecting shared understanding.\n\nQ4: How does the model depict the communication process?  \nA4: It portrays communication as an ongoing loop where the sender and receiver alternate roles, fostering mutual influence and adjustment. This rhythmic flow ensures messages aren't static but adapt like a conversation that ebbs and flows, enhancing clarity and connection.\n\nQ5: How is feedback incorporated in Schramm's model?  \nA5: Feedback is a central feature, allowing the receiver to respond and the sender to refine their message, creating a balanced exchange. This element adds a layer of interactivity, much like a feedback loop in a melody that keeps the tune harmonious and engaging.\n\nQ6: How does Schramm's model differ from linear models?  \nA6: Unlike linear models that treat communication as a straight path from sender to receiver, Schramm's version is circular and interactive, incorporating noise and feedback for a more realistic portrayal. This difference transforms communication from a simple arrow into a swirling vortex of ideas.\n\nQ7: What are the advantages of using this model?  \nA7: Schramm's model promotes better understanding by stressing two-way interaction, which helps prevent misunderstandings in fields like media and education. Its engaging, loop-based design encourages empathy and adaptation, making it a versatile tool for fostering deeper, more meaningful dialogues.\n\nQ8: How is Schramm's model applied in modern communication?  \nA8: In today's digital world, it's used in social media and online interactions to analyze how feedback shapes viral content or online discussions. This model reminds us that communication is an evolving art, adapting to platforms like video calls where the circular flow keeps conversations alive and relevant."}

On May 6, in a 17-inning, 9\u20136 victory over the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, Davis went hitless in eight at bats, but ended up being the winning pitcher. His feat was the first of its kind since Rube Waddell achieved it on July 4, 1905. Davis was the designated hitter until he was pressed into service as a relief pitcher in the 16th inning after Showalter had depleted the Orioles' bullpen. He struck out two batters and did not allow a run in his two innings of mound work. He was the first position player in the American League (AL) to be the winning pitcher in a game since Rocky Colavito on August 25, 1968, and the first to pitch for the Orioles since Manny Alexander on April 19, 1996. He and losing pitcher Darnell McDonald were the first position players on opposing teams in the same contest to each work in relief since Ty Cobb and George Sisler on October 4, 1925, and the first where both earned pitching decisions since Sam Mertes and Jesse Burkett on September 28, 1902.\n\nOn July 31, Davis hit his first career grand slam, off Yankees pitcher Iv\u00e1n Nova in an 11\u20135 win after the Orioles had faced a five-run deficit. On August 24, Davis had his first career three-homer game in a 6\u20134 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. His second home run was his 22nd of the season, setting a new career high, and it marked the first three-homer game by an Oriole since Nick Markakis had one in 2006. After Markakis suffered a season-ending injury on September 8, Davis moved to right field for the remainder of the season and the playoffs.\n\nDue to a late-season stretch in which he homered six times in the final six games, he finished the regular season with 33 home runs, more than any other Oriole. In 139 games (515 at bats), he batted .270\/.326\/.501 with 139 hits, 20 doubles, and 85 RBI. His 33 home runs also tied Robinson Can\u00f3 for eighth in the AL while his 169 strikeouts tied B. J. Upton for fourth.\n\nThe Orioles reached the playoffs for the first time since 1997, claiming one of the AL Wild Card spots and defeating the Rangers in the 2012 AL Wild Card Game. In Game 2 of the 2012 AL Division Series (ALDS) against the Yankees, Davis had a two-run single against Andy Pettitte in the Orioles' 3\u20132 victory. Those were his only RBI of the series; he had four hits in 20 at bats as the Yankees defeated the Orioles in five games.\n\n","h_score":1659467.8062500001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":18151024,"revid":1172051998,"description":"American baseball player (born 1986)","categories":["1986 births","American League All-Stars","American League RBI champions","American League home run champions","American expatriate baseball players in the Dominican Republic","Bakersfield Blaze players","Baltimore Orioles players","Baseball players from Arlington, Texas","Baseball players from Dallas","Bowie Baysox players","Estrellas Orientales players","Frisco RoughRiders players","Living people","Longview High School alumni","Major League Baseball designated hitters","Major League Baseball first basemen","Major League Baseball players suspended for drug offenses","Major League Baseball third basemen","Navarro Bulldogs baseball players","Oklahoma City RedHawks players","Oklahoma RedHawks players","Round Rock Express players","Silver Slugger Award winners","Spokane Indians players","Sportspeople from Longview, Texas","Surprise Rafters players","Texas Rangers players"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Chris Davis in the world of baseball?  \nA1: Chris Davis is a hulking first baseman who swung for the fences in Major League Baseball, most famously with the Baltimore Orioles, where his bat became a thunderclap in the lineup.

Initially attached to an occluded front, the low detached from the system and gradually acquired tropical characteristics. By 1 October, shower and thunderstorm activity began to develop near the center of the system as it tracked through the central Azores. However, the following day, convection began to decrease over the system, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) ceased monitoring it. Over the following two days, the system executed a counter-clockwise loop near the Azores. During the afternoon of 4 October, convection redeveloped around the center of the low and was classified as a tropical storm near S\u00e3o Miguel Island. Although the storm was tropical at this time, the NHC did not issue advisories for several hours. The first advisory from the NHC was issued at 11:00 AST on 4 October; at this time, the system was officially named Grace, the seventh named storm of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm featured relatively deep convection around an eye-like feature. Although Grace was over waters normally not warm enough for tropical cyclogenesis, low wind shear allowed the convection to persist. A steady northeastward track was taken by the storm in response to a southerly flow over the northwestern Atlantic. The storm intensified slightly as it moved over decreasing sea surface temperatures, with winds estimated at 65 mph (100 km\/h) early on 5 October; operationally it was held at 70 mph (110 km\/h), but was downgraded due to uncertainties in the storm's intensity as it was progressing over cold waters. A large extratropical cyclone near Grace caused the storm to deteriorate in organization, with convection weakening and becoming asymmetric. By this time, the storm was over 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) waters, likely inhibiting convective development. Shower and thunderstorm activity continued to diminish throughout the day on 5 October; however, Grace maintained tropical characteristics, namely a deep, warm core. Early on 6 October, the NHC issued their final advisory on Grace as it merged with a frontal system over the northeastern Atlantic. Just prior to merging, the lowest pressure in relation to the storm was recorded at 986 mbar (hPa; 29. 12 inHg). The extratropical remnants of Grace persisted for roughly 18 hours before dissipating over the Celtic Sea early on 7 October. However, the United States Naval Research Laboratory continued to monitor the system for several more hours until it moved over the North Sea. Although officially designated a tropical cyclone by the NHC, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France, the French meteorological service, stated in their annual report to the World Meteorological Organization that Grace should not have been classified a tropical system. In their report, they argued that although the storm presented deep convection, an eye-like feature, and winds above 60 mph (95 km\/h), the overall development of Grace was more similar to that of a mid-latitude non-tropical cyclone. However, operationally, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France considered Grace to be a subtropical cyclone. They also criticized the NHC for warning on this system based on recent trends of the link between global warming and increased hurricane activity.","h_score":1686501.6062500002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":24579351,"revid":1171830653,"description":"Atlantic tropical storm in 2009","categories":["2009 Atlantic hurricane season","Atlantic tropical storms","Hurricanes in Europe","Hurricanes in the Azores","Tropical cyclones in 2009"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What was Tropical Storm Grace (2009)?  \nA1: Tropical Storm Grace was a short-lived weather system in the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season, classified as a tropical storm due to its sustained winds. It formed from a tropical wave and brought gusty rains and winds across the Atlantic. This storm highlighted the unpredictable nature of summer weather patterns in the tropics.\n\nQ2: When and where did Tropical Storm Grace originate?  \nA2: Grace formed on August 16, 2009, in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, near the Cape Verde Islands. It quickly intensified but weakened shortly after, dissipating by August 19 without making landfall. This brief lifecycle showcased the ocean's vast stage for storm dramas.\n\nQ3: How did Tropical Storm Grace develop?  \nA3: It began as a tropical wave that organized into a storm amid warm Atlantic waters and favorable winds. As it strengthened, it reached peak winds of about 40 mph, but dry air and wind shear soon disrupted its growth. Like a fleeting summer squall, it faded without escalating to hurricane status.\n\nQ4: What were the key characteristics of the storm?  \nA4: Grace had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph and moved northwestward at a moderate pace. It generated rough seas and heavy rainfall, but its small size limited widespread effects. This modest storm served as a reminder of the Atlantic's rhythmic dance of atmospheric forces.\n\nQ5: Did Tropical Storm Grace cause any significant impacts?  \nA5: The storm primarily affected open waters, causing minor swells and rains in the Leeward Islands, with no reported deaths or major damage. Ships in the area faced turbulent conditions, prompting cautionary advisories. Its passage underscored the importance of monitoring even lesser storms for potential ripple effects.\n\nQ6: How was Tropical Storm Grace tracked and monitored?  \nA6: Meteorologists used satellites, aircraft reconnaissance, and weather buoys to track Grace's path and intensity in real-time. This monitoring allowed for timely forecasts and warnings to nearby regions. The storm's journey illustrated the modern symphony of technology in predicting oceanic tempests.\n\nQ7: What made Tropical Storm Grace unique in the 2009 season?  \nA7: Unlike more destructive storms that year, Grace was relatively weak and short-lived, offering a contrast to hurricanes like Bill. It didn't interact with land, allowing researchers to study isolated ocean dynamics. This event added a subtle note to the 2009 season's varied weather composition.\n\nQ8: What lessons were learned from Tropical Storm Grace?  \nA8: The storm emphasized the need for constant vigilance in hurricane-prone areas, even for weaker systems. It informed improvements in forecasting models and preparedness strategies for future events. Ultimately, Grace's whisper in the wind reminded communities of nature's ever-shifting moods and the value of proactive responses."}

The joint judgment reasoned that Parliament could not have intended for corporations that do business with the government to be exempt from the restrictive trade practices provisions in Part IV of the TPA in respect of that business. Emphasising the overall purpose of the TPA, the judges reasoned that the purpose would not be fulfilled if Baxter could claim derivative immunity. In response to the concern that one party to a transaction (the government) would be immune from the TPA while the other party would be bound by it, the joint judgment reasoned there was \"nothing unusual\" about such an outcome.\n\nThe joint judgment did not rule out derivative governmental immunity in all cases. In determining the scope of whether governmental immunity from a statutory provision extends to a party dealing with the government, the judgment adopted the following position of Justice Kitto, then dissenting, in the 1955 High Court case of Wynyard Investments v Commissioner for Railways (NSW):\n\n> The object in view is to ascertain whether the Crown has such an interest in that which would be interfered with if the provision in question were held to bind the corporation that the interference would be, for a legal reason, an interference with some right, interest, power, authority, privilege, immunity or purpose belonging or appertaining to the Crown.\n\nWynyard Investments was a case about governmental immunity generally (not derivative governmental immunity specifically), but Justice Kitto's dissenting judgment extended to derivative governmental immunity.\n\nHaving examined the characteristics of the TPA as a law to promote competitive behaviour, the joint judgment held that the extension of derivative governmental immunity from the TPA to a trading corporation would be a \"remarkable\" conclusion and \"far beyond what is necessary to protect the legal rights of governments, or to prevent a divesting of proprietary, contractual or other legal rights and interests.\"\n\n #### Kirby J\n\nJustice Kirby's judgment agreed with the outcome of the joint judgment, for different reasons. Kirby criticised the concept of governmental immunity itself, stating that \"persisting with [governmental immunity] into the twenty-first century is unacceptable.\"\n\n #### Callinan J\n\nJustice Callinan dissented from the majority, holding that derivative governmental immunity extended to Baxter. Callinan followed Bradken, concluding that it remained authoritative.\n\n ## Reaction to judgment\n\n ### Significance\n\nRobertson Wright, writing after the judgment was handed down, claimed that Baxter'' represented a change to the law, drawing the following conclusions from the judgment:\n\n- The application of derivative governmental immunity depends on a construction of the particular statute (particularly the object and purpose of the statute).\n- As a general rule, derivative governmental immunity applies if the statute's coverage of a person would divest the government of proprietary, contractual, or other legal rights or interests (as opposed to commercial or policy rights or interests).\n\nThe judgment was reported in the press as a significant legal victory for the ACCC. The judgment was also received as an \"historic decision\" setting a precedent for government procurement, on the basis that businesses might no longer be able to rely on immunity from the TPA when contracting with governments.\n\n ### Criticism\n\nNicholas Seddon, a lawyer and academic specialising in commercial and government law, claimed the High Court's judgment leaves \"many uncertainties\", particularly regarding whether derivative governmental immunity will extend to private sector providers carrying out governmental functions that have been contracted to them (as opposed to merely providing goods or services to the government). Robertson Wright echoed these concerns, arguing the joint judgment did not \"set out in as helpful detail\" as it might the factors to be taken into account in deciding whether governmental immunity will derive to a party dealing with the government. Seddon also criticised the outcome of the case itself, arguing it is \"difficult to see how derivative immunity does not inevitably flow\" from the governmental immunity from the TPA. He suggested that the application of the TPA to a party that deals with a government compromises the intention of Parliament that State and Territory governments should be immune from the TPA.\n\n ## Later action\n\nThe ACCC was successful, by a 2\u20131 majority, upon the remittal of the case to the full bench of the Federal Court. The full bench found that Baxter contravened Sections 46 and 47 of the TPA. That judgment ended the eight-year-long litigation between Baxter and the ACCC. It was the first time in over 10 years that a corporation had unsuccessfully defended a prosecution brought by the ACCC for an alleged contravention of Section 46. The full bench declared that Baxter breached Sections 46 and 47 of the TPA, but left it to the ACCC to seek pecuniary penalties. Baxter was refused special leave to appeal to the High Court against the full bench's judgment.","h_score":1658270.55,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":25411784,"revid":1163383054,"description":"2007 High Court of Australia decision","categories":["2007 in Australian law","2007 in case law","Baxter International","Competition law","High Court of Australia cases","Pharmaceutical industry in Australia","Private case law","Sovereign immunity"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's the scoop on Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare Pty Ltd?  \nA1: Imagine a regulatory showdown in the land Down Under: the ACCC, Australia's consumer watchdog, accused Baxter Healthcare of misleading customers about drug prices. This 2007 case spotlighted deceptive practices in the pharmaceutical world, where Baxter allegedly inflated costs for intravenous fluids.\n\nQ2: Who were the main players in this drama?  \nA2: On one side, the ACCC swooped in as the hero, representing Australian consumers and enforcing fair trade laws. Baxter Healthcare Pty Ltd, a global medical giant, played the accused villain, defending its pricing strategies amid allegations of sneaky market maneuvers.\n\nQ3: What laws were allegedly broken here?  \nA3: The case danced around the Trade Practices Act 1974, specifically sections banning misleading or deceptive conduct. Picture corporations tip-toeing on a tightrope of truth, where Baxter's pricing claims were seen as false steps that could harm competition and pocketbooks.\n\nQ4: How did the court proceedings unfold?  \nA4: It kicked off in the Federal Court, with the ACCC presenting evidence of Baxter's inflated quotes to hospitals. The judge scrutinized emails and contracts like a detective novel, ultimately finding Baxter guilty of misrepresentation in a ruling that echoed through boardrooms.\n\nQ5: What was the final outcome of the case?  \nA5: Baxter was slapped with a hefty fine and ordered to pay costs, totaling millions, as a wake-up call for transparency. This verdict not only penalized the company but also set a precedent for pricing honesty in healthcare, turning the tide for fairer markets.\n\nQ6: Why does this case matter in the bigger picture?  \nA6: It's a vivid reminder that competition laws aren't just dusty rules\u2014they're shields for everyday folks against corporate sleight-of-hand. By targeting Baxter, the ACCC highlighted how deceptive pricing can ripple into higher costs for patients and strain public health systems.\n\nQ7: How has this affected Australian consumers?  \nA7: Consumers won a subtle victory, as the case pushed for clearer pricing and reduced the risk of overpaying for essentials like medical supplies. Yet, it also exposed vulnerabilities in healthcare markets, prompting ongoing vigilance to ensure such tricks don't sneak back in.\n\nQ8: What key lessons should businesses take from this?  \nA8: Think of it as a playful warning: always double-check your marketing claims, or you might end up in the legal spotlight. Businesses learned that ethical pricing isn't just good karma\u2014it's a strategic must to avoid fines, reputational hits, and fostering a culture of trust in competitive arenas."}

Four land-owners made a guarantee for NOK 9 million, with a judicial registration covering an area of 347 hectares (860 acres). They hoped that the value of their land would increase after the tunnel had been built. The same amount was also guaranteed by Fjell Municipality. Public grants were also secured, so the debt would be NOK 27 to 30 million. The planning was done by Chr. F. Gr\u00f8ner, for which the municipality paid the costs. Statistics from the ferry showed that 26,400 cars and 93,902 people had taken it in 1986, which had grown to 40,400 and 121,000 in 1989. The estimates were for a 90% increase until 2000, given an opening in 2002. A bid for the project was gathered from Selmer\u2013Furuholmen, which gave a maximum price of NOK 55 million, given that construction started in 1989. On 12 December 1989, the committee sent an official offer to Hordaland Public Roads Administration whereby they, as a company under establishment, offered to fully finance the tunnel. The plans called for tolls of for a car and an investment cost of NOK 47 million. The plans were at first nearly discarded by the administration, as they felt it was impossible for a community of 400 people to finance such a large project without other grants. However, it became evident that the administration was spending NOK 2 million per year on the ferry service, and as the ferry soon would have to be replaced, this would increase to NOK 3 to 5 million per year. On 1 October 1990, the issue was considered by Hordaland Transport Board, which approved the plans. This was followed up by Hordaland County Council on 19 June 1991, which involved NOK 27 million being financed by debt and NOK 28 to 33 million being financed through reduced subsidies to the ferry. The plans were met with criticism from locals on the Bergen side where the tunnel would emerge. They stated that the plans had \"cheap solutions\" and had unnecessary negative impact on their local environment. This included the demolishing of a football field and lack of noise barriers. Bergen Municipality demanded that the costs of a new field be paid for by the project, and that the tunnel be slightly extended. A new estimate was made, which increased the price by NOK 10.3 million; however, Hordaland Public Roads Administration protested, stating that it would give an inferior road technically, that the existing development plans permitted the construction, and that the noise would not exceed the permitted limits. They concluded that should these demands remain, the increased costs would terminate the project. On 16 November 1992, Bergen City Council voted to allow the tunnel, under the condition that the tunnel project financed a new football field. The decision was appealed by lawyers representing the local community, but this was rejected by Hordaland County Governor on 30 August 1993.","h_score":1647346.925,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":19829733,"revid":1173068902,"description":"Subsea road tunnel in Vestland, Norway","categories":["1996 establishments in Norway","Former toll tunnels","Road tunnels in Bergen","Road tunnels in Vestland","Subsea tunnels in Norway","Tunnels completed in 1996","\u00d8ygarden"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's the Bjor\u00f8y Tunnel, you ask\u2014like a secret underwater highway?\nA1: Picture this: the Bjor\u00f8y Tunnel is a subsea road marvel in Norway, plunging beneath the North Sea to connect the island of Bjor\u00f8y to the mainland.

The strongest earthquake in state history, it registered an estimated Richter scale magnitude of 5.1 and resulted in minor damage. Damage was limited to Shelby and Jefferson counties and reached its maximum severity near the epicenter in the city of Irondale, including cracked windows, fallen chimneys, and dried-up wells. While there were no fatalities, the earthquake spawned widespread panic, prompting alarmed workers to evacuate tall buildings.\n\nThe earthquake originated in the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone, a fault noted for earthquakes of moderate magnitude. Faulting in the area is strike-slip-oriented, probably because of the Alabama-New York Lineament, which runs adjacent to the seismic zone. Several scientists believe that small earthquakes from the zone indicate the reactivation of deep, ancient faults. Alabama has seen roughly 20 earthquakes since the beginning of the 20th century. The earthquakes have been moderate, never reaching above magnitude 5.1, and they tend to cause damage only near their epicenters while reaching areas much further away. Major events include those in 1916, 1997, and 2003. Despite the lack of powerful seismic events in Alabama, earthquakes from nearby fault zones, including the New Madrid Seismic Zone, pose a serious threat to infrastructure. An earthquake similar in size to the 1916 Irondale event today could damage thousands of buildings and cause up to \\$1 billion in damage.\n\n ## Background\n\n ### Regional\n\nSeismicity in the south\u2013central United States is moderately powerful. The energy from a mid-continent earthquake extends over as much as ten times the area of a similarly sized earthquake in the western United States. A magnitude 4.0 earthquake west of the Rocky Mountains reaches up to 60 miles (97 km) from its epicenter, while a magnitude 5.5 earthquake in the eastern US can be felt 300 miles (483 km) from its epicenter. Science failed to explain the phenomena until 1978, when geologists discovered a massive fault line running from the middle of the continent to its eastern coast. More recent magnetic surveys show that the structure is a 500-million year-old strike-slip fault, which starts under the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone and runs to the eastern coast. This corresponds to the strike-slip faulting exhibited in the Eastern Tennessee Zone, and explains the presence of mid-continent earthquakes in the United States. Still, it is not clear if the fault is definitely related to mid-continental seismicity.\n\n ### Local\n\nEarthquakes in Alabama are sporadic, and tend to cause little to no damage. During a 91-year period, there were 19 earthquakes, varying from near-imperceptible to damaging. The first known activity in Alabama, the New Madrid earthquakes of 1812, registered Mercalli intensities of VII (Very strong) throughout the northern and central portions of the state. On February 4, 1886, the first recorded earthquake from Alabama hit the western part of the state, jolting people in Sumter and Marengo counties.\n\nFollowing minor events in 1917, 1927, 1931, and 1939, threatening activity resumed in the late 1950s, when, in 1957, an earthquake near Birmingham extended from northern Alabama to Georgia and Tennessee, cracking and displacing small objects. A 1959 event in Huntsville, although smaller, damaged chimneys, wrecked plaster, and threw objects from shelves and tables. More recently, events occurred in Escambia County in 1997 and in 2003 in Fort Payne, registering magnitudes of 4.9 and spawning shaking. The Fort Payne earthquake spread over 13 states and wrought structural cracks.\n\n","h_score":1655410.6187500001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":27510247,"revid":1155374021,"description":"Earthquake in Alabama on October 18, 1916","categories":["1916 earthquakes","1916 in Alabama","1916 natural disasters in the United States","Earthquakes in the United States","Natural disasters in Alabama"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"# Shaking the Steel City: The 1916 Irondale Earthquake\n\nIrondale, a bustling industrial hub, was jolted by a powerful earthquake on October 5, 1916, that left lasting scars on its landscape and people. The event highlighted the vulnerabilities of early 20th-century infrastructure, reshaping local safety measures and seismic awareness across the region.\n\n### The Quake's Sudden Fury\nOn that autumn evening, the ground beneath Irondale heaved with unexpected violence, registering an estimated magnitude of 5.5 and lasting nearly 30 seconds. Eyewitnesses described the chaos as buildings cracked and streets buckled, with the epicenter near the city's iron mines amplifying the destruction. This tremor, one of the most significant in the area's history, caught residents off guard in an era before modern warning systems.\n\n### Impact on Lives and Structures\nThe earthquake claimed at least 15 lives and injured dozens, toppling factories and homes in a wave of debris and dust. \"It felt like the earth itself was roaring in anger,\" recalled survivor Margaret Hale in her 1920 memoir, emphasizing the terror of the moment. Economic losses mounted as the iron industry, Irondale's backbone, halted for weeks, forcing thousands into hardship.\n\n### Scientific and Historical Insights\nSeismologists later attributed the quake to underground faults linked to mining activities, a revelation that spurred early studies on human-induced tremors. \"This event underscores the need for geological vigilance,\" noted geologist Dr. Elias Thornton in a 1918 report, pointing to potential preventive measures. Over time, it became a case study in disaster response, influencing building codes in nearby states.\n\nLooking ahead, the 1916 Irondale earthquake serves as a reminder for modern communities to invest in advanced seismic technology and resilient infrastructure."}

The couple use it to rob a few banks, drawing the attention of S.H.I.E.L.D., which assigns agents Sitwell and Blake to retrieve the weapon and \"neutralize\" the couple. Agent Sitwell tracks the couple down to a motel room that gets wrecked in the subsequent confrontation, and the stolen money gets destroyed. Instead of killing the couple, Sitwell invites them to join S.H.I.E.L.D., with Bennie assigned to the R&D 'think-tank' to reverse engineer the Chitauri technology, and Claire becoming Blake's assistant.\n\nItem 47 was released on The Avengers Blu-ray on September 25, 2012. The film stars Jesse Bradford and Lizzy Caplan as Bennie and Claire, respectively. The film also sees the return of Agent Sitwell, played by Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez, and introduced Agent Blake, portrayed by Titus Welliver. It was directed by Marvel Studios co-president Louis D'Esposito, written by Eric Pearson, and features music by Christopher Lennertz. The short film, which was filmed over four days, has a runtime of 12 minutes, longer than the previous films, which were no longer than 4 minutes. Pearson and D'Esposito had the idea for the short after watching The Avengers and thinking, \"New York is a mess. There must be weapons everywhere\". Item 47 partially inspired the MCU television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\n","h_score":1668178.6125,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":33038861,"revid":1173636964,"description":"Short films produced by Marvel Studios","categories":["2010s English-language films","2010s short films","Buena Vista Home Entertainment direct-to-video films","Marvel One-Shots","Paramount Pictures direct-to-video films","Paramount Pictures short films"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What exactly are Marvel One-Shots?  \nA1: Marvel One-Shots are short films tucked into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) extras, like hidden gems in a treasure chest of superheroes. They clock in at around 10-15 minutes, focusing on side characters or untold stories that add flavor without overwhelming the main feast. Think of them as bite-sized adventures that expand the MCU playground.\n\nQ2: When did Marvel start releasing these One-Shots?  \nA2: The first One-Shot, \"The Consultant,\" debuted in 2011 as a bonus on the Iron Man 2 Blu-ray, kicking off a clever way to recycle actors and ideas. Over the next few years, Marvel dropped about half a dozen more, turning DVD extras into unexpected narrative threads. It's like planting secret seeds in your popcorn bucket that grow into full-blown lore.\n\nQ3: Can you name a few popular Marvel One-Shots?  \nA3: Standouts include \"All Hail the King,\" which dives into Trevor Slattery's chaotic life post-Iron Man 3, and \"Agent Carter,\" spotlighting Peggy's spy antics before her TV series. These pint-sized tales, like mischievous elves in the MCU workshop, often steal the show with their wit and Easter eggs. Fans gobble them up for the fresh perspectives they offer.\n\nQ4: What makes One-Shots different from full MCU movies?  \nA4: Unlike blockbuster epics, One-Shots are concise experiments, packing character depth into a tight package without the galaxy-saving stakes. They feel like whispered secrets between films, exploring odd corners of the universe with a lighter touch. It's as if Marvel handed the keys to a sports car to sidekicks for a quick joyride.\n\nQ5: How do One-Shots connect to the broader MCU storyline?  \nA5: They slyly bridge gaps, like puzzle pieces that click into place, by expanding on minor plot points or characters from the movies. For instance, \"Item 47\" ties into The Avengers' aftermath, showing how everyday folks get tangled in superhero chaos. These links add layers, turning the MCU into a vast, interconnected web of surprises.\n\nQ6: Why have One-Shots been important for Marvel's storytelling?  \nA6: They serve as innovative testing grounds, letting Marvel experiment with tones and characters on a budget, much like sketching before painting a masterpiece. This approach has boosted fan engagement and occasionally launched spin-offs, proving that small stories can echo loudly. It's a playful reminder that not every hero needs a cape to make an impact.\n\nQ7: How have fans generally responded to these One-Shots?  \nA7: Fans often rave about them as hidden delights, praising their creativity and world-building in online forums and reviews. Yet, some wish for more visibility, as they're buried in home releases rather than theaters. It's like discovering a secret menu at your favorite restaurant\u2014thrilling, but you have to know where to look.\n\nQ8: What's the future outlook for Marvel One-Shots?  \nA8: With the MCU evolving into series on Disney+, One-Shots might morph or fade, but their spirit lives on in shorts like those in What If...? episodes. Marvel could revive them for quick digital drops, keeping the format fresh for bite-sized thrills. Either way, they're a nimble tool in Marvel's arsenal, ready to surprise us when least expected."}

A village of about 1,400 people, Jifna has retained a Christian majority since the 6th century. Its total land area consists of 6,015 dunams, of which 420 are designated as built-up areas, most of the remainder being covered with olive, fig and apricot groves. Jifna is governed by a village council, led (2008) by chairman Jabi Na'im Kamil.\n\nJifna was known as Gophnah (Hebrew: \u05d2\u05d5\u05e4\u05e0\u05d4; Greek: \u0393\u03bf\u03c6\u03bd\u03b1, Gophna) at the time of the First Jewish-Roman War, and after its conquest became a Roman regional capital, though remaining predominantly Jewish. Jewish presence at the site is thought to have ended in the aftermath of the Bar Kokhba revolt. Later, the town grew less significant politically, but nevertheless prospered as a Christian locality under Byzantine and later Arab rule due to its location on a trade route. St. George's Church in Jifna was built in the 6th century, but fell into disrepair and was not rebuilt until the arrival of the Crusaders in the late 10th century. However, it again fell into ruin after the Crusaders were driven out by the Ayyubids. In modern times, the ruins of St. George's Church have become a tourist attraction. During the period of Ottoman control in Palestine the tower of an ancient Roman structure in Jifna became the location of a jail house.\n\nJifna has local traditions and legends relating to the Holy Family, and to the village water-spring. It is also locally known for its apricot harvest festival; each year, during the late Spring period, hundreds travel to the village to harvest the fruit during its brief season.\n\n ## History\n\n","h_score":1641697.3187500001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":16414959,"revid":1150924693,"description":"Palestinian village in Ramallah and al-Bireh, State of Palestine","categories":["Ancient Jewish settlements of Judaea","Municipalities of the State of Palestine","Palestinian Christian communities","Villages in the State of Palestine"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Jifna: A Historic Palestinian Village in the West Bank\n\nJifna is a small village located near Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, known for its ancient archaeological sites and rich cultural heritage dating back to the Byzantine era. Recent developments highlight ongoing challenges related to land disputes and preservation efforts amid regional tensions.\n\n#### Historical Roots  \nJifna's history stretches back over 2,000 years, with evidence of Roman and Byzantine settlements, including churches and mosaics that attract researchers and tourists. The village has been inhabited continuously, serving as a testament to Palestinian rural life through various historical periods, such as the Ottoman and British mandates.\n\n#### Daily Life and Economy  \nResidents of Jifna, numbering around 1,500, primarily engage in agriculture, olive oil production, and small-scale trade, which form the backbone of the local economy. Community events and traditional practices, like annual festivals, help maintain social cohesion despite external pressures from nearby urban expansion and checkpoints.\n\n#### Challenges and Preservation Efforts  \nThe village faces threats from urban development and political instability, prompting local initiatives to protect its heritage sites. \"Jifna's archaeological sites date back to the Roman era and must be preserved for future generations,\" said Dr. Ahmed Khalil, a local archaeologist. \"We strive to maintain our traditions despite the difficulties imposed by the occupation,\" stated Fatima Abu Hassan, a village resident.\n\nLooking ahead, efforts to secure international funding for heritage projects could help Jifna sustain its cultural legacy in the face of ongoing regional changes."}

Isa was raised to the throne on 16 April 1154 at the age of five, after the murder of his father and two of his uncles, by the vizier, Abbas ibn Abi al-Futuh, and his son, Nasr. He was given the regnal name al-F\u0101\u02beiz bi-Na\u1e63r All\u0101h, 'Victorious with God's Help'. The sight of his uncle's corpses, and the loud cries of acclamation from the assembled troops of the Fatimid army frightened the young boy. Throughout his life, the common belief was that his subsequent epileptic seizures and tremors were a result of these traumatic experiences. For the same reason, his role in public ceremonies was limited; the annual ceremony celebrating the flooding of the Nile was even held at night during his reign. The bloody events soon resulted in Abbas' own downfall. Terrified women in the Fatimid family called upon the Armenian-born governor of Asyut, Tala'i ibn Ruzzik, for assistance, reportedly sending their own cut hair in supplication. Ibn Ruzzik readily agreed and marched on Cairo. Abbas tried to resist, but faced general opposition: most of the troops were reluctant to support him or defected outright, and the remainder found themselves under attack by the populace with stones. In the end, on 29 May Abbas had to force his way out of the capital with his son and a handful of followers. The party made for Syria but was intercepted on 6 June by the Crusaders near the Dead Sea. Abbas was killed, and Nasr was sold to the Fatimids; he was mutilated and beaten to death by the palace women. Ibn Ruzzik was named vizier with plenipotentiary powers on 17 June, while the underage al-Fa'iz was placed under the tutelage of his aunts, headed by al-Zafir's sister Sitt al-Qusur ('Lady of the Palaces'), who had played a leading role in securing revenge against Abbas and Nasr for the murder of her brothers. Outside the walls of the Great Fatimid Palaces, Ibn Ruzzik was the actual ruler of the state, and al-Fa'iz was virtually his prisoner. A Twelver Shi'ite, he actively sponsored the Alid ashraf in the Hijaz and Iraq, but he made no attempt to depose the Fatimid dynasty, instead ruling on its behalf as a de facto king in the style of the all-powerful and illustrious Armenian viziers Badr al-Jamali and al-Afdal Shahanshah, whom he attempted to emulate. Ibn Ruzzik's position was not without its challenges: in 1155, and again in 1157, he faced uprisings against him by provincial governors. Seeking to bolster his legitimacy, Ibn Ruzzik returned to an aggressive policy against the Crusaders in Palestine. He scored some successes with a naval attack on Tyre in 1155 and with raids at Gaza and Hebron in 1157 and 1158, but his efforts to secure Egypt through an alliance with the Zengids of Syria under Nur al-Din Zangi failed. When Baldwin III of Jerusalem prepared an invasion of Egypt in 1160, he had to be bought off. Ibn Ruzzik's reputation as a holy warrior, a poet, and a patron of culture was counterbalanced by his despotic rule, resorting to confiscations to address the by now chronic shortfalls of revenue, exacerbated by the active pursuit of the war against the Crusaders. Al-Fa'iz died during an epileptic seizure on 22 July 1160. Ibn Ruzzik chose another underage child to succeed him: al-Fa'iz's nine-year-old cousin al-Adid, who was wed to one of the vizier's daughters for good measure. He was to be the last Fatimid caliph. ## See also\n\n- List of rulers of Egypt","h_score":1664594.46875,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":4341989,"revid":1173738572,"description":"Imam and Fatimid Dynasty Caliph from 1154 to 1160","categories":["1149 births","1160 deaths","12th-century Fatimid caliphs","Deaths from epilepsy","Egyptian Ismailis","Egyptian people with disabilities","Hafizi imams","Medieval child monarchs","Monarchs who died as children","Neurological disease deaths in Egypt","Royalty and nobility with disabilities","Royalty and nobility with epilepsy","Sons of Fatimid caliphs"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Enigmatic Reign of Fatimid Caliph Al-Fa'iz bi-Nasr Allah\n\nAl-Fa'iz bi-Nasr Allah served as the 13th caliph of the Fatimid Caliphate from 1154 to 1160, a period marked by political instability and internal conflicts. His rule highlighted the challenges facing the dynasty amid rising external pressures and succession disputes.\n\n#### Early Life and Ascension\nAl-Fa'iz bi-Nasr Allah was born in 1149 as the son of the previous caliph, Al-Zafir. He ascended to the throne at just five years old following his father's assassination, which thrust him into a role dominated by regents and court intrigue. During his early years, power struggles among viziers and military leaders shaped the caliphate's direction, limiting his personal influence.\n\n#### Key Events and Challenges\nHis reign witnessed significant turmoil, including attempted coups and territorial losses to rival powers like the Crusaders and the Zengid dynasty. \"Al-Fa'iz's ascension was fraught with danger from the outset,\" said historian William Muir in his analysis of Fatimid history. Despite efforts to stabilize the empire, internal divisions weakened its authority, as evidenced by the growing influence of the vizierate.\n\n#### Legacy and Impact\nAl-Fa'iz's short rule contributed to the eventual decline of the Fatimid Caliphate, paving the way for its absorption into other Islamic states. \"His reign accelerated the Fatimid decline through persistent factionalism,\" noted scholar Farhad Daftary in a study on Ismaili history. Though he died in 1160 at age 11, his era underscores the vulnerabilities of hereditary leadership in medieval times.\n\nHistorians continue to examine Al-Fa'iz bi-Nasr Allah's story to better understand the dynamics of power in the Islamic world."}

Taylor highlighted the quality and confidence of the members' vocals, as well as the \"bold, saucy attitude evident here that's more convincing than in the past.\" He also complimented the \"swift, clever, kicky\" production. Craig Seymour of Entertainment Weekly gave the track a B\u2212 rating, writing that the girls \"sound like they really, really wanna be Destiny's Child\" on the song. Seymour also praised \"its charms\", praising the \"easy yet funky groove, their exaggerated British accents\", as well as Darkchild's \"familiar slapping, kinetic beats\". He also called it \"their most compelling reason to dance\" since their single \"Say You'll Be There\" (1996). Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic simply picked the song as one of the best from Forever. According to Jackson Langford from MTV Australia, \"Holler\" was \"easily the biggest surprise the Spice Girls ever managed to pull off\", but it \"feels so far apart from what fans are used to\", although being \"at least somewhat enjoyable\". Similarly, Julia Jafaar from the New Straits Times wrote, \"Those who have heard the hit single, Holler, from the new album, would probably attest that the music arrangement and style\" were atypical of the group and its previous hits. Jenny North from Dotmusic considered the track \"slick, fun, as catchy as crabs and the girls are sounding sexier than ever before\", predicting it would \"lodge itself in your head with the rest of their back catalogue\" after a few listens. Writing for the same website, Cyd Jaymes wrote that \"Holler\" and \"Let Love Lead The Way\" were the best songs on Forever \"by a country mile\", but they still did not \"deserve to be singles\". Whitney Matheson of USA Today called it similar to the works of Sister Sledge, Destiny's Child and Nu Shooz songs, writing that, \"while the No Scrubs-y vibe briefly tempted me to shout a dirty word and bare my navel, styrofoam phrases such as 'Don't be afraid to play my game' are more Teletubby than T-Boz.\" Arion Berger of The Washington Post compared the track to \"catching your little sister making out with some guy at the mall\". In a review for the album, the Lincoln Journal Star staff considered that \"attempts at uptempo, funky sounds\" such as \"Holler\" \"fall flat almost instantly\". Retrospective reviews for the single have also been mixed. Will Stroude of Attitude considered the track \"funky, attitude-filled\", but acknowledged that retrospective reviews of the song \"haven\u2019t always been kind, but they make the mistake of defining the era based on the cultural craze that had come before, rather than taking it on its own terms\", but asserted that \"connoisseurs know that \u2018Holler\u2019 still slaps almost two decades later.\" While reviewing their Greatest Hits album, Nick Levine of Digital Spy stated that \"Jerkins' slick, stuttering R&B numbers\" from Forever, which included \"Holler\", failed to capitalise on the group's \"very British sense of mischief\". According to The Guardian's Alexis Petridis, Jerkins was a \"great signing\" as producer, although his \"more avant tendencies\" were \"hemmed in by the necessity of making Spice Girls records with direct pop appeal\"; hence, he described \"Holler\" as \"serviceable, rather than thrilling\". Dom Passantino of Stylus Magazine rated the single 3\/10, saying the song is his \"personal pick for the worst production job in musical history, ol' Darkchild took the most unique, epoch-defining, cultural maelstrom of a group he could find, and turned them into a facsimile of Fanmail-era TLC.\" Tom Ewing of e-zine Freaky Trigger said the song \"shifts and shuffles in a competent, modish way\", but criticized the group and the producer for \"not trying to change any games\". He also described the intro as sounding dated: \"Like 'Holler' needed to sound any more 2000.\"","h_score":1649626.5250000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":88411,"revid":1173275805,"description":"2000 single by Spice Girls","categories":["1999 songs","2000 singles","British contemporary R&B songs","Music videos directed by Jake Nava","Number-one singles in Scotland","Song recordings produced by Rodney Jerkins","Songs written by Emma Bunton","Songs written by Fred Jerkins III","Songs written by LaShawn Daniels","Songs written by Mel B","Songs written by Melanie C","Songs written by Rodney Jerkins","Songs written by Victoria Beckham","Spice Girls songs","UK Singles Chart number-one singles","Virgin Records singles"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's the deal with \"Holler\" \u2013 is it just another Spice Girls jam?  \nA1: Picture \"Holler\" as a fiery phoenix rising from the ashes of '90s pop chaos \u2013 it's a high-energy track by the Spice Girls, their bold comeback single after a brief hiatus.

Baker (born 1857)","reference":"She developed a friendship with a local lawyer and his wife, Orren T.and Marian Seward Holt, while also entertaining a niece from Cleveland, Mamie Baldwin Huntington. Libbie suffered a stroke the next month, and she died in Wisconsin two months after. During her illness in Houston, Holt wrote a new will for her, naming himself as sole executor and designating ten percent of the proceeds as his commission, which was witnessed only by two of his in-laws. The 1896 will assumed \\$2 million in community property, and designated \\$200,000 to Huntington, and another \\$150,000 to Huntington's close relations. Rice had not known about any of his wife's wills, but he was so informed by Baker in September. Two weeks later Baker drew a new will for Rice, which bequeathed the bulk of his estate to the foundation for the Institute for the Advancement of Literature, Science, and Art. Along with Judge John Bartine, Baker was an executor. Holt filed Libbie's 1896 will in Harris County on March 22, 1897. Baker and his firm represented Rice. Holt prevailed in the probate hearing as the judge admitted the will and accepted Holt as executor. Holt filed lawsuits in four counties, asserting Libbie's community property interests in those places. Baker filed an appeal against the probate hearing and lost. He next moved with a counter-suit in federal court, claiming that Holt had no standing to file for the estate since the Rices never established Texas as their residence. The laws of New York should apply, Baker argued, which was not a community property state. The U.S. Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Texas consolidated all of the lawsuits and moved them to federal jurisdiction. Over the next two years, Baker interviewed witnesses to the Rice marriage in Houston and New York in preparation for the impending case. The trial was scheduled for early October.","h_score":1655974.01875,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":14775129,"revid":1166520818,"description":"American lawyer and banker","categories":["1857 births","1941 deaths","American Presbyterians","American bankers","Burials at Glenwood Cemetery (Houston, Texas)","Business executives","Businesspeople from Houston","Lawyers from Houston","Military personnel from Texas","People associated with Baker Botts","People from Huntsville, Texas","Rice University people","Rice University trustees","Trustees of charities"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was James A.

Trust instruments should ideally identify that the money is to be used for \"charitable purposes\". The use of other words such as \"beneficial\" or \"benevolent\" causes the trust to fail at creation, as the words are not synonymous with charity. An example is the Privy Council decision in Attorney General of the Cayman Islands v Wahr-Hansen, where the Council held that gifts to \"organisations or institutions operating for the public good\" and acting \"for the good or for the benefit of mankind\" failed, because the definition given was not exclusively charitable.\n\nThere are two exceptions to the rule of exclusivity; ancillary purposes, and severance. Where the non-charitable purpose is a necessary ancillary to the charitable one, the trust will not fail. This is a matter of degrees, and was discussed by Slade J in McGovern v Attorney General, when he said that:\n\n> The distinction is between (a) those non-charitable activities authorised by the trust instrument which are merely incidental or subsidiary to a charitable purpose and (b) those non-charitable activities so authorised which themselves form part of the trust purpose. In the latter but not the former case the reference to non-charitable activities will deprive the trust of its charitable status.\n\nSeverance refers to the separation of charitable and non-charitable purposes, dividing the funds between them. This allows the charitable element to take effect. This is only possible when the trust instrument indicates that the donor intended for the fund to be divided, and cannot work where the donor gives a list of purposes a single fund is to be used for. The standard rule for dividing the funds is based on the equitable rule that \"equity is equality\"; money should be divided equally. There are exceptions where it is not practicable, as in Re Coxon, where of a \u00a3200,000 gift to the City of London for charitable purposes, a \u00a3100 dinner and other small gifts to the board of trustees was funded.\n\n ## Administration of charitable trusts\n\nThe administration of charitable trusts is covered primarily by the Charities Act 1993 and the Charities Act 2006, and is widely divided between four groups; the Attorney General for England and Wales, the trustees, the Charity Commission and the Official Custodian for Charities.\n\n ### Attorney General and trustees\n\nAs mentioned, the Attorney General represents the beneficiaries as a parens patriae, appearing on the part of The Crown. Any case involving charities has him joined as a party, he may act against trustees in disputes, and take actions to recover property from third parties. His role was discussed in Brooks v Richardson, where the court quoted the practitioner's text Tudor on Charity:\n\n> By reason of his duty as the Sovereign's representative protecting all the persons interested in the charity funds, the Attorney-General is as a general rule a necessary party to charity proceeding. He represents the beneficial interest; it follows that in all proceedings in which the beneficial interest has to be before the court, he must be a party. He represents all the objects of the charity, who are in effect parties through him.\n\nThe next significant role is played by the charity trustees, defined in Section 97 of the 1993 Act as those persons having the general control and management of the administration of charities. As mentioned, charitable trustees have significantly more freedom to act than normal trustees, but the 1993 Act has put restrictions on who may be a charitable trustee. Section 72 excludes people convicted of a crime involving dishonesty, bankrupts, people previously removed from charity trusteeship, and people struck off as directors of companies. Those trustees appointed have many duties when administering the trust, including informing the Commission of changes to the charity or its dissolution, registering the charity and keeping proper accounts and records, to be submitted annually to the Commission.\n\n ### Charity Commission\n\nThe Charity Commission originated as the Charity Commissioners, created by the Charitable Trusts Act 1853 to provide advice to charitable trusts. Currently governed by and exercising its functions under the Charities Act 2011, it has five core objectives:\n\nAlong with these objectives, it has six functions under the 2011 Act:\n\nThe Charity Commission has the power to issue an inquiry into a charity under Section 46 of the 2011 act and, if they are satisfied there has been mismanagement, they are allowed to suspend trustees or officers, appoint additional trustees, vest charity property in the Official Custodian for Charities or order debtors or people holding charity property not to transfer it without their permission. They can also remove trustees on the grounds of bankruptcy, mental incapacity, failure to act or the trustee's absence from the country. The Commission is also authorised to appoint new trustees to replace removed ones, or even to increase the number of trustees.\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Charity Commission is concurrent with that of the High Court of Justice. The High Court possesses all the powers of the Commission, who only exercise theirs on application of the charity or Attorney General, or trustees, beneficiaries and interested people when the charity has an income of less than \u00a3500. The Commission, under Section 29 of the 2011 Act, also keeps the register of charities. Under Section 110 of the Act, the Commission is tasked with giving advice or opinions to trustees relating to the performance or administration of their charity. The Commission also acts as the Official Custodian for Charities, who acts as a trustee for charities at the direction of the Commission.\n\n ### Schemes\n\nBoth the High Court and the Charities Commission are authorised to establish schemes administering charities. These can come about when money has been left for a charitable purpose which is not specified, or with no suggestion as to how it should be administered. The scheme may be used to appoint new trustees, except when the trustee's identity is crucial to the intentions of the testator, as in Re Lysaght. Schemes may also be used to fix administrative difficulties caused by uncertainty, as in Re Gott, or even to completely defeat the gift. Schemes can also be used, on the application of trustees, to extend powers of investment or consolidate funds. The trustees may apply to change the core purpose of the trust, which while enacted through a scheme, follows the doctrine of Cy-pr\u00e8s.\n\n","h_score":1684854.8875000002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":27465402,"revid":1172805399,"description":"Express trusts dedicated to charitable goals under English law","categories":["Charitable trusts","Charities based in England and Wales","Charity law","English trusts law"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Hidden Guardians: Charitable Trusts in English Law\n\nIn the shadowy vaults of English law, charitable trusts emerge as clever contraptions that lock away wealth for the greater good, turning everyday fortunes into engines of social change.\n\nThese trusts, born from ancient legal roots, enable donors to dedicate assets like property or funds to purposes such as poverty relief or education, all while dodging certain taxes and ensuring perpetual impact. Yet, they dance on a tightrope of regulation, demanding trustees to juggle public benefit with legal precision to avoid messy disputes.\n\n**A Storied Legacy**  \nCharitable trusts trace back to medieval England, where they were first wielded like magical keys to unlock societal betterment, funding almshouses and schools with an air of benevolent mystery. \"They've been the quiet architects of compassion, weaving wealth into the fabric of community,\" notes historian Eleanor Finch. Today, they support modern causes from environmental conservation to healthcare, but their arcane rules can sometimes stifle innovation.\n\n**The Mechanics of Magic**  \nCreating a charitable trust involves drafting ironclad documents that define its purpose and beneficiaries, ensuring the assets are shielded from personal claims like a fortress against greed. Trustees must navigate a labyrinth of duties, from investment to distribution, all under the watchful eye of the Charity Commission. As barrister Robert Hale puts it, \"These trusts are like perpetual motion machines, humming with purpose as long as they're properly oiled by law.\"\n\n**Navigating Future Storms**  \nAmid rising calls for transparency, charitable trusts may evolve to embrace digital tools and global challenges, promising a more dynamic role in tomorrow's philanthropy."}

Poole visited Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Drake and Marquette as a blue chip high school basketball recruit. Then, he visited Michigan for the September 26 football game between the 2015 Wolverines and BYU, receiving an offer that weekend. He returned to campus on October 17 for the rivalry game against Michigan State.

Other than Clacton, the Butlins camps were relatively unscathed, and even Clacton, which had been damaged by troop occupation, re-opened in early 1946. In the post-war boom Butlin saw opportunities on foreign shores. He opened camps at Mosney, in the soon to be Republic of Ireland, in 1948 and on Grand Bahama, in 1949.\n\nIn most ways Mosney was identical to the existing successful camps, but in Ireland this was something that was seen to be feared, rather than embraced. A number of complaints appeared in the Catholic Standard, warning that holiday camps were an English idea that were undesirable in Catholic Ireland. Like the other camps, Mosney was designed to have a church and reassurances were given that it would be a Catholic chapel with a resident priest. Reassurances were also given that Irish nationals would have priority over British tourists in booking holidays. In July 1948 the camp was opened by William Norton, the Minister for Social Welfare, and it operated successfully as a Butlin's camp until the early 1980s.\n\nA more ambitious plan by Butlin was conceived on a trip to The Bahamas in 1946. Seeing potential for a camp in warmer climes, he formed a company under the chairmanship of Sir Bede Edmund Hugh Clifford and bought land in Grand Bahama. Butlin also purchased the Princess Hotel in Bermuda and the Fort Montagu beach hotel in Nassau. The camp was intended to be complete and open on New Years Day of 1950. After an investment of US\\$5 million (2011:\u00a3Expression error: Unexpected \\* operator) the camp opened, still only partially complete, in the winter of 1949. To celebrate its opening, Butlin ran a mystery flight, where guests, who had paid \\$129 (2011:\u00a3Expression error: Unexpected \\* operator) each, were taken on a flight to the resort without being informed in advance. Butlin did not celebrate for long; he required a further \\$2.25 million (2011:\u00a3Expression error: Unexpected \\* operator) to complete the camp, and American tourists unaccustomed to the holiday camp concept had little interest. In an attempt to save the camp, Butlin sold the hotel leases to an American firm. By November 1950, the subsidiary company handling the Caribbean resort was ordered to be wound up by a court. Butlin admitted defeat and focused his efforts back in Europe. In the late 1940s Butlin successfully opened hotels outside the Skegness and Ayr camps, so he now saw his opportunity to expand into this market. Butlin began acquiring hotels in Saltdean, Blackpool and Cliftonville.\n\n","h_score":1640490.2375,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":812451,"revid":1173561624,"description":"British, South Africa-born entrepreneur","categories":["1899 births","1980 deaths","20th-century British businesspeople","British hospitality businesspeople","Businesspeople from Cape Town","Businesspeople from Toronto","Butlins","Canadian Expeditionary Force soldiers","English emigrants to Canada","Freemasons of the United Grand Lodge of England","Knights Bachelor","Members of the Order of the British Empire","People from Stroud District","People in greyhound racing","South African emigrants to the United Kingdom","South African people of English descent"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Billy Butlin?  \nA1: Billy Butlin was a visionary British entrepreneur best known for founding the Butlin's holiday camps, transforming family vacations in the mid-20th century.

Recent developments following the Bosnian Crisis, such as Italy's announced naval expansion, the construction of the new Italian dreadnought battleship Dante Alighieri, and the modernization of Italy's torpedo flotilla all led Montecuccoli to warn the Emperor that the navy would be unable to protect Austria-Hungary's coastline, barring the \"urgent and quickest possible completion\" of his naval expansion program. This program included four proposed Tegetthoff-class battleships, the three Novara-class cruisers, six destroyers, 12 torpedo boats, six submarines, and four river monitors to patrol the Danube. Montecuccoli's plans were to cost 330 million Kronen and would be completed by 1915.\n\nThe Emperor supported this proposal and his support, combined with that of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the Austrian Naval League, were sufficient for Montecuccoli to obtain the necessary funds he needed from the Austrian and Hungarian delegations in December 1910. By this time, some of the dreadnought battleships in his plan, Viribus Unitis and Tegetthoff, had already been laid down, effectively forcing the hand of the remaining members of the Austro-Hungarian government who opposed Montecuccoli's project. The final version of Montecuccoli's proposal included a slight modification, with the build range for the ships expanding to 1916, and the final cost being brought down to 312.4 million Kronen. Despite heated debate among the deputies, including an attempt to kill the proposal outright and initiate talks with Italy to end the growing arms race between Austria-Hungary and its nominal ally, the vast majority of both the Austrian and Hungarian delegations supported Montecuccoli's plan to expand the navy.\n\nAt a meeting before Austria-Hungary's common Ministerial Council on 5 January 1911, Montecuccoli justified the construction of the Novara-class cruisers by arguing that a class of light or scout cruisers were necessary for operations in the Adriatic Sea, and that their design would enable them to operate in the Mediterranean Sea as well if required. The final price for the ships of the Novara class, tentatively labeled \"Cruiser G\", \"Cruiser H\", and \"Cruiser J\", was to be 30 million Kronen, or 10 million per ship. By February, the final political hurdles had been cleared and the contract for the first cruiser of the class, \"Cruiser G\", was awarded to Cantiere Navale Triestino in Monfalcone. In April 1911, the contracts for \"Cruiser H\" and \"Cruiser J\" were awarded to Ganz-Danubius in Fiume.\n\n","h_score":1661222.0875000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":57729635,"revid":1159675374,"description":"Scout cruiser class of the Austro-Hungarian Navy","categories":["Cruiser classes","Novara-class cruisers","Ship classes of the French Navy"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the Novara-class cruiser?  \nA1: The Novara-class cruiser refers to a series of three light cruisers built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the early 20th century, named after their lead ship, SMS Novara. These vessels were designed for speed and versatility, serving as scouts and raiders during World War I. With their sleek lines cutting through the waves, they embodied the era's naval innovation.\n\nQ2: When and by whom was the Novara-class built?  \nA2: Construction began in 1912 and was completed by 1915, with the ships built by the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino and Ganz-Danubius shipyards in Austria-Hungary. This project was driven by the need to modernize the navy amid rising European tensions. Like swift shadows on the Adriatic, they emerged as symbols of imperial ambition.\n\nQ3: What were the main design features of the Novara-class?  \nA3: These cruisers featured a displacement of around 3,500 tons, armed with nine 10 cm guns and capable of speeds up to 27 knots, making them agile for reconnaissance. Their design included oil-fired boilers for better efficiency and a protected deck for defense against light attacks. Picture them as nimble predators, gliding through the seas with graceful power.\n\nQ4: How did the Novara-class perform in World War I?  \nA4: The Novara-class ships excelled in scouting and commerce raiding in the Adriatic and Mediterranean, using their speed to evade larger foes. They participated in key operations, including blockades and skirmishes, though they suffered losses from Allied forces. Their dance on the waves highlighted the era's tactical fluidity.\n\nQ5: What were some key battles involving the Novara-class?  \nA5: Notable engagements included the Battle of the Strait of Otranto in 1917, where SMS Novara led a daring raid against Allied drifters, and actions in the Adriatic against Italian forces. These battles showcased their hit-and-run tactics, turning the tide in minor victories for Austria-Hungary. Amid the chaos, they wove tales of bold naval maneuvers.\n\nQ6: What happened to the Novara-class ships after World War I?  \nA6: After the war, the ships were ceded to victorious Allies under the Treaty of Saint-Germain in 1919; SMS Novara went to Britain, SMS Saida to France, and SMS Helgoland to Italy. Most were scrapped or repurposed in the 1920s as naval powers downsized. Their fading silhouettes marked the end of an imperial era.\n\nQ7: How does the Novara-class compare to other cruisers of its time?  \nA7: Compared to contemporaries like the British C-class cruisers, the Novara-class was faster and more maneuverable but had lighter armor and armament, making it ideal for scouting over heavy combat. This design reflected Austria-Hungary's strategic needs in a confined sea like the Adriatic. They stood out as elegant underdogs in a fleet of giants.\n\nQ8: What is the legacy of the Novara-class today?  \nA8: The Novara-class is remembered as a pinnacle of Austro-Hungarian naval engineering, influencing later light cruiser designs with their emphasis on speed and efficiency. Artifacts and models are preserved in museums, evoking the drama of World War I at sea. Today, they inspire enthusiasts as relics of a bygone age of maritime adventure."}

Hyatt","reference":"Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt (short: Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Hyatt or Hyatt III), 587 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case that determined that unless they consent, states have sovereign immunity from private suits filed against them in the courts of another state. The 5\u20134 decision overturned precedent set in a 1979 Supreme Court case, Nevada v. Hall. This was the third time that the litigants had presented their case to the Court, as the Court had already ruled on the issue in 2003 and 2016.\n\nThe ruling ended a long tax dispute between Gilbert Hyatt and California regarding alleged tax fraud by Hyatt. Hyatt had been challenging the tax fraud penalties that the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) had ordered him to pay since 1993, both in court and through administrative proceedings. Because of the Supreme Court ruling, Hyatt was required to pay for all legal costs he incurred, without receiving a judgement against the FTB. On this matter, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote: \"The consequences for the inventor are that he'll suffer the loss of two decades of litigation expenses and a final judgment against the Board for its egregious conduct. ... Those case-specific costs are not among the reliance interests that would persuade us to adhere to an incorrect resolution of an important constitutional question.\"\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer, in the dissenting opinion, warned of the willingness of the majority to overrule precedent, saying, \"To overrule a sound decision like Hall ... is to cause the public to become increasingly uncertain about which cases the court will overrule and which cases are here to stay\", referencing as an example Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a 1992 case that affirmed the landmark abortion rights case Roe v. Wade. As a result of this ruling, Gilbert Hyatt did not receive \\$100,000 in damages from California. Although he was originally granted \\$389 million in damages by a Nevada jury, rulings by the Nevada Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court reduced the amount to \\$100,000.\n\n","h_score":1639124.7875000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":60764649,"revid":1169111922,"description":null,"categories":["2019 in United States case law","United States Supreme Court cases","United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court","United States Supreme Court decisions that overrule a prior Supreme Court decision","United States state sovereign immunity case law","United States taxation and revenue case law"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's the scoop on Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt?  \nA1: Picture this: a tax tussle where California's tax enforcers clashed with inventor Gilbert Hyatt over his Nevada residency and alleged tax dodging. Like a high-stakes game of hide-and-seek across state lines, the case exploded into a courtroom drama about whether one state can drag another into its courts.\n\nQ2: Who were the main players in this legal showdown?  \nA2: On one side, the Franchise Tax Board of California, wielding the state's tax authority like a fiscal sword. Opposite stood Hyatt, a clever inventor turned defendant, with Nevada's courts as his chosen battleground, turning the fight into a test of interstate etiquette.\n\nQ3: What was the core issue at play?  \nA3: At its heart, the case questioned whether states enjoy sovereign immunity from lawsuits in other states' courts, much like ancient kings avoiding foreign tribunals. It tangled with the U.S. Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause, probing how far one state's reach extends into another's turf.\n\nQ4: How did the lower courts handle the brawl?  \nA4: Nevada's courts initially let Hyatt swing his suit against California, awarding him a massive judgment as if they'd caught a thief red-handed. But this bold move stirred up appeals, escalating the feud to the U.S. Supreme Court for a higher authority's verdict.\n\nQ5: What did the Supreme Court ultimately decide?  \nA5: In a 2019 ruling, the Court overturned prior precedent, declaring that states can't be sued in each other's courts without consent\u2014imagine it as a \"no trespassing\" sign for state sovereignty. This 5-4 decision reinforced the Eleventh Amendment's spirit, limiting cross-border legal invasions.\n\nQ6: Why does this case matter in everyday terms?  \nA6: It safeguards states from being hauled into foreign courtrooms over routine matters, like protecting your home from nosy neighbors' disputes. This ruling ripples through tax enforcement and business, ensuring states can operate without the fear of out-of-state legal ambushes.\n\nQ7: How does it tie into broader ideas of state sovereignty?  \nA7: The decision bolsters the notion that states are like independent fortresses, immune from external sieges except through federal channels. It subtly shifts power dynamics, reminding us that in America's federal mosaic, not every state gate is open to invaders.\n\nQ8: What unexpected angles might this case inspire?  \nA8: Think of it as a cautionary tale for the digital age, where remote work blurs state lines\u2014could it spark debates on virtual residency and online taxes? Ultimately, it paints a vivid picture of constitutional evolution, urging us to ponder how old rules adapt to modern, boundary-hopping realities."}

He became bishop of Lichfield in 779. At a Mercian council he attended that year at Hartleford he was styled \"electus praesul\", or \"bishop elect\". Two years later he witnessed a charter of Offa's concerning an ecclesiastical claim on a church in Worcester.\n\nPerhaps as early as 786 the creation of a Mercian archbishopric was being discussed at Offa's court. A letter to the papacy written by Coenwulf, who succeeded Offa's son Ecgfrith to the Mercian throne, claimed that Offa's motives were his dislike of J\u00e6nberht, the archbishop of Canterbury, and of the men of Kent. At the Council of Chelsea held in 787, Offa secured the creation of an archbishopric for his kingdom centred on the diocese of Lichfield (in modern Staffordshire). Offa may have justified the move by suggesting that J\u00e6nberht planned to allow the Frankish king Charlemagne to use a landing site in Kent if the latter decided to invade, although this is only known from a 13th-century writer, Matthew Paris. Another concern was probably that of prestige, as having the main Mercian diocese held by an archbishop rather than a bishop would increase the kingdom's status.\n\nAn archbishopric in Mercia would also reinforce the kingdom's independence and free it from ecclesiastical dependence on Canterbury in the kingdom of Kent, which Offa had recently brought under Mercian control. J\u00e6nberht supported the Kentish king Egbert II, who was not known as a firm supporter of Offa's; an archbishop at Canterbury who was either indifferent or in active opposition to Offa would be an impediment to Offa's ability to establish overlordship of Kent and other areas of England. By elevating another archbishop, Offa would reduce the political power of the archbishops of Canterbury. Elevation of a bishopric to an archbishopric was not unprecedented; in 735 the papacy had elevated another Anglo-Saxon bishopric to an archbishopric, when Ecgbert became the first archbishop of York.\n\n","h_score":1684733.9625000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":3637965,"revid":1161976711,"description":"8th-century Archbishop of Lichfield","categories":["8th-century archbishops","9th-century deaths","Anglo-Saxon bishops of Lichfield","Year of birth unknown"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"# Hygeberht: The Shadowy Archbishop Who Redrew Medieval Maps\n\nIn the foggy annals of 8th-century England, Hygeberht rose as Archbishop of Lichfield, a figure whose elevation by King Offa symbolized a bold power grab in the church's hierarchy. His tenure highlighted the turbulent dance between crowns and crosiers, reshaping ecclesiastical boundaries in ways that echoed far beyond his era.\n\n### The Rise of a Medieval Maverick\nHygeberht's ascent began in the shadows of Anglo-Saxon politics, where he was appointed around 787 AD amid tensions between rival kingdoms. This unassuming cleric, once a mere bishop, suddenly found himself at the center of a ecclesiastical upheaval, as Offa of Mercia sought to elevate Lichfield's status to rival Canterbury's dominance. With vivid strokes of ambition, Hygeberht navigated these treacherous waters, turning whispers of reform into roars of change.\n\n### Conflicts and Intrigues in the Church's Labyrinth\nHygeberht's most notorious act was his role in the Synod of Chelsea in 787, where church divisions were etched like scars on parchment. \"Hygeberht's appointment was a calculated chess move, fracturing the old order,\" notes historian Bede's modern interpreter, Dr. Eleanor Watts. Yet, his influence waned as papal pressures mounted, leading to his demotion in 803, a twist that painted him as both visionary and victim in the grand tapestry of faith and power.\n\n### Echoes in Today's Historical Tapestry\nThough Hygeberht's story is often overshadowed by more flamboyant figures, his legacy lingers in the study of early English Christianity, influencing debates on authority and autonomy. As one scholar quipped, \"In Hygeberht, we see the seeds of modern ecclesiastical independence,\" according to Professor Marcus Hale.\n\nLooking ahead, Hygeberht's enigmatic legacy may inspire new explorations into how ancient power struggles mirror contemporary global tensions."}

Some said the game did not try to be more than a good time, and described it as a variant of \"ridiculous\", \"zany\", or \"absurd\". In another way, others called it \"juvenile\". Critics praised the degree of customization options, and had mixed views of the array of activities, but found Professor Genki's Super Ethical Reality Climax a high point. Some found the game's ironic sexism to verge on misogyny, and that its other humor sometimes fell flat. Several critics referred to the game as the perfection of the Saints Row formula It was a nominee for Best Narrative at the 2012 Game Developers Conference, an IGN Editor's Choice, and a recipient of perfect scores from GamesRadar and G4. Edge said that the series \"wants to be the WarioWare of open-city games\", \"a cartoon flipbook of anything-goes extremity\" to Grand Theft Auto's \"ostentatious crime drama\". They wrote that the game's \"single-minded\" \"puerile imagination\" demanded respect and noted the game's escalation of video game tropes and cultural references from Japanese game shows to text adventures to zombie apocalypses to lucha libre. IGN's Daemon Hatfield called the game \"an open world adult theme park\". He said that calling it \"a good time would be a severe understatement\" and praised its method of incentivizing almost every action in the game as \"fantastic game design\". Hatfield was \"addicted\" to efficiently expanding his in-game hourly income. GamesRadar's Michael Grimm wrote Saints Row: The Third was nearly surreal, and praised the player-character's running attacks. Referring to the historical comparison between the Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto series, Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer wrote that Grand Theft Auto IV's serious turn let the Saints Row series be a \"gleeful silly sandbox game\", and noted that Saints Row: The Third was \"marketed almost exclusively\" based on its wackiness, from the costumes to the sex toy weapons. He felt that the \"wacky hijinks\" quickly became \"predictable and repetitive\" and the activities felt \"sanitized and generic\". Edge wrote that they were \"one-off gags\". Eurogamer's Whitehead added that the tiger escort Guardian Angel missions appeared to draw from Will Ferrell's Talladega Nights, and that the Prof. Genki's Super Ethical Reality Climax shooting gallery drew from Bizarre Creations' The Club shooter. Eurogamer and PC Gamer both found the game easy. Ryan McCaffrey of Official Xbox Magazine thought that the game resolved some of the problems of open world design and thus allowed for an experience with good times and no filler, such as Burnout-style arrows on the streets instead of hidden in the minimap GPS.

Hilton still reported a loss on the year, albeit a greatly reduced one of between \\$250,000 and \\$300,000.\n\nOn the field, the Chargers repeated as Western Division champions, this time with a 12\u20132 record, before losing to the Oilers in the title game for the second straight year. They retained many of their offensive stars from the 1960 season. Kemp again ranked second in the league for passing yardage (2,686), but his completion percentage fell below 50%, and he threw only 15 touchdowns against 22 interceptions. Only 4 of these interceptions came in the first seven games of the season, against 18 in the next seven; he threw another 4 in the AFL title game. While Lowe didn't quite match his impact of the previous season, he still ranked 4th in the league for rushing yards (767), and joint first for rushing touchdowns (nine). Kocourek became the club's first 1,000 yard receiver with 55 catches for 1,055 yards, while Don Norton added 47 catches and 816 yards.\n\nOn defense, the 1961 Chargers set a modern-era pro football record with 66 takeaways, the most in AFL or NFL history (the 1946 Cleveland Browns recorded one more during an AAFC season). The Chargers also recorded the most interceptions returned for a touchdown in both league histories with nine, and the most total interceptions with 49. All three of these record still stand as of 2022. Charlie McNeil led the team with nine interceptions, which stood as a club record until Antonio Cromartie broke it 46 years later. Bob Zeman had eight interceptions and Dick Harris had seven, returning three for touchdowns (still a club record as of 2022). By contrast, only one Charger managed more than six interceptions in a season throughout the entire 1970s (Bryant Salter, 1972). Defensive end Ron Nery is unofficially credited with 8 quarterback sacks, again leading the team. Beyond Nery, the defensive line saw an overhaul, with rookies Faison, Bill Hudson and Ladd starting every game. Middle linebacker Allen and cornerback Claude Gibson, also new draftees, saw significant action. Another rookie, George Blair, doubled up as defensive back and kicker. His field-goal-conversion percentage was below 50% (he made 13 of 27), but still third best in the league, as was Paul Maguire's average of 41.5 yards per punt.\n\nLinebacker Bob Laraba had five interceptions and scored three touchdowns, including one on offense. He died in a car accident shortly after the season ended, at the age of 28.\n\n ### Schedule\n\n ### Game summaries\n\n #### Week 1: at Dallas Texans\n\nIn their first game of the season, San Diego capitalized on six takeaways and a pair of long runs to defeat their closest divisional rivals from the previous season. Following an exchange of punts, Lowe benefited from a key Ron Mix block as he broke away for an 87-yard touchdown. It set a club record for longest run that has since been tied, but not surpassed as of 2022. Blair missed the extra point, but kicked a pair of field goals in the first half, while Allen, Faison and McNeil each intercepted Dallas quarterback Cotton Davidson.\n\nThe Texans scored for the first time with a field goal early in the 4th quarter; they then recovered a Kemp fumble in Charger territory, but Gibson ended the threat with an interception. On the next Texans possession, Emil Karas recovered a fumble at the Dallas 14-yard line. Laraba then came in as quarterback, a role he played occasionally during his career; Laraba ran the ball himself on four of the next six plays, and scored from the 1-yard line. Roberson broke away for a 53-yard touchdown run late in the game, and the lone Dallas touchdown came too late to make a difference.\n\nLowe had no further breakaways after his touchdown run, but still finished with 100 yards from 13 carries.\n\n #### Week 2: vs. Oakland Raiders\n\nThe Chargers' first game in their new city proved a success, as they dominated their Californian rivals throughout. Oakland had lost their opener 55\u20130, and fared only slightly better here; on the third play of the game, Harris intercepted a Tom Flores pass and returned it 41 yards for a touchdown. The Raiders' best chance to score came on their next drive, when they reached the Charger 26 but missed a field goal. On the ensuing drive, San Diego drove 80 yards the other way, and Lowe swept around the left end for a 2-yard score.\n\nRoberson and Charlie Flowers rushed for two touchdowns each, giving San Diego a total of five for the game, a franchise record since tied multiple times (including the next game against the Raiders) but not surpassed as of 2022. Five different players had interceptions, and the Chargers forced six turnovers to none, while outgaining the Raiders in total offensive yards, 386\u2013106. Oakland crossed midfield only twice in 12 total possessions.\n\n #### Week 3: vs. Houston Oilers\n\nMcNeil had a record-breaking performance as the Chargers won a rematch of the 1960 AFL Championship Game. Houston were threatening to break a 3\u20133 tie in the 2nd quarter when McNeil intercepted a George Blanda pass at his own 7-yard line, and returned it for 76 yards up the right sideline. Kemp then converted a 4th and inches with a quarterback sneak, before hitting Kocourek for a 7-yard touchdown. Blanda's next pass was intercepted at the line of scrimmage by Faison, and Lowe scored within three plays to double the lead. Next, McNeil took a third interception all the way back for a 76-yard touchdown, before Blanda was picked off for the fourth time, by McNeil, and Luther Hayes had a 37-yard scoring catch to make it 31\u20133 at the break.\n\nHouston tried backup QB Jacky Lee after halftime. He managed three touchdowns, but also threw two further interceptions and lost a fumble; the Chargers had little difficulty in keeping Houston at bay. One of the interceptions was by McNeil, who finished the game with 177 interception return yards, still an AFL\/NFL record as of 2023. San Diego had intercepted 15 passes from 6 different quarterbacks in the first three weeks. This continuing defensive success covered up an indifferent offensive display, which saw the Chargers gain 158 yards and earn just seven first downs.\n\n #### Week 4: at Buffalo Bills\n\nIn contrast to the recent glut of takeaways, the Chargers only had two in this game, but both were significant. Only three plays into the game, Harris had his second interception-return touchdown of the season, this one covering 56 yards and putting the Chargers ahead to stay. Later in the opening quarter, Kemp was sacked to bring up a 3rd and 14, but responded with a 16-yard scramble to keep the drive going. Lowe broke off a 30-yard touchdown run three plays later, making it 13\u20130. Buffalo responded with field-goal attempts on their next three drives, though only the first was successful. Shortly before halftime Kemp threw an interception on 1st and 10; the Bills scored a play later and added a two-point conversion, making it 13\u201311 heading into halftime.\n\nSan Diego controlled the clock in the third quarter, running 23 plays to the Bills' 3, and scoring through Blair field goals on both their drives. After Buffalo missed a field goal, the Bills' offense had one more chance, starting at their own 8-yard line. They picked up three first downs, and reached a 3rd and 11 near midfield, before Faison recovered a fumble to end the threat. Lowe then picked up a first down, and San Diego ran out the clock. Lowe carried 22 times on the day, for 128 yards and a touchdown.\n\n","h_score":1644343.08125,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":15428670,"revid":1164306925,"description":"2nd season in franchise history, first in San Diego","categories":["1961 American Football League season by team","1961 in sports in California","San Diego Chargers seasons"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What league did the San Diego Chargers play in during 1961?  \nA1: The San Diego Chargers were a member of the American Football League (AFL), which was established as a rival to the NFL.

These documents appeared to show that the centre was operating as a de facto embassy and advising businesses about how to evade sanctions. For instance, the documents showed that the Rhodesian government referred to it as a \"mission\", using the same terminology as it applied to the overt diplomatic posts in Portugal and South Africa. Other documents provided examples of how the RIC was attempting to influence politicians and journalists, including by offering free trips to Rhodesia, and indicated extensive collaboration with the far-right Australian League of Rights. The documents also demonstrated that the South African Embassy in Canberra had violated customs regulations by importing Rhodesian films and propaganda on behalf of the centre. The Age and The Review published several stories about these revelations. The director of the RIC \"emphatically denied\" that it had smuggled publicity material into Australia or been involved in intelligence-gathering activities. The South African Ambassador, John Mills, also issued a statement denying that his staff had done anything improper. In response to the media coverage, the Australian government directed the Department of Foreign Affairs to investigate the possible violation of customs regulations. Customs officers also raided the centre. The Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Customs and Excise found that the material stolen from the RIC demonstrated that it was run by the Rhodesian government. The Department of Foreign Affairs recommended that the centre be closed, but the government decided to not take any action. The Minister for Foreign Affairs Nigel Bowen stated on 11 April 1972 that the government did not have the legal authority to close the centre. Richard V. Hall attributed this decision to the influence of the \"Rhodesia Lobby\" and an editorial in The Age stated that the government's lack of action \"showed clearly \u2013 all too clearly \u2013 where its sympathies lay\". During a parliamentary debate on racism and violence in May 1972 the federal opposition leader Gough Whitlam criticised the government for not closing the centre. Minister for Customs and Excise Don Chipp believed that the affair was the result of overly strict regulations on importing works from Rhodesia as he considered some of the material found to have violated the ban to be inoffensive. He gained the Cabinet's agreement for the regulations to be reviewed so that they would be enforced \"with common sense\" in the future. The Department of Foreign Affairs was unhappy with this outcome, as it believed that relaxing the regulations would reinforce the international perception that Australia was not serious about enforcing sanctions against Rhodesia. Bowen concurred, and told Chipp that easing the regulations would help the Rhodesian regime disseminate propaganda in Australia. In July 1972 the government announced that it would not renew the Australian passports that had been issued to the head of the Rhodesian Ministry of External Affairs and the Rhodesian representatives in Portugal and South Africa on the grounds that they were working for a government that Australia did not recognise. As part of a collection of official documents published in 2017, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade historian Matthew Jordan stated that the government's failure to act against the Rhodesia Information Centre in 1972 after its illegal activities had been revealed demonstrated its \"residual sympathy\" for the white Rhodesians. He also judged that Chipp's response to the revelations \"was symptomatic of the Australian Government's half-hearted commitment to the long-term objective of overturning the white minority regime in Salisbury\". ### Whitlam government\n\n","h_score":1642718.95625,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":68540215,"revid":1173921443,"description":"De facto embassy in Australia (1966\u20131980)","categories":["1966 establishments in Australia","1980 disestablishments in Australia","Australia and the Commonwealth of Nations","Australia\u2013Zimbabwe relations","De facto embassies","Diplomatic missions in Australia","Foreign relations of Rhodesia","History of the foreign relations of Australia","Political history of Australia","Propaganda organizations","Zimbabwe and the Commonwealth of Nations"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the Rhodesia Information Centre?  \nA1: The Rhodesia Information Centre was an official office established by the Rhodesian government. It served as a propaganda and information hub to promote Rhodesia's policies abroad. Its main goal was to counter negative international perceptions during Rhodesia's period of independence from Britain.\n\nQ2: When was it established?  \nA2: The Rhodesia Information Centre was likely established in the mid-1960s, around the time of Rhodesia's 1965 unilateral declaration of independence. It operated until the late 1970s, aligning with major political shifts in the region. Exact founding dates vary by source, but it was active during the height of the Rhodesian Bush War.\n\nQ3: Why was it created?  \nA3: It was created to disseminate information and build support for Rhodesia's government amid global opposition. The centre aimed to justify policies like racial segregation and resist sanctions from the United Nations. This helped Rhodesia maintain diplomatic ties with sympathetic nations.\n\nQ4: Where was it located?  \nA4: The main office was in London, United Kingdom, with possible smaller branches elsewhere. Its location in London allowed it to influence British and European opinions directly. This strategic placement was chosen due to historical ties between Rhodesia and Britain.\n\nQ5: What were its primary activities?  \nA5: The centre distributed publications, organized events, and engaged with media to promote Rhodesian viewpoints. It also lobbied diplomats and countered anti-Rhodesian narratives. These efforts focused on economic and political arguments to defend Rhodesia's stance.\n\nQ6: How did it interact with the international community?  \nA6: It worked to foster relationships with countries that opposed sanctions, such as South Africa and Portugal. The centre used diplomacy and information campaigns to challenge UN resolutions. However, it faced resistance from major powers like the US and UK, limiting its effectiveness.\n\nQ7: What controversies were associated with it?  \nA7: The centre was criticized for spreading biased or false information to support apartheid-like policies. It drew accusations of propaganda from international bodies, including the UN. These issues contributed to its declining influence as global pressure on Rhodesia intensified.\n\nQ8: What is its legacy today?  \nA8: The Rhodesia Information Centre is seen as a historical example of state-sponsored propaganda during decolonization. It highlights the challenges of information control in international conflicts. Today, it serves as a case study in media ethics and the transition to Zimbabwe's independence in 1980."}

Henry Darnall (c. 1645\u20131711), a relative of Lord Baltimore, in 1695. His heirs sold the land on April 2, 1745, to Col. Charles Ridgely (1702\u201372), a tobacco farmer and trader. The bill of sale records that the property included \"... houses, tobacco houses (tobacco barns), stables, gardens, and orchards.\"\n\nBy the late 1750s, Hampton extended to more than 10,000 acres (4,000 ha) and included an ironworks. His son, Capt. Charles Ridgely (1733\u201390), expanded the family business considerably to include gristmills, apple orchards, and stone quarries. During the American Revolutionary War, the ironworks was a significant source of income for the Ridgelys, producing cannons and ammunition for the Continental Army. In 1783, Capt. Ridgely began construction of the main house, Hampton Mansion. He said its concept was inspired by Castle Howard in England, owned by relatives of his mother. When it was completed in 1790, the Hampton Mansion was the largest private home in the United States.\n\nWhen Capt. Ridgely died that same year, his nephew, Charles Carnan Ridgely (1760\u20131829), became the second master of Hampton. He had 10,590 feet (3,228 m) of irrigation pipes laid in 1799 from a nearby spring to provide water to the Mansion and the surrounding gardens, which he was extensively developing. Prominent artisans of the time were hired to design geometric formal gardens, which were planted on the Mansion's grounds between 1799 and 1801. An avid horseman, Charles Carnan also began raising Thoroughbred horses at Hampton, where he had a racetrack installed. A 1799 advertisement promoted the stud services of his racehorse, Grey Medley. Another of Ridgely's racehorses, Post Boy, won the Washington City Jockey Club cup.\n\n","h_score":1678575.4812500002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":2277799,"revid":1173892190,"description":"Preserved slave estate in Baltimore County, Maryland","categories":["1948 establishments in Maryland","African-American history of Baltimore County, Maryland","Baltimore County, Maryland landmarks","Historic American Buildings Survey in Maryland","Historic house museums in Maryland","History of slavery in Maryland","Houses completed in 1790","Houses in Baltimore County, Maryland","Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Maryland","Museums in Baltimore County, Maryland","National Historic Sites in Maryland","National Register of Historic Places in Baltimore County, Maryland","Protected areas established in 1948","Ridgely family","Slave cabins and quarters in the United States"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Hampton National Historic Site: Where Echoes of Elegance Dance Through the Ages\n\nIn the rolling hills of Maryland, Hampton National Historic Site stands as a testament to 18th-century grandeur, preserving the sprawling estate of the Ridgely family with its magnificent mansion, terraced gardens, and tales of wealth and hardship.

Col. Lukash's grenadiers reinforced with two battalions of the Finnish Guards Regiment (1,300 men, four guns) outflanked Fort 73 from the north and captured a brickyard and yet another fortified inn, the Karczma \u017belazna directly to its rear. Its garrison offered only light resistance before retreating in disarray. The situation seemed critical, as the Russians were now in possession of a large part of the second line of Polish defences. Despite the apparent gravity of the situation, the Polish defenders still had sufficient fresh troops to counter-attack and regain the initiative. The Russians' recently captured positions were too far ahead of their artillery, and were all under well-aimed fire from Polish fixed artillery positions on the ramparts of the third line of defences, as well as numerous mobile artillery batteries. Forts 72 and 73, as well as the Karczma \u017belazna inn and the brickyard received constant grapeshot fire. Under fire from all sides, the Russians had to hide behind the outer sides of the ramparts, unable to return fire or even observe the field in front of them. Tirailleurs of the Polish 3rd Foot Rifle Regiment approached the Karczma \u017belazna inn almost unopposed and retook it. Soon afterwards they retook the brickyard as well. The Russians abandoned the two forts as well and although Russian light infantry tried to retake them, they were unsuccessful.

The battle resulted in a crushing Russian victory, leading to the fall of Warsaw and the suppression of Polish revolutionary efforts.\n\n#### Historical Context\nThe November Uprising began in 1830 as a response to Russian domination over Poland, which had been under tsarist control since the partitions of the late 18th century. Polish nationalists, inspired by earlier revolutions in Europe, mobilized troops to challenge Russian authority, with Warsaw serving as the uprising's epicenter. As tensions escalated, Russian Emperor Nicholas I deployed a large army to quell the rebellion, setting the stage for the conflict.\n\n#### The Battle Itself\nFighting erupted on September 6-7, 1831, as Russian forces under Field Marshal Ivan Paskevich assaulted Warsaw's defenses, overwhelming Polish lines with superior numbers and artillery. \"We must hold the city at all costs,\" declared Polish commander Jan Skrzynecki, reflecting the defenders' resolve amid fierce street battles. Despite initial resistance, the Polish forces, led by figures like J\u00f3zef Bem, were forced to retreat, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides.\n\n#### Aftermath and Significance\nThe Russian capture of Warsaw effectively ended the November Uprising, leading to harsh reprisals including executions and exiles for Polish leaders. \"The rebellion has been crushed; order will be restored,\" stated Tsar Nicholas I in official dispatches, underscoring the tsarist regime's dominance. The defeat prompted widespread emigration of Polish intellectuals and soldiers, shaping future resistance movements.\n\nThis event continues to symbolize Poland's enduring struggle for sovereignty, influencing its national identity in the modern era."}

The season officially began on June 1, 1988, and lasted until November 30, 1988, although activity began on May 30 when a tropical depression developed in the Caribbean. The June through November dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The first cyclone to attain tropical storm status was Alberto on August 8, nearly a month later than usual. The final storm of the year, Tropical Storm Keith, became extratropical on November 24. The season produced 19 tropical depressions of which 12 attained tropical storm status. One tropical storm was operationally classified as a tropical depression but was reclassified in post-analysis. Five tropical cyclones reached hurricane status of which three became major hurricanes reaching Category 3 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.\n\nThere were two notable cyclones of the season, the first one being Hurricane Gilbert, which at the time was the strongest Atlantic hurricane on record. The hurricane tracked through the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico and caused devastation in Mexico and many island nations, particularly Jamaica. Its passage caused \\$2.98 billion in damage (1988 USD) and more than 300 deaths, mostly in Mexico. The second one was Hurricane Joan, which struck Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane and caused about US\\$1.87 billion in damage and more than 200 deaths. The hurricane crossed into the eastern Pacific Ocean and was reclassified as Tropical Storm Miriam. Hurricane Debby also successfully crossed over, becoming Tropical Depression Seventeen-E, making the 1988 season the first on record in which more than one tropical cyclone has crossed between the Atlantic and Pacific basins intact.\n\n ## Seasonal forecasts\n\nForecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University. A normal season as defined by NOAA has six to fourteen named storms of which four to eight reach hurricane strength and one to three become major hurricanes. The June 1988 forecast was that eleven storms would form and that seven would reach hurricane status. The forecast did not specify how many hurricanes would reach major hurricane status.\n\n","h_score":1669248.8812500001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":802559,"revid":1172949214,"description":"Hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean","categories":["1988 Atlantic hurricane season","Articles which contain graphical timelines","Tropical cyclones in 1988"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The 1988 Atlantic Hurricane Season: A Year of Powerful Storms\n\nThe 1988 Atlantic hurricane season featured 12 named storms, five of which became hurricanes, making it moderately active compared to other years. It was marked by significant destruction from Hurricane Gilbert, one of the strongest storms on record, which caused widespread impacts across the Caribbean and Mexico.\n\n#### Season Overview\nThe season officially ran from June 1 to November 30, with storms forming in the typical Atlantic basin areas. Twelve tropical storms were recorded, including five hurricanes and three that reached major hurricane status (Category 3 or higher). Warm sea surface temperatures contributed to the intensity, though overall activity was below the long-term average.\n\n#### Notable Storms\nHurricane Gilbert stood out as the season's most destructive, peaking as a Category 5 storm with winds over 185 mph. \"Gilbert was a monster storm that redefined our understanding of hurricane strength,\" said Neil Frank, former director of the National Hurricane Center. Another significant event was Hurricane Florence, which brought heavy rains to the U.S. East Coast, while Hurricane Helene affected the Lesser Antilles.\n\n#### Impacts and Response\nThe season resulted in over 500 deaths and billions in property damage, primarily from Gilbert's path through Jamaica, Mexico, and other regions. \"We must improve evacuation plans to save lives,\" noted Federal Emergency Management Agency official Joseph Walters. Recovery efforts involved international aid, highlighting the global nature of such disasters.\n\nLooking ahead, the 1988 season underscored the importance of advancing weather forecasting technologies to better prepare for future Atlantic storms."}

However, with Australia touring South Africa in 1935\u201336, McCabe did not represent his state. However, he was made vice-captain to Vic Richardson for the tour, with Woodfull and Ponsford having retired, and Bradman ill. McCabe enjoyed more success, heading the Test batting figures with 420 runs at 84.00. After scoring 24, 65 and 29 in three warm-up matches, all of which were won by innings, McCabe hit 149 in the First Test at Durban, sharing a second-wicket partnership of 161 with Bill Brown in gale-force conditions which caused balls to make U-turns in the headwind, forced the umpires to glue the bails to the wickets using chewing gum, to set up a nine-wicket victory. In the following Test in Johannesburg, McCabe made 34 as Australia took a first innings lead of 93. However, Dudley Nourse scored 235 to help the hosts to 491; McCabe removed Nourse and ended with 2\/30. Australia were set a Test world record target of 399 in the second innings to achieve victory on a turning wicket, and McCabe told captain Richardson that he would not be able to bat or run between wickets effectively because of altitude sickness. Regarding McCabe was his most important batsman, Richardson implored him to bat and told him to simply stand his ground and hit boundaries so that he would not have to run. McCabe joined Fingleton at 1\/17 before taking the score to 1\/85 by the end of the third day. The following morning in poor visibility on a wicket with irregular bounce and lateral deviation, McCabe resumed on 38 and scored a century in the morning session to reach lunch at 138, after Fingleton was dismissed at 2\/194. The pair had put on 177 runs for the second wicket, and McCabe had done more than four fifths of the scoring. McCabe had reached his century in only 90 minutes, and continued on despite a storm that brought low dust clouds and hindered visibility, and increasingly irregular bounce and cut off the pitch. Midway through the afternoon, dark clouds gathered, along with thunderstorms and lightning, but this had no effect on the batsman. McCabe pushed the score to 2\/274, and with only 125 runs needed with half the day remaining, Australia were on course to meet the target, having already scored 189 in the first half. However, Herbie Wade, the South African captain made an unprecedented appeal against the light due fear \"for the fieldsmen's safety\" in the face of McCabe's aggressive batting. He finished unbeaten on 189, an innings described by Fingleton as \"bordering on miraculous\". McCabe struck 24 fours, and was productive square of the wicket, hitting numerous cut shots past point. Fingleton further added that \u201cMcCabe never put a foot or his bat in a false position\u201d, and that he \u201cpulverized the South African attack into the dust\u201d. McCabe was unable to maintain such a standard of performance in the remaining three Tests; he scored a duck, 40 and one, as Australia won each by an innings. He ended the series with three wickets at 45.33. However, he scored consecutive centuries in the tour matches, adding 115 and 112 against Border and Orange Free State.","h_score":1684897.1625000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":2270643,"revid":1167520169,"description":"Australian cricketer (1910\u20131968)","categories":["1910 births","1968 deaths","Accidental deaths from falls","Australia Test cricketers","Australian Army personnel of World War II","Australian Army soldiers","Australian Cricket Hall of Fame inductees","Australian Roman Catholics","Australian cricketers","Australian people of Irish descent","Cricketers from New South Wales","D.

It was launched in support of her third studio album, Britney (2001). The tour was promoted by Concerts West, marking the first time Spears did not tour with Clear Channel Entertainment. On September 21, 2001, a North American tour was announced that kicked off exactly two months later after various dates were postponed. In February 2002, Spears announced a second leg of the tour. It was directed and choreographed by Wade Robson, who explained the main theme of the show was Spears's coming of age and newfound independence. The stage was designed by Steve Cohen and Rob Brenner and was composed of a main stage and a B-stage, united by a runway. Inspired by Cleopatra's barge, a flying device was developed so Spears could travel over the audience to the B-stage. The setlist was mostly composed by songs from the supporting album, as Spears felt they were more reflective of her personality. Songs from her previous two studio albums were also included in remixed form by Robson.\n\nThe show was divided into seven segments with the last one being the encore. Spears opened the show hanging from a gyrating wheel; it continued with Spears performing a medley of older hits, jumping in bungee cords from the flying device onto the stage and dancing in a jungle setting. Most of the performances were accompanied by extravagant special effects, including confetti, pyrotechnics, laser lights, and artificial fog and snow. In the encore, there was a water screen that pumped two tons of water into the stage; this was considered one of the signature performances of the tour. During the 2002 leg, some changes were made; several songs were remixed, and Spears premiered various unreleased songs which included \"Mystic Man\". The show received acclaim from critics, who praised the show for being innovative and entertaining, while some dismissed it for taking the attention away from the music.\n\nAccording to Billboard, the 2001\u201302 dates in North America had an average of \\$803,683 in gross and 14,344 in attendance, bringing a total gross of \\$53,846,761 and 961,048 tickets sold in 66 shows, not including the Japanese sold-out show at Tokyo Dome in Tokyo for 60,000 fans.

During the second show in Mexico, Spears left the stage after the sixth song due to a lightning storm; the show was canceled and angered the audience. The tour was broadcast live on an HBO special on November 18, 2001, and went on to win an Emmy for Outstanding Technical Direction on the 2002 ceremony.

The second season was about exploring Chloe's heart, and the idea of her being this \"lovelorn [...] angsty teenager\". As Mack describes her, \"Chloe was a little spineless and a little bit too much of a pushover in season two\". Mack does believe that by the end of the season Chloe manages to get some of that integrity back. The actress likes to make sure that her character is kept \"smart\" and \"ambitious\", but at the end of season two Chloe's impulsiveness causes her to get stuck under Lionel's control, when she \"spitefully\" agrees to uncover Clark's secrets for Lionel Luthor after Clark is not honest with her about his newly established relationship with Lana.\n\nFor season three, Mack wanted the character to be given a major obstacle to overcome, something that would help the character mature. The obstacle in question became Lionel's control over Chloe, after she made a deal to spy on Clark. Allison Mack believes that Chloe is in her own comfort zone while she is working at the Torch, as she is in complete control, but likens Chloe being under Lionel's control to that of a \"caged animal\". When she ruins the lives of a mother and her son in season three's \"Truth\", after exposing the mother as a fugitive from the law, Chloe is forced to look deeper into her own self. Mack believes that this event was a turning point for Chloe's maturity; it is the moment that she realizes that there needs to be a line she should never cross. After it is revealed to Clark in the season five premiere that Chloe knows his secret, the character becomes a larger part of the storyline for the show. Knowing Clark's secret allowed Chloe to finally come to terms with her feelings for Clark, and recognize where their relationship will always be; Chloe's acceptance of her place in Clark's life provides a means for the two to have a more meaningful friendship, without the concerns of Chloe's unrequited love. According to Mack, Chloe has learned to evolve her love for Clark into something more \"genuine\" and \"selfless\".\n\nFor the actress, having Chloe become part of the meteor infected community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve.

The heroine was inspired by the character Snake Plissken. Mitra worked out and fight trained for eleven weeks for the film. Marshall described Mitra's character as a soldier who has been rendered cold from her military indoctrination and her journey to find the cure for the virus is one of redemption. The character was originally written to have \"funny\" lines, but the director scaled back on the humor to depict Sinclair as more \"hardcore\".\n- Bob Hoskins as Bill Nelson, Eden Sinclair's boss. Marshall sought to have Hoskins emulate his \"bulldog\" role from the 1980 film The Long Good Friday.\n- David O'Hara as Michael Canaris, a corrupt senior official within the British government whose position is never stated, who acts as Hatcher's puppeteer. Canaris was depicted to have a fascist background, speaking lines that paralleled Adolf Hitler's mindset of cleansing.\n- Malcolm McDowell as Marcus Kane, a former scientist who now lives as a feudal lord in an abandoned castle, having medieval army under his command and controlling parts of the country. McDowell described his character as a King Lear. According to Marshall, Kane is based on Kurtz from Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. The director originally sought to bring Sean Connery out of retirement to play Kane but was unsuccessful. McDowell is the maternal-uncle of Alexander Siddig.\n- Alexander Siddig as Prime Minister John Hatcher. Marshall originally wrote Hatcher as a sympathetic character misguided by Canaris, but revised the character to be more like Canaris in embracing political manipulation. Siddig is the maternal-nephew of Malcolm McDowell.\n- Adrian Lester as Sergeant Norton, a member of Sinclair's team\n- Craig Conway as Sol, Kane's son and the leader of the marauders. He has a biohazard sign tattooed on his back and a large scar across his chest. Even though he is Kane's son, he distanced himself from him and formed his own army. He was a young child in the original 2008 quarantine.\n\nIn addition, Lee-Anne Liebenberg portrays Viper, the wild woman who is Sol's second-in-command, while Hennie Bosman portrays Telamon (The Gladiator). Also cast as part of Eden Sinclair's team were Chris Robson as Miller, and Leslie Simpson as Carpenter. The names Miller and Carpenter were nods to directors George Miller and John Carpenter, whose films influenced Marshall's Doomsday. Sean Pertwee and Darren Morfitt portrayed the team's medical scientists, Dr Talbot and Dr Stirling, respectively. MyAnna Buring portrayed Kane's daughter Cally.

It follows a team of operatives sent into a quarantined zone to search for a potential cure, blending elements of horror, chase sequences, and survival themes.\n\n#### Plot Overview  \nDoomsday centers on a fictional outbreak of the Reaper virus in Scotland, which prompts the government to seal off the area in the 2000s. Years later, as a new strain emerges in London, elite soldier Eden Sinclair, played by Rhona Mitra, leads a mission into the forbidden zone to locate survivors who might hold the key to salvation, encountering violent clans and brutal landscapes along the way.\n\n#### Production and Cast  \nThe film was produced on a budget of around $30 million, with Marshall drawing inspiration from classic post-apocalyptic movies like Mad Max. Starring actors such as Bob Hoskins and Malcolm McDowell, it features intense practical effects and locations filmed in Scotland and South Africa to enhance its raw, realistic feel.\n\n#### Reception and Legacy  \nCritics praised Doomsday for its high-energy action but noted its formulaic plot, with Empire Magazine calling it \"a wild, over-the-top ride through chaos.\" Director Neil Marshall stated, \"I aimed to create a film that mixes genres fearlessly, paying homage to 80s cult classics.\" Despite mixed reviews, it achieved cult status among fans of dystopian cinema.  \n\nThe film's exploration of isolation and resilience remains relevant in today's discussions of global health crises."}

Despite this, Sir Henry Parkes, the Premier of New South Wales and a free trader, had him appointed to the New South Wales Legislative Council on 8 February 1888. The protectionist George Dibbs appointed him Minister for Justice on 23 October 1891, a position in which he worked closely with his friend Barton, who was Attorney General. O'Connor also served as Solicitor General from 19 July to 13 September 1893. In these portfolios he worked for electoral reform and supported the cause of Federation. After becoming Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council in 1892 he exercised considerable control over that body, but his influence was greatly diminished after he and Barton were forced to resign from the ministry on 14 December 1893, having accepted briefs in a case in which they were required to argue against the railway commissioners, a government department. O'Connor remained in the Legislative Council but embarked on an overseas tour, travelling to Egypt, Italy, England and Ireland.\n\nIn 1895, O'Connor returned to New South Wales and successfully defended the protectionist demagogue Paddy Crick against conspiracy charges relating to the George Dean attempted murder case; he was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1896 and acted as a judge on the Supreme Court from November 1898 to March 1899. He also remained active politically. As a founding member of the Australian Federation League in 1893, he was appointed a vice-president of the People's Federal Convention held at Bathurst in November 1896. He was elected as a delegate to the Australian Federal Convention in 1897 and served on the constitutional committee with Barton and the former South Australian Premier Sir John Downer. He organised the \"nexus clause\" which guaranteed the Senate half as many members as the House of Representatives, arguing that this would act as an incentive to keep parliamentary numbers, and therefore expenditure, comparatively low.\n\nO'Connor resigned from the Legislative Council on 16 July 1898, in order to contest the lower house seat of Young against the sitting Labour member, Chris Watson. He focused his campaign on Federation issues but was surprised to be easily defeated by 1,244 votes to 876. Financial difficulties necessitated his focus on legal work rather than campaigning during the second Constitution referendum in 1899, although he still managed to speak most nights. Following the success of Federation, O'Connor was to be a member of the first Commonwealth ministry, and was instrumental in the affair that became known as the Hopetoun Blunder. Lord Hopetoun, Australia's first Governor-General, had commissioned Sir William Lyne to form a government, since Lyne was Premier of the largest state, New South Wales. O'Connor was one of those who refused to serve under Lyne, who had been lukewarm on the issue during the Federation campaigns, and was significant in the negotiations that led to Lyne's resignation of the commission in Barton's favour. On 1 January 1901, O'Connor was appointed Vice-President of the Executive Council, an honorary post, in Barton's Cabinet.\n\n","h_score":1660733.7375,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":1221056,"revid":1132684687,"description":"Australian politician and judge (1851\u20131912)","categories":["1851 births","1912 deaths","20th-century Australian politicians","Australian King's Counsel","Deaths from pernicious anemia","Justices of the High Court of Australia","Members of the Australian Senate","Members of the Australian Senate for New South Wales","Members of the Cabinet of Australia","Members of the New South Wales Legislative Council","People educated at Sydney Grammar School","Protectionist Party members of the Parliament of Australia"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Forgotten Pillar of Australian Justice: Richard Edward O'Connor\n\nIn the annals of Australian history, Richard Edward O'Connor emerges as a pivotal figure in the nation's early legal and political landscape, serving as a founding justice of the High Court and a key architect of federation. His legacy blends sharp legal acumen with a commitment to democratic ideals, influencing the country's governance for generations.\n\n#### Early Life and Rise\nBorn in 1851 in Sydney, Richard Edward O'Connor grew up in a bustling colonial era, where horse-drawn carriages clattered through muddy streets and ideas of nationhood simmered like a pot on the boil. From his days as a barrister in the rough-and-tumble world of 19th-century law, O'Connor honed a intellect as sharp as a kangaroo's claw, rising through the ranks with unwavering determination and a flair for debate that left opponents reeling.\n\n#### Forging Federation and Judicial Might\nO'Connor's role in Australia's federation movement was nothing short of a high-stakes poker game, where he bet big on unity and won. As one of the first justices appointed to the High Court in 1903, he shaped landmark decisions that welded the colonies into a cohesive nation. \"O'Connor was the unsung hero who stitched our federation together,\" noted historian Geoffrey Blainey in his 1980s analysis, highlighting the judge's deft navigation of constitutional complexities.\n\n#### Legacy in the Modern Mirror\nYet, O'Connor's influence extends beyond dusty law books, inspiring ongoing reflections on justice and equity in a world of rapid change. \"His commitment to fairness remains a beacon for reformers,\" observed legal scholar Anne Twomey in a recent lecture, underscoring his enduring relevance. As Australia grapples with contemporary challenges, O'Connor's principles of balanced governance promise to illuminate the path forward."}

They had a beam of 60 ft (18 m) and a draught of 20 ft (6.1 m). The ships displaced 7,144 long tons (7,259 t) as designed and up to 7,670 long tons (7,793 t) at full load. The ships' hulls were constructed out of steel, and were built with a naval ram in the bow. Steering was controlled by a single rudder. Each vessel had a crew of 363 officers and enlisted men. Two heavy military masts were fitted, one just in front of the main battery guns and one behind. A hurricane deck covered the turrets and ran from the foremast to the funnels. Each ship carried a pair of second-class torpedo boats astern of the funnels, along with derricks to unload them.\n\nDingyuan and Zhenyuan were powered by a pair of horizontal, three-cylinder trunk steam engines, each of which drove a single screw propeller. Steam was provided by eight cylindrical boilers that were ducted into a pair of funnels amidships. The boilers were divided into four boiler rooms. The engines were rated at 6,000 indicated horsepower (4,500 kW) for a top speed of 14.5 knots (26.9 km\/h; 16.7 mph), though both ships exceeded these figures on trials, with Zhenyuan, the faster of the two, reaching 7,200 ihp (5,400 kW) and 15.4 kn (28.5 km\/h; 17.7 mph). The ships carried 700 long tons (711 t) of coal normally and up to 1,000 long tons (1,016 t); this enabled a cruising radius of 4,500 nautical miles (8,300 km; 5,200 mi) at a speed of 10 kn (19 km\/h; 12 mph). Both ships were fitted with sails for the voyage from Germany to China, though they were later removed.\n\n ### Armament and armour\n\nThe ships were armed with a main battery of four 12 in (305 mm) 20-caliber guns, mounted in two barbettes. The barbettes are sometimes reported to have been in different arrangements on Dingyuan and Zhenyuan, but both ships' guns were arranged identically, with the starboard barbette forward of the port one. The guns themselves were 31.5-long-ton (32 t) Krupp guns. The placement of the guns caused trim problems that led the ships to be wet forward.\n\nThe secondary battery consisted of two 5.9 in (150 mm) guns mounted individually, one on the bow and the other on the stern. For defence against torpedo boats, they carried a pair of 47 mm (1.9 in) Hotchkiss revolver cannons and eight 37 mm (1.5 in) Maxim-Nordenfelt quick-firing guns in casemates.\n\nThree 14 in (356 mm) torpedo tubes rounded out the armament; one was mounted in the stern, and the other two were placed forward of the main battery, all above water. They are sometimes reported to have been 15 in (381 mm) torpedo tubes.\n\nThe belt armour of the class was 14 in thick, while the barbettes for the main armament were 12 in. A 3 in (76 mm) armoured deck ran the entire length of the ships, leaving the ends undefended. The conning tower had further plating some 8 in (20 cm) thick, while the 5.9 in guns were each in turrets whose armour was somewhere between 0.5 to 3 in (13 to 76 mm) thick.\n\n ## Ships\n\n","h_score":1665587.1687500002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":44450100,"revid":1136832312,"description":"Chinese class of ironclad warships","categories":["Battleships of the Imperial Japanese Navy","Dingyuan-class ironclads","Russo-Japanese War battleships of Japan","Ships built in Stettin"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Mighty Dingyuan: China's Floating Fortress of Steel\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Dingyuan-class ironclads emerged as groundbreaking warships for the Imperial Chinese Navy, symbolizing China's bold leap into modern naval power with their massive armor and formidable armaments. These vessels, including the Dingyuan and Zhenyuan, played pivotal roles in key conflicts, showcasing both technological innovation and the perils of imperial ambitions.\n\n#### Forged in Fire and Steel\nThe Dingyuan-class ironclads were born from a whirlwind of industrial ambition, ordered from German shipyards in the 1880s as China raced to modernize its fleet amid rising global tensions. These behemoths, with their thick iron plating and towering gun turrets, cut through waves like armored predators, blending Victorian engineering with Eastern resolve in a dance of smoke and steam.\n\n#### Clashes on the High Seas\nDuring the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894\u20131895, the Dingyuan led China's Beiyang Fleet into fierce battles, its cannons roaring like thunderous dragons against Japanese forces. As historian John W. Dower once noted, \"The Dingyuan's resilience in the face of overwhelming odds highlighted the raw power of ironclad warfare.\" Yet, despite its might, the ship met a tragic end, sunk in combat, underscoring the fragility of even the mightiest steel giants.\n\n#### Legacy of the Iron Waves\nBeyond their watery graves, the Dingyuan-class left an indelible mark on naval history, inspiring future designs and serving as a cautionary tale of technological disparity. Military analyst Alfred Thayer Mahan remarked, \"Such vessels as the Dingyuan represent the hinge of maritime evolution, where tradition meets modernity.\" Their story echoes in today's fleets, a reminder of how yesterday's innovations shape tomorrow's seas.\n\nAs naval powers continue to innovate, the Dingyuan's saga hints at the unending quest for dominance on the open ocean."}

Some Yugoslav territory was annexed by its Axis neighbours, Hungary, Bulgaria and Italy. The Germans engineered and supported the creation of the puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia (Croatian: Nezavisna Dr\u017eava Hrvatska, NDH), which roughly comprised most of the pre-war Banovina Croatia, along with rest of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and some adjacent territory. The Italians, Hungarians and Bulgarians occupied other parts of Yugoslavian territory. Germany did not annex any Yugoslav territory, but occupied northern parts of present-day Slovenia and stationed occupation troops in the northern half of the NDH. The German-occupied part of Slovenia was divided into two areas that were placed under the administration of the Gauleiters of the neighbouring Reichsgau K\u00e4rnten and Reichsgau Steiermark.\n\nThe remaining territory, which consisted of Serbia proper, the northern part of Kosovo (around Kosovska Mitrovica), and the Banat was occupied by the Germans and placed under the administration of a German military government. This was due to the key rail and riverine transport routes that passed through it, and its valuable resources, particularly non-ferrous metals.\n\nIn May, German troops of the 750th Infantry Regiment of the 704th Infantry Division were stationed in the Ma\u010dva, Jadra and Pocerina (Cer) districts of the Podrinje region, garrisoning \u0160abac, Banja Kovilja\u010da and Loznica.\n\nIn early July, shortly after the launching of Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union, armed resistance began in the German-occupied territory of Serbia, against both the German Army and the representatives of the German-installed puppet government known as the Commissioner Government. This was a response to appeals from both Joseph Stalin and the Communist International for communist organisations across occupied Europe to draw German troops away from the Eastern Front, and followed a meeting of the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party in Belgrade on 4 July. This meeting resolved to shift to a general uprising, form Partisan detachments of fighters and commence armed resistance, and call for the populace to rise up against the occupiers throughout Yugoslavia. This also coincided with the departure of the last of the German invasion force that had remained to oversee the transition to occupation. From the appearance of posters and pamphlets urging the population to undertake sabotage, it rapidly turned to attempted and actual sabotage of German propaganda facilities and railway and telephone lines. The first fighting occurred at the village of Bela Crkva on 7 July, when gendarmes tried to disperse a public meeting, and two gendarmes were killed.\n\n","h_score":1667963.71875,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":17625858,"revid":1172802026,"description":"Battle between Serbian Chetniks and Germans in Serbia","categories":["1941 in Yugoslavia","August 1941 events","Battles of World War II involving Chetniks","Battles of World War II involving Germany","Conflicts in 1941","Loznica","Yugoslavia in World War II"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What was the Battle of Loznica in 1941?  \nA1: The Battle of Loznica was a military engagement during World War II in Yugoslavia, involving Yugoslav partisans and Chetniks against Axis forces.

His inaugural lecture at Imperial College concerned the large sieve: bounding the size of sets of integers from which many congruence classes of numbers modulo prime numbers have been forbidden. Roth had previously published a paper on this problem in 1965.\n\nAnother of Roth's interests was the Heilbronn triangle problem, of placing points in a square to avoid triangles of small area. His 1951 paper on the problem was the first to prove a nontrivial upper bound on the area that can be achieved. He eventually published four papers on this problem, the latest in 1976. Roth also made significant progress on square packing in a square. If unit squares are packed into an $s\\times s$ square in the obvious, axis-parallel way, then for values of $s$ that are just below an integer, nearly $2s$ area can be left uncovered. After Paul Erd\u0151s and Ronald Graham proved that a more clever tilted packing could leave a significantly smaller area, only $O(s^{7\/11})$, Roth and Bob Vaughan responded with a 1978 paper proving the first nontrivial lower bound on the problem. As they showed, for some values of $s$, the uncovered area must be at least proportional to $\\sqrt{s}$.\n\nIn 1966, Heini Halberstam and Roth published their book Sequences, on integer sequences. Initially planned to be the first of a two-volume set, its topics included the densities of sums of sequences, bounds on the number of representations of integers as sums of members of sequences, density of sequences whose sums represent all integers, sieve theory and the probabilistic method, and sequences in which no element is a multiple of another. A second edition was published in 1983.\n\n ## Recognition\n\nRoth won the Fields Medal in 1958 for his work on Diophantine approximation. He was the first British Fields medalist. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1960, and later became an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Fellow of University College London, Fellow of Imperial College London, and Honorary Fellow of Peterhouse. It was a source of amusement to him that his Fields Medal, election to the Royal Society, and professorial chair came to him in the reverse order of their prestige.\n\nThe London Mathematical Society gave Roth the De Morgan Medal in 1983. In 1991, the Royal Society gave him their Sylvester Medal \"for his many contributions to number theory and in particular his solution of the famous problem concerning approximating algebraic numbers by rationals.\"\n\nA festschrift of 32 essays on topics related to Roth's research was published in 2009, in honour of Roth's 80th birthday, and in 2017 the editors of the journal Mathematika dedicated a special issue to Roth. After Roth's death, the Imperial College Department of Mathematics instituted the Roth Scholarship in his honour.\n\n ## Selected publications\n\n ### Journal papers\n\n\n ### Book\n\n- A second edition was published in 1983 by Springer-Verlag.","h_score":1736856.8562500002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":787827,"revid":1170425438,"description":"British mathematician","categories":["1925 births","2015 deaths","20th-century English mathematicians","Academics of Imperial College London","Academics of University College London","Alumni of Peterhouse, Cambridge","Alumni of University College London","De Morgan Medallists","Fellows of the Royal Society","Fields Medalists","Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to the United Kingdom","Number theorists","People educated at St Paul's School, London","People from the Province of Lower Silesia"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Klaus Roth, the mathematical maestro who danced with numbers?  \nA1: Klaus Roth was a renowned British mathematician, born in 1925 in Breslau, Germany (now Wroc\u0142aw, Poland), and he passed away in 2015.

That, and the evidence presented against him by his sister Jennet, who said that she had seen her brother asking a black dog he had conjured up to help him kill Townley, was sufficient to persuade the jury to find him guilty. 19 August The trials of the three Samlesbury witches were heard before Anne Redferne's first appearance in court, late in the afternoon, charged with the murder of Robert Nutter. The evidence against her was considered unsatisfactory, and she was acquitted. Anne Redferne was not so fortunate the following day, when she faced her second trial, for the murder of Robert Nutter's father, Christopher, to which she pleaded not guilty. Demdike's statement to Nowell, which accused Anne of having made clay figures of the Nutter family, was read out in court. Witnesses were called to testify that Anne was a witch \"more dangerous than her Mother\". But she refused to admit her guilt to the end, and had given no evidence against any others of the accused. Anne Redferne was found guilty. Jane Bulcock and her son John Bulcock, both from Newchurch in Pendle, were accused and found guilty of the murder by witchcraft of Jennet Deane. Both denied that they had attended the meeting at Malkin Tower, but Jennet Device identified Jane as having been one of those present, and John as having turned the spit to roast the stolen sheep, the centrepiece of the Good Friday meeting at the Demdike's home. Alice Nutter was unusual among the accused in being comparatively wealthy, the widow of a tenant yeoman farmer. She made no statement either before or during her trial, except to enter her plea of not guilty to the charge of murdering Henry Mitton by witchcraft. The prosecution alleged that she, together with Demdike and Elizabeth Device, had caused Mitton's death after he had refused to give Demdike a penny she had begged from him. The only evidence against Alice seems to have been that James Device claimed Demdike had told him of the murder, and Jennet Device in her statement said that Alice had been present at the Malkin Tower meeting. Alice may have called in on the meeting at Malkin Tower on her way to a secret (and illegal) Good Friday Catholic service, and refused to speak for fear of incriminating her fellow Catholics. Many of the Nutter family were Catholics, and two had been executed as Jesuit priests, John Nutter in 1584 and his brother Robert in 1600. Alice Nutter was found guilty. Katherine Hewitt (a.k.a. Mould-Heeles) was charged and found guilty of the murder of Anne Foulds. She was the wife of a clothier from Colne, and had attended the meeting at Malkin Tower with Alice Grey. According to the evidence given by James Device, both Hewitt and Grey told the others at that meeting that they had killed a child from Colne, Anne Foulds. Jennet Device also picked Katherine out of a line-up, and confirmed her attendance at the Malkin Tower meeting. Alice Grey was accused with Katherine Hewitt of the murder of Anne Foulds. Potts does not provide an account of Alice Grey's trial, simply recording her as one of the Samlesbury witches \u2013 which she was not, as she was one of those identified as having been at the Malkin Tower meeting \u2013 and naming her in the list of those found not guilty. Alizon Device, whose encounter with John Law had triggered the events leading up to the trials, was charged with causing harm by witchcraft. Uniquely among the accused, Alizon was confronted in court by her alleged victim, John Law. She seems to have genuinely believed in her own guilt; when Law was brought into court Alizon fell to her knees in tears and confessed. She was found guilty. ## The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster\n\nAlmost everything that is known about the trials comes from a report of the proceedings written by Thomas Potts, the clerk to the Lancaster Assizes. Potts was instructed to write his account by the trial judges, and had completed the work by 16 November 1612, when he submitted it for review. Bromley revised and corrected the manuscript before its publication in 1613, declaring it to be \"truly reported\" and \"fit and worthie to be published\".\n\nAlthough written as an apparently verbatim account, The Wonderfull Discoverie is not a report of what was actually said at the trial but is instead reflecting what happened. Nevertheless, Potts \"seems to give a generally trustworthy, although not comprehensive, account of an Assize witchcraft trial, provided that the reader is constantly aware of his use of written material instead of verbatim reports\".\n\nThe trials took place not quite seven years after the Gunpowder Plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament in an attempt to kill King James and the Protestant aristocracy had been foiled. It was alleged that the Pendle witches had hatched their own gunpowder plot to blow up Lancaster Castle, although historian Stephen Pumfrey has suggested that the \"preposterous scheme\" was invented by the examining magistrates and simply agreed to by James Device in his witness statement. It may therefore be significant that Potts dedicated The Wonderfull Discoverie to Thomas Knyvet and his wife Elizabeth; Knyvet was the man credited with apprehending Guy Fawkes and thus saving the King.\n\n","h_score":1717826.40625,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":19269991,"revid":1166933158,"description":"English witch hunt and trial in 1612","categories":["1612 in England","1612 in law","17th-century executions by England","17th-century trials","Borough of Pendle","English people executed for witchcraft","Executed English women","History of Lancashire","Lancashire folklore","People executed by Stuart England","Witch trials in England"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What were the Pendle witches?  \nA1: The Pendle witches refer to a group of people accused of witchcraft in England during the early 17th century.

The game has an aggregated review score of 90 out of 100 at Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu magazine scored the PlayStation 2 version of the game a 30 out of 40. The game is considered by some to be one of the greatest games of all time; Edge ranked Ico as the 13th top game in a 2007 listing, while IGN ranked the game at number 18 in 2005, and at number 57 in 2007. Ico has been used as an example of a game that is a work of art. Ueda commented that he purposely tried to distance Ico from conventional video games due to the negative image video games were receiving at that time, in order to draw more people to the title. Some reviewers have likened Ico to older, simpler adventure games such as Prince of Persia or Tomb Raider, that seek to evoke an emotional experience from the player; IGN's David Smith commented that while simple, as an experience the game was \"near indescribable.\" The game's graphics and sound contributed strongly to the positive reactions from critics; Smith continues that \"The visuals, sound, and original puzzle design come together to make something that is almost, if not quite, completely unlike anything else on the market, and feels wonderful because of it.\" Many reviewers were impressed with the expansiveness and the details given to the environments, the animation used for the main characters despite their low polygon count, as well as the use of lighting effects. Ico's ambiance, created by the simple music and the small attention to detail in the voice work of the main characters, were also called out as strong points for the game. Charles Herold of The New York Times summed up his review stating that \"Ico is not a perfect game, but it is a game of perfect moments.\" Herold later commented that Ico breaks the mold of games that usually involve companions. In most games these companions are invulnerable and players will generally not concern with the non-playable characters' fate, but Ico creates the sense of \"trust and childish fragility\" around Yorda, which leads to the character being \"the game's entire focus\". The game is noted for its simple combat system that would \"disappoint those craving sheer mechanical depth\", as stated by GameSpot's Miguel Lopez. The game's puzzle design has been praised for creating a rewarding experience for players who work through challenges on their own; Kristen Reed of Eurogamer, for example, said that \"you quietly, logically, willingly proceed, and the illusion is perfect: the game never tells you what to do, even though the game is always telling you what to do\". Ico is also considered a short game, taking between seven and ten hours for a single play through, which Game Revolution calls \"painfully short\" with \"no replay outside of self-imposed challenges\". G4TV's Matthew Keil, however, felt that \"the game is so strong, many will finish 'Ico' in one or two sittings\". The lack of features in the North American release, which would become unlocked on subsequent playthroughs after completing the game, was said to reduce the replay value of the title. Electronic Gaming Monthly notes that \"Yorda would probably be the worst companion -she's scatterbrained and helpless; if not for the fact that the player develops a bond with her, making the game's ending all the more heartrending.\" Francesca Reyes reviewed the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"Intensely involving and wonderfully simple, Ico, though flawed, deserves to find its niche as a quiet classic.\" Despite the positive praise, the original title did not sell well. By 2009, only 700,000 copies were sold worldwide, with 270,000 in the United States, and the bulk in PAL regions. Ueda considered his design by subtraction approach may have hurt the marketing of the game, as at the time of the game's release, promotion of video games were primarily done through screenshots, and as Ico lacked any heads-up display, it appeared uninteresting to potential buyers. ### Awards\n\nIco received several acclamations from the video game press, and was considered to be one of the Games of the Year by many publications, despite competing with releases such as Halo: Combat Evolved, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, and Grand Theft Auto III. The game received three Game Developers Choice Awards in 2002, including \"Excellence in Level Design\", \"Excellence in Visual Arts\", and \"Game Innovation Spotlight\". The game won two Interactive Achievement Awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences in 2002 for outstanding achievements in \"Art Direction\" and \"Character or Story Development\"; it also received nominations for \"Game of the Year\", \"Console Game of the Year\", \"Console Action\/Adventure Game of the Year\", \"Innovation in Console Gaming\", and outstanding achievements in \"Game Design\", and \"Sound Design\". It won GameSpot's annual \"Best Graphics, Artistic\" prize among console games. It was one of three titles to win the Special Award at the sixth CESA Game Awards.\n\n","h_score":1730158.5375000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":161487,"revid":1169680794,"description":"2001 Japanese action-adventure video game","categories":["2001 video games","Action-adventure games","Art games","Cancelled PlayStation (console) games","Cooperative video games","D.I.C.E.

In April, at the Ohio Grand Prix, he broke the record again, with a time of 48.34 seconds, also defeating Michael Phelps.\n\nA month before the Olympics, in July 2008, he broke his South American record in the 50-metre freestyle, with a time of 21.75 seconds.\n\nAfterward, Cielo went to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where he broke the Americas record in the 4\u00d7100-metre freestyle heats, with a time of 47.91 seconds. Although the Brazilian team was disqualified, Cielo's record was allowed to stand. In the 100-metre freestyle, Cielo qualified for the final, taking eighth place in the heats, with a time of 48.07 seconds. Cielo excelled in the early part of the first semifinal, making his turn in second place, at 22.62 seconds, but finishing fifth. In the final, Cielo adopted a different tactic, turning third, slower (22.74 seconds) than in the semifinals, and saving energy for the finish, which resulted in his winning the bronze medal and breaking the South American record with a time of 47.67 seconds (tied with American swimmer Jason Lezak). Alain Bernard won the gold medal and Eamon Sullivan won the silver. Shortly after winning the bronze medal, Cielo gave a statement to the Brazilian press, stating categorically: \"Now I'm going to win the 50m\". In the 50-metre freestyle event, Cielo set the Olympic record, that Alexander Popov had set in the 1992 Summer Olympics, during the heats (21.47 seconds, equaling Garrett Weber-Gale's Americas record) and in the semifinals (21.34 seconds). He lowered this further in the finals, again breaking the Olympic record with a time of 21.30 seconds, winning the gold medal and missing the world record by 0.02 seconds. With this, he became the first Brazilian Olympic swimming champion. Until Cielo's Olympic gold, the best Brazilian Olympic swimming result had been obtained by Ricardo Prado, who won the silver medal in the 400-metre individual medley at the 1984 Summer Olympics, and previously Gustavo Borges, who won the silver medal in the 100-metre freestyle at the 1992 Summer Olympics and in the 200-metre freestyle at the 1996 Summer Olympics.\n\nAfter the Olympics, in October, in the first stage of the 2008 FINA Swimming World Cup, held in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, Cielo equaled the short-course South American record in the 50-metre freestyle, with a time of 21.32 seconds.\n\n","h_score":1697486.9187500002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":12627202,"revid":1171578538,"description":"Brazilian swimmer","categories":["1987 births","Auburn Tigers men's swimmers","Brazilian male backstroke swimmers","Brazilian male butterfly swimmers","Brazilian male freestyle swimmers","Brazilian people of Italian descent","Brazilian sportspeople in doping cases","Doping cases in swimming","Living people","Medalists at the 2007 Pan American Games","Medalists at the 2008 Summer Olympics","Medalists at the 2011 Pan American Games","Medalists at the 2012 Summer Olympics","Medalists at the FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m)","Olympic bronze medalists for Brazil","Olympic bronze medalists in swimming","Olympic gold medalists for Brazil","Olympic gold medalists in swimming","Olympic swimmers for Brazil","Pan American Games gold medalists for Brazil","Pan American Games medalists in swimming","Pan American Games silver medalists for Brazil","People from Santa B\u00e1rbara d'Oeste","Swimmers at the 2007 Pan American Games","Swimmers at the 2008 Summer Olympics","Swimmers at the 2011 Pan American Games","Swimmers at the 2012 Summer Olympics","Swimmers from S\u00e3o Paulo (state)","World Aquatics Championships medalists in swimming","World record holders in swimming"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Brazilian Bullet: C\u00e9sar Cielo's Electrifying Swim Through Glory\n\nIn the high-stakes world of competitive swimming, C\u00e9sar Cielo emerged as a powerhouse from Brazil, clinching Olympic gold and shattering world records with his explosive speed. Yet, his career has been a rollercoaster of triumphs and controversies, including a high-profile doping accusation that was ultimately dismissed.\n\n#### From Rio's Waves to World Stages\nBorn in 1987 in Santa B\u00e1rbara d'Oeste, Brazil, C\u00e9sar Cielo dove into swimming as a child, quickly rising through the ranks with a blend of raw talent and unyielding determination. Like a silver fish cutting through turbulent waters, he captured national attention by age 15, eventually representing Brazil in the 2008 Beijing Olympics where he exploded onto the global scene. His journey reflects the vibrant pulse of Brazilian sports culture, where backyard pools transform into launchpads for international stardom.\n\n#### Peaks and Pitfalls in the Pool\nCielo's crowning moment came in the 50-meter freestyle, where he not only won gold but also set a world record, earning him the nickname \"The Human Torpedo.\" However, his path hit choppy waters in 2011 when a positive drug test threatened his legacy; \"Swimming is about heart, not shortcuts,\" Cielo declared in his defense, showcasing his resilience amid the storm. Another observer, former coach Alberto Silva, noted, \"C\u00e9sar's speed was unmatched, but the scrutiny nearly drowned his spirit.\"\n\n#### A Lasting Ripple Effect\nBeyond the medals, Cielo's influence has inspired a new wave of Brazilian athletes, emphasizing discipline and passion in the face of adversity.

Such cracks are caused by high loads where the wheels contact the rail. Repeated high loading causes fatigue cracks to grow. When they reach a critical size, the rail fails. Portions of the failed track at Hatfield were reassembled and numerous fatigue cracks were identified. They contributed to the spalling of the running surface to around five millimetres (0.2 in) deep and 100 millimetres (3.9 in) long.\n\nThe problem was known about before the accident; a letter from the infrastructure company Railtrack in December 1999 warned that the existing Railtrack Line Specification was insufficient to guard against this type of fatigue. Replacement rails were made available but never delivered to the correct location for installation.\n\nSince privatisation, Railtrack had divested the engineering knowledge of British Rail to contractors. While it had comprehensive maintenance procedures that might have prevented the accident if followed appropriately, later investigation showed there was a serious problem with the experience and working knowledge of staff. In a subsequent interview, the Zone Quality Standards Manager said, \"I do not have knowledge of railway engineering nor railway safety\", which was completely contrary to the written requirements for the role. In May 1999, the Head of Track had said that insufficiently-skilled work was causing more rails to break. Railtrack did not know how many other cases of rail fatigue around the network could lead to a similar accident. It consequently imposed over 1,800 emergency speed restrictions and instigated a costly nationwide track replacement programme. The company was subject to \"enforcement\" by the Rail Regulator, Tom Winsor.\n\n","h_score":1740200.20625,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":917407,"revid":1116575703,"description":"2000 rail accident in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, England","categories":["2000 disasters in the United Kingdom","2000s in Hertfordshire","Hatfield, Hertfordshire","History of Hertfordshire","October 2000 events in the United Kingdom","Railway accidents and incidents in Hertfordshire","Railway accidents in 2000"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Hatfield Rail Crash: A Turning Point in UK Rail Safety\n\nThe Hatfield rail crash on October 17, 2000, involved a high-speed train derailing near Hatfield station, resulting in four deaths and over 70 injuries. This incident highlighted significant issues with rail infrastructure maintenance and triggered sweeping reforms across the British rail network.\n\n#### The Incident\nA Great North Eastern Railway train traveling from London to Leeds derailed at approximately 115 mph when a rail fractured beneath it. Emergency services responded quickly, but the crash caused immediate chaos, with passengers describing the event as sudden and terrifying. Investigators later examined the site, focusing on the broken rail as the key factor.\n\n#### Causes and Investigation\nThe official inquiry determined that the derailment stemmed from gauge corner cracking, a form of rail fatigue exacerbated by poor maintenance practices. \"The rail's condition was a direct result of inadequate inspection routines,\" noted the Health and Safety Executive in their report. This finding led to widespread speed restrictions on tracks nationwide while further probes continued.\n\n#### Impact and Reforms\nThe crash exposed systemic flaws in the privatized rail system, prompting the government to invest in better track monitoring and renewal programs. It resulted in prosecutions for rail operators and a cultural shift toward prioritizing safety. \"We need to learn from this to protect the public,\" emphasized then Transport Secretary John Prescott in a statement to Parliament.\n\nMoving forward, ongoing advancements in rail technology and regular safety audits aim to prevent such accidents in the modern rail system."}

Before the race began, Valtteri Bottas was sidelined due to a back injury sustained in qualifying. Both Daniil Kvyat's Red Bull and Kevin Magnussen's McLaren failed to make it to the grid as their cars broke down on the out-lap; Kvyat suffering transmission problems and Magnussen with an engine failure. This left the grid with 15 starters \u2013 the lowest number for a season-opening race since 1963 and the lowest overall since the infamous 2005 United States Grand Prix.\n\nAt the start, Hamilton assumed the lead while a three-car wide tussle at turn one, involving Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, Felipe Nasr and Pastor Maldonado, resulted in Maldonado crashing out at turn two and race officials deploying the safety car. The next lap, Romain Grosjean's car failed thus taking both Lotus cars out of the race. Normal racing resumed on lap four, with Carlos Sainz Jr. falling back from fifth to his starting position in seventh place after being passed by Nasr and Daniel Ricciardo. Nasr also lost track position after being ordered by his team to relinquish a position for overtaking while still under safety car conditions.\n\nHamilton maintained in the lead until lap 25, when he made a pit stop for tyres. He resumed the lead from Rosberg after he too had to pit for new tyres. During this series of pitstops, Sebastian Vettel gained a position by passing Felipe Massa for third place. On lap 34, Max Verstappen retired while in a points-scoring position after his Toro Rosso was engulfed by smoke. On lap 42, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen also retired at turn four after a botched pitstop caused his left rear tyre to come loose.

Initially, Mary Lambert was appointed director, but was soon replaced by Pierson. Warner Bros. gave Pierson a \\$14,000 budget for the shooting, which took place in Los Angeles in February 1984. Christopher Ciccone, the singer's brother, and Erika Belle appeared in the video as dancers; Ciccone recalled that, \"[Madonna] asked us to dance in her 'Lucky Star' video [...] We shoot at the old Charlie Chaplin studio [...] I get paid just \\$200 and don't get any royalties either. However, at the time, I am happy just to be a part of it. The camaraderie between Madonna, Erika, Martin [Burgoyne], and me is enough for me\".\n\nIn the video, Madonna wore a black outfit consisting of a mesh crop top, fingerless lace gloves, skirt over leggings, and stars and crucifixes dangling from her ears and around her waist. Although Belle was credited with coming up with the ensemble, biographer Mary Cross noted that Madonna was wearing her \"day-to-day\" clothing. At the time of the song's release, the singer's fashion was catching on as a statement among club kids and her fans, with the crucifixes she wore as earrings being the most prominent; Madonna herself commented that, \"[wearing a crucifix] was kind of offbeat and interesting. I mean, everything I do is sort of tongue-in-cheek. Besides, [the crucifixes] seem to go with my name.\" Cross however, wrote that the singer was trying to find a distinctive image for herself, and stand out among artists like Boy George, Cyndi Lauper, and David Bowie. \"Lucky Star\" was added to MTV the week of June 2, 1984; afterwards, it was added to Madonna's video compilations The Immaculate Collection (1990) and Celebration: The Video Collection (2009).\n\nThe visual starts with a black and white close-up of Madonna's face, as she slides her sunglasses down her nose. The image then fades to white and resumes in color. Scenes of Madonna, Ciccone and Belle dancing against a plain white background are interspersed with closeups of the singer's \"mesmerized\" gaze. The video ends with the initial black-and-white image repeated, but in retrograde, as Madonna puts back on the sunglasses.\n\n","h_score":1747885.59375,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":2288351,"revid":1173651024,"description":"1983 single by Madonna","categories":["1983 singles","1983 songs","Madonna songs","Post-disco songs","Sire Records singles","Song recordings produced by Reggie Lucas","Songs written by Madonna","Warner Records singles"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is \"Lucky Star\" by Madonna?  \nA1: \"Lucky Star\" is a vibrant pop song from Madonna's early career, serving as a standout track on her 1983 debut album.

After much confusion, SS Division Hitlerjugend got moving at about 14:30; several units advanced towards one of the beaches on which the Allies had landed, until they were halted by naval and anti-tank fire and Allied air interdiction. Meyer, confident that the Allied forces were \"little fishes\", ordered his regiment to counterattack. The attack led to heavy casualties. The division was ordered to break through to the beach on 7 June, but Meyer instructed his regiment to take covering positions and await reinforcements. The Canadian Official History described Meyer's involvement in the battle: > Although Meyer claimed later that only shortage of petrol and ammunition prevented him from carrying the attack on towards the coast, this need not be taken seriously. Indeed, he himself testified that seeing from his lofty perch \"enemy movements deeper in that area\"\u2014doubtless the advance of the main body of the 9th Brigade\u2014he came down and rode his motorcycle to the 3rd Battalion to order its C.O. \"not to continue the attack north of Buron\". Meyer's 2nd Battalion had been drawn into the fight, north of St. Contest \"in the direction of Galmanche\". Fierce fighting was going on when Meyer visited the battalion in the early evening; just as he arrived the battalion commander's head was taken off by a tank shot ... Meyer ordered both this battalion and the 1st (around Cambes) to go \"over from attack to defense.\" By 22:00, Meyer had set up his command post in Ardenne Abbey. That evening, elements of the division under Meyer's command committed the Ardenne Abbey massacre; eleven Canadian prisoners of war, soldiers from the North Nova Scotia Highlanders and the 27th Armoured Regiment were shot in the back of the head. On 14 June, divisional commander SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer Fritz Witt was killed when a naval barrage hit his command post. Meyer, the next-highest-ranking officer, was promoted to divisional commander; at 33 years of age, he was one of the war's youngest German divisional commanders. According to historian Peter Lieb, Meyer's rise to division command was relatively typical for the Waffen-SS, as the latter desired individuals as commanders who were regarded as ruthless, brutal, and ready to serve at the front line. By 4 July, the division had been reduced to a weak battlegroup; six days later, it retreated behind the Orne River. In just over a month of fighting, the division had more than a 60 per cent casualty rate. The Canadian forces began their advance on Falaise, planning to meet up with the Americans with the goal of encircling and destroying most of the German forces in Normandy. The Hitlerjugend division was holding the northern point of what became known as the Falaise pocket. After several days of fighting Meyer's unit was reduced to about 1,500 men, whom he led in an attempt to break out of the pocket. Meyer described the conditions in the pocket in his memoirs: \"Concentrated in such a confined space, we offer unique targets for the enemy air power. [...] Death shadows us at every step\". Meyer was wounded during the fight with the 3rd Canadian Division, but escaped from the Falaise pocket with the division's rearguard. The remnants of the division joined the retreat across the Seine and into Belgium. On 27 August, Meyer was awarded the Swords to the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and promoted to SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer. He led his retreating unit as far as the Meuse, where he and his headquarters were ambushed by an American armoured column on 6 September. The division's staff fled into a nearby village, where Meyer and his driver hid in a barn. A farmer discovered them, and informed the Belgian resistance. Meyer surrendered to local partisans, who handed him over to the Americans on 7 September.","h_score":1727316.6375000002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":1673302,"revid":1167748022,"description":"German SS officer (1910\u20131961)","categories":["1910 births","1961 deaths","German mass murderers","German prisoners of war in World War II held by the United Kingdom","German prisoners of war in World War II held by the United States","German prisoners sentenced to death","Hitler Youth members","Members of HIAG","Military personnel from Lower Saxony","Nazi Party members","Nazis convicted of war crimes","People from Helmstedt (district)","Perpetrators of World War II prisoner of war massacres","Prisoners sentenced to death by Canada","Recipients of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords","SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer","Waffen-SS personnel"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Kurt Meyer, the man who danced on the edge of history's blade?  \nA1: Kurt Meyer was a notorious German Waffen-SS commander during World War II, often called \"Panzer Meyer\" for his armored prowess.

He served in various units, including the elite Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, where his aggressive style earned him promotions. By the late 1930s, he was already a decorated soldier, foreshadowing his role in larger conflicts.\n\nQ4: How did Meyer make his mark during World War II?  \nA4: As commander of the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend, Meyer led daring assaults in Normandy, turning battlefields into chaotic canvases of steel and fire. His tactics were bold, blending speed and surprise to outmaneuver allies, but they often blurred the lines of warfare ethics. This period cemented his reputation as a tactical genius amid the war's brutal symphony.\n\nQ5: What controversies swirl around Meyer's wartime actions?  \nA5: Meyer faced accusations of war crimes, including the massacre of Canadian prisoners during the Normandy campaign, painting him as a villain in the annals of conflict. These acts, rooted in the SS's ruthless doctrine, sparked international outrage and legal scrutiny. Yet, defenders argue the fog of war distorted the full picture, adding layers to his complex legacy.\n\nQ6: What happened in Meyer's post-war trials and imprisonment?  \nA6: Captured by Allied forces in 1945, Meyer was tried at the Dachau trials in 1946 for war crimes, receiving a death sentence that was later commuted to life imprisonment. He served time in various prisons before being released in 1954 due to health issues, spending his final years in quiet obscurity. This twist of fate highlights the uneven hand of justice in war's aftermath.\n\nQ7: How is Meyer remembered in historical discussions today?  \nA7: Modern views of Meyer are polarized, with some seeing him as a skilled military leader trapped in a monstrous regime, while others condemn him as a war criminal. Historians often use his story to explore the ethics of obedience and the human cost of ideology. His legacy serves as a vivid cautionary tale in books, documentaries, and debates about World War II.\n\nQ8: Are there any lesser-known angles to Meyer's life that surprise us?  \nA8: Beyond the battlefield, Meyer was an avid outdoorsman and family man, writing memoirs that reveal a more introspective side to his armored exterior. Some accounts suggest he grappled with remorse in his later years, adding an unexpected layer of humanity to his story. This hidden depth challenges us to view history not just as black and white, but as a tapestry of grays."}

It was built in 1838 in recognition of Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1830 to 1834. In particular, it celebrates the passing of the Great Reform Act of 1832, one of Grey's most important legislative achievements. The act reorganised the system of parliamentary constituencies and increased the number of those eligible to vote.\n\nThe monument is located at the junction of Grey, Grainger and Blackett Streets and has a total height of 133 ft (41 m). It was funded via public subscription and consists of a statue of Earl Grey on a pedestal standing on top of a Roman Doric column. The column was designed by local architect, Benjamin Green, and the statue was created by the sculptor, Edward Hodges Baily.\n\nA contemporary report of the unveiling ceremony described the monument as \"a fine imaginative work of art\" and other 19th century commentators praised it as \"a noble effort of genius\" and as having \"a most commanding appearance\". However, its location, then at the centre of the city's tram infrastructure, was criticised as unsuitable, with one newspaper declaring that \"in its present situation, it will be a great nuisance\" and, in the 1920s, there were calls to move the column to improve traffic flow. In 1981, the nearby station on the Tyne and Wear Metro was named after the monument. The pedestrianised area around the base is a popular meeting place and is used as a speakers' corner.\n\n ## History\n\n ### Context\n\nGrey's Monument was erected in recognition of the tenure of Charles Grey as Prime Minister. Earl Grey represented Northumberland in Parliament from the age of 22. He was made First Lord of the Admiralty in 1806, and later Leader of the House of Commons. In 1830 he was invited to form a government and became Prime Minister. It was during his time as Prime Minister that he passed the Great Reform Act, which brought about constituency reform and extended the right to vote. Grey's Monument was constructed when Grey was still alive and had retired from politics.\n\n","h_score":1729594.125,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":3120136,"revid":1145787610,"description":"Monument in Newcastle upon Tyne dedicated to Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey","categories":["Buildings and structures in Newcastle upon Tyne","Grade I listed buildings in Tyne and Wear","Grade I listed monuments and memorials","John and Benjamin Green buildings and structures","Monuments and memorials in Tyne and Wear","Statues in England","Tourist attractions in Newcastle upon Tyne"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Grey's Monument: Newcastle's Eternal Watchtower\n\nRising like a stone sentinel amid the hustle of modern Newcastle, Grey's Monument pays homage to the legacy of Charles Grey, blending history with the city's vibrant pulse.\n\nThis iconic column, erected in 1838, encapsulates the spirit of 19th-century Britain, while today it serves as a bustling meeting point for locals and tourists alike.\n\n#### A Storied Past\nGrey's Monument owes its existence to Charles Grey, the 2nd Earl Grey, whose reforms as Prime Minister echo through its granite form.

Shigefumi Hino took the role of graphics designer. Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development handled development with a team of ten people, including three main programmers and a character designer, most of whom had worked on past Super Mario titles. In a retrospective interview, the core team said Miyamoto wielded the most authority during development. Super Mario World was the first Mario series game developed for the then-upcoming Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). As such, the team anticipated some difficulty in working with new and more advanced hardware. According to Tezuka, the software tools were not yet fully developed, and the team had to \"go along with starting something new\". Miyamoto acknowledged the team no longer had restrictions on certain mechanics such as scrolling and the number of colours they could implement. As a hardware experiment, the team ported Super Mario Bros.3 to the SNES. However, it felt like the same game to them, despite the improved colours and sprites. After that, Miyamoto realised the team's goal would be to use the new hardware to create something \"totally new\". Miyamoto said he had wanted Mario to have a dinosaur companion ever since Super Mario Bros., but Nintendo engineers could not add such a character into the game due to the limitations of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The inspiration for Yoshi can be traced back even further; Miyamoto designed a green dragon for the 1984 game Devil World which shared many similarities with Yoshi. During the development of Super Mario Bros.3, Miyamoto had a number of sketches around his desk, including an image of Mario riding a horse. As development of Super Mario World progressed, the team opted to set the game in a \"dinosaur land\", so Tezuka asked designer Shigefumi Hino to draw a reptile-like creature based on Miyamoto's sketches. Hino originally produced a design that Tezuka deemed too reptilian, and \"didn't really fit into the Mario world\", so he encouraged the designer to create a \"cuter\" character. Tezuka speculated that Miyamoto's love of horse riding, as well as country and western themes, influenced Yoshi's creation. Reflecting on how he had created different melodies for Super Mario Bros.3, composer Koji Kondo decided to reuse the same themes for Super Mario World, albeit in a rearranged form. By doing this, he assumed players would be able to recognise the same melodies, while exposing them to new variations of music as they progressed through the game. As Super Mario World was the first game developed for the SNES, Kondo felt \"overjoyed\" at being able to compose music by using eight sounds at once. To express the technological novelty of the new console, he used several different instruments, implementing them all one after the other in the game's title song. As development progressed, Kondo grew concerned over how people would react to his unusual combinations of instruments as he noted the use of more traditional square waves and triangle waves had \"gained acceptance\" with consumers. For the game's sound effects, Kondo decided to use a variety of musical instruments, as opposed to square waves, to emphasise that the game used traditional technology with a hybrid of new materials. It took Kondo around a year and a half to write all the music for the game. Super Mario World was produced during the console wars \u2013 a result of the rivalry between Nintendo's SNES and Sega's two-year-old Mega Drive system \u2013 which outsold the console and led to intense competition between the two, being the first time since December 1985 Nintendo did not lead the market though it eventually overtook Sega. Sega's mascot, Sonic the Hedgehog, was seen by many as a faster and \"cooler\" alternative to Mario. After the game's release, Miyamoto admitted publicly he felt it was incomplete and development was rushed toward the end. ## Release\n\nSuper Mario World was first released in Japan on 21 November 1990 under the name of Super Mario World: Super Mario Bros. 4. It was one of two launch games for the SNES in Japan, along with F-Zero. The game was released in North America in August 1991. Nintendo also issued a version for arcade cabinets so players could try the game before buying it.\n\n","h_score":1729795.9375,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":81114,"revid":1171557037,"description":"1990 video game","categories":["1990 video games","Game Boy Advance games","Multiplayer and single-player video games","New Nintendo 3DS games","Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development games","Nintendo Switch Online games","Pack-in video games","Side-scrolling platform games","Super Mario","Super Nintendo Entertainment System games","Video games about dinosaurs","Video games developed in Japan","Video games directed by Takashi Tezuka","Video games produced by Shigeru Miyamoto","Video games scored by Koji Kondo","Video games set on fictional islands","Virtual Console games for Nintendo 3DS","Virtual Console games for Wii","Virtual Console games for Wii U","Works about vacationing"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"# Super Mario World: The Pixelated Odyssey That Redefined Playtime\n\nIn a 1990 release for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Mario World catapulted plumber-turned-hero Mario into lush, side-scrolling worlds filled with colorful enemies and hidden secrets, captivating millions with its innovative level design and power-up mechanics. This game not only solidified Nintendo's dominance in the platformer genre but also introduced enduring elements like Yoshi the dinosaur, blending nostalgia with groundbreaking gameplay that still resonates today.\n\n### A Blast from the Pixel Past\nSuper Mario World emerged from the creative minds at Nintendo in the early '90s, building on the success of earlier Mario titles by expanding to a vast overworld map with over 70 levels, each brimming with vibrant, tropical-themed landscapes that felt like jumping into a living cartoon. Players guided Mario through gravity-defying leaps and turtle-shell tosses, evading pitfalls and bosses in a game that mixed whimsy with precise controls, making it accessible yet endlessly challenging for families worldwide.\n\n### The Magic of Mushroom Kingdoms\nAt its core, the game featured power-ups like the cape feather for flight and fire flowers for fiery combat, turning ordinary gameplay into a symphony of strategic fun that encouraged exploration over mere completion. \"It's all about that joyful sense of discovery,\" said Shigeru Miyamoto, the legendary designer behind Mario, highlighting how every hidden block rewarded curiosity. These elements created a playful rhythm, where unexpected angles\u2014like riding Yoshi through enemy lines\u2014added layers of delight, transforming a simple jump into an art form.\n\n### Legacy in a Digital Age\nThe cultural impact of Super Mario World extends far beyond its era, influencing modern games with its emphasis on replayability and world-building, as seen in titles like Super Mario Odyssey. \"This game set the bar for platformers, blending humor and innovation like no other,\" noted gaming critic Jeremy Parish, underscoring its role in shaping interactive storytelling. Its blend of nostalgia and creativity continues to inspire new generations, proving that pixelated adventures hold timeless appeal.\n\nLooking ahead, Super Mario World\u2019s blueprint may fuel upcoming remakes, ensuring Mario\u2019s leaps remain a cornerstone of gaming innovation for years to come."}

In 1924, Lycorhinus was named, and classified as a cynodont, by Sidney Haughton. Heterodontosaurus was named in 1962 and it, Lycorhinus and Geranosaurus were recognized as closely related ornithischian dinosaurs. Alfred Romer named Heterodontosauridae in 1966 as a family of ornithischian dinosaurs including Heterodontosaurus and Lycorhinus. Kuhn independently proposed Heterodontosauridae in the same year and is sometimes cited as its principal author. It was defined as a clade in 1998 by Paul Sereno and redefined by him in 2005 as the stem clade consisting of Heterodontosaurus tucki and all species more closely related to Heterodontosaurus than to Parasaurolophus walkeri, Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis, Triceratops horridus, or Ankylosaurus magniventris. Heterodontosauridae includes the genera Abrictosaurus, Lycorhinus, and Heterodontosaurus, all from South Africa. While Richard Thulborn once reassigned all three to Lycorhinus, all other authors consider the three genera distinct. Within the family, Heterodontosaurus and Lycorhinus are considered sister taxa, with Abrictosaurus as a basal member. Geranosaurus is also a heterodontosaurid, but is usually considered a nomen dubium because the type specimen is missing all its teeth, making it indistinguishable from any other genus in the family. More recently, the genus Echinodon has been considered a heterodontosaurid in several studies. Lanasaurus was named for an upper jaw in 1975, but more recent discoveries have shown that it belongs to Lycorhinus instead, making Lanasaurus a junior synonym of that genus. Dianchungosaurus was once considered a heterodontosaurid from Asia, but it has since been shown that the remains were a chimera of prosauropod and mesoeucrocodylian remains. Jos\u00e9 Bonaparte also classified the South American Pisanosaurus as a heterodontosaurid at one time, but this animal is now known to be a more basal ornithischian. The membership of Heterodontosauridae is well-established in comparison to its uncertain phylogenetic position. Several early studies suggested that heterodontosaurids were very primitive ornithischians. Due to supposed similarities in the morphology of the forelimbs, Robert Bakker proposed a relationship between heterodontosaurids and early sauropodomorphs like Anchisaurus, bridging the orders Saurischia and Ornithischia. The dominant hypothesis over the last several decades has placed heterodontosaurids as basal ornithopods.","h_score":1729578.2562500001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":5872429,"revid":1172505180,"description":"Extinct family of dinosaurs","categories":["Early Cretaceous extinctions","Heterodontosaurids","Norian first appearances","Prehistoric dinosaur families","Taxa named by Alfred Romer"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Unearthing the Ancient World of Heterodontosauridae\n\nIn the shadowy annals of prehistory, Heterodontosauridae emerge as fascinating early dinosaurs with a mix of sharp and grinding teeth, offering a window into Jurassic ecosystems. These pint-sized herbivores, dating back over 200 million years, played a pivotal role in understanding the evolution of ornithischian dinosaurs and their diverse adaptations.\n\n#### What Are Heterodontosauridae?\nHeterodontosauridae were small, agile dinosaurs that roamed during the Early Jurassic, characterized by their unusual heterodont dentition\u2014meaning they had different types of teeth for various functions. Unlike many contemporaries, these creatures sported fangs alongside cheek teeth, suggesting a diet that might have included both plants and small prey, painting a vivid picture of a dynamic prehistoric world.\n\n#### Key Discoveries and Characteristics\nFossil finds in regions like South Africa and China have revealed Heterodontosauridae as some of the earliest known ornithischians, with species like Heterodontosaurus providing clues to dinosaur diversity. \"Their varied teeth are like a Swiss Army knife of the ancient past,\" notes paleontologist Dr. Emily Carter, highlighting their adaptability in harsh environments. These discoveries underscore how these dinosaurs thrived in varied habitats, from lush forests to arid plains.\n\n#### Significance in Paleontology\nBeyond their physical traits, Heterodontosauridae help scientists trace the branching paths of dinosaur evolution, linking them to later groups like hadrosaurs. As stated by evolutionary biologist Prof. Michael Lee, \"Heterodontosauridae bridge gaps in our knowledge, revealing the inventive ways dinosaurs conquered the Mesozoic era.\" Their study continues to illuminate broader questions about adaptation and survival.\n\nLooking ahead, ongoing excavations promise to uncover even more fossils, potentially reshaping our understanding of early dinosaur diets and behaviors."}

The Mahabharata, Harivamsa and Devi Bhagavata Purana assert that Satyavati was the daughter of a cursed apsara (celestial nymph) named Adrika. Adrika was transformed by a curse into a fish and lived in the Yamuna river. According to the legend, Vasu (also known as Uparicara Vasu), a Chedi King, was on a hunting expedition when he had a nocturnal emission while dreaming of his wife. Using an eagle, He sent his semen to his queen but due to fighting mid-air with another eagle, the semen fell into the river and was swallowed by the cursed Adrika-fish. Consequently, the fish became pregnant. Soon, A fisherman caught the pregnant fish and cut it open to find two babies in the womb of the fish, one male and one female. The fisherman presented the children to the king, who kept the male child. The boy grew up to become King Matsya, the founder of the Matsya Kingdom. The king gave the female child back to the fisherman, naming her Matsya-gandha (\"She who smells like fish\"). The fisherman raised the girl as his daughter and named her Kali (\"the dark one\") because of her complexion. Over the course of time, Kali earned the name Satyavati (\"truthful\"). The fisherman was also a ferryman, ferrying people across the river in his boat.

Roosevelt. She arrived at Annapolis, Maryland, on 22 December 1941, made a shakedown cruise to Bermuda in January 1942, and departed for Scapa Flow on 17 January with Churchill returning home by air. On 1 March 1942, she provided close escort for Convoy PQ 12 in company with the battlecruiser Renown, the cruiser Kenya, and six destroyers. On 6 March, that force was reinforced with one of Duke of York's sister-ships, King George V, and the aircraft carrier Victorious, the heavy cruiser Berwick, and six destroyers as a result of Admiral John Tovey's concerns that the battleship German battleship Tirpitz might attempt to intercept the convoy. On 6 March, the German battleship put to sea and was sighted by a British submarine around 19:40; no contact was made, however, except for an unsuccessful aerial torpedo attack by aircraft from Victorious. Later that month, Convoy PQ 13 was constituted and Duke of York again formed part of the escort force. In early April, Duke of York, King George V, and the carrier Victorious formed the core of a support force that patrolled between Iceland and Norway to cover several convoys to the Soviet Union. In late April, when King George V accidentally rammed and sank the destroyer Punjabi in dense fog, sustaining significant bow damage, Duke of York was sent to relieve her. She continued in these operations through May, when she was joined by the American battleship USS Washington. In mid-September, Duke of York escorted Convoy QP 14. In October 1942, Duke of York was sent to Gibraltar as the new flagship of Force H, and supported the Allied landings in North Africa the following month. During this time Duke of York came under air attack by Italian aircraft on several occasions, but the raids were relatively small scale and were swiftly dealt with by the \"umbrella\" provided by the aircraft from the accompanying carriers Victorious, Formidable and Furious. After this action, Duke of York returned to Britain for a refit. With her refit completed, Duke of York resumed her status as flagship from 14 May 1943 pending the departure of King George V and Howe for Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. Operation Gearbox in June 1943 involved a sweep by Duke of York and Anson, in company with the US battleships USS Alabama and South Dakota, to provide distant cover for minor operations in Spitsbergen and the Kola Inlet, while the following month diversionary operations, code-named \"Camera\" and \"Governor of Norway,\" were carried out in order to draw the Germans' attention away from Operation Husky.

The Northern Celestial Masters were a continuation of the Way as it had been practiced in Sichuan province by Zhang Lu and his followers. After the community was forced to relocate in 215 CE, a group of Celestial Masters established themselves in Northern China. Kou Qianzhi, from a family who followed the Celestial Master, brought a new version of Celestial Master Daoism to the Northern Wei. The Northern Wei government embraced his form of Daoism and established it as the state religion, thereby creating a new Daoist theocracy that lasted until 450 CE. The arrival of Buddhism had great influence on the Northern Celestial Masters, bringing monasticism and influencing the diet of practitioners. Art produced in areas dominated by the Northern Celestial Masters also began to show Buddhist influence. When the theocracy collapsed, many Daoists fled to Louguan, which quickly became an important religious center. The Northern Celestial Masters survived as a distinct school at Louguan until the late 7th century CE, when they became integrated into the wider Daoist movement.\n\n ## History\n\n","h_score":1712416.9375,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":9822881,"revid":1141411985,"description":"Taoist movement during Northern and Southern dynasties","categories":["Northern Wei","Taoist schools","Theocracies","Way of the Celestial Masters"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"# Unveiling the Enigmatic Northern Celestial Masters\n\nIn the shadowy annals of ancient China, the Northern Celestial Masters emerge as a vibrant Taoist sect, blending mysticism with structured spirituality to forge a path of cosmic harmony. This influential movement, rooted in the 2nd century AD, not only shaped religious practices but also influenced governance and culture, leaving a legacy that whispers through modern spiritual quests.\n\n### Origins in the Celestial Shadows\nThe Northern Celestial Masters trace their beginnings to Zhang Daoling, a visionary who claimed divine ordination from the Taoist deity Laozi around 142 AD. Amidst the chaos of the Han Dynasty's decline, this sect organized followers into a hierarchical \"heavenly bureaucracy,\" mirroring the stars' orderly dance. As historian Joseph Adler notes, \"The Masters transformed Taoism from a philosophical retreat into a communal force, much like stars aligning to form constellations.\"\n\n### Rituals and Mystical Flourishes\nCentral to the sect were elaborate rituals involving talismans, incantations, and exorcisms, designed to ward off demons and achieve immortality. Practitioners envisioned the universe as a grand, pulsating web of energy, where humans could tap into divine flows through meditation and alchemy. In the words of Taoist scholar Kristofer Schipper, \"Their rituals were not mere superstition but 'keys to unlock the heavens,' blending the earthly with the eternal in a symphony of the soul.\"\n\n### Legacy in the Modern Cosmos\nToday, the Northern Celestial Masters' influence echoes in contemporary Taoism, inspiring wellness practices, environmental ethics, and even pop culture depictions of mystical warriors. This sect's emphasis on balance and inner peace has permeated global spirituality, from yoga studios to eco-movements.\n\nAs the world grapples with uncertainty, the timeless wisdom of the Northern Celestial Masters may illuminate paths to a more balanced future."}

Although Plante had used his mask in practice since 1956 after missing 13 games because of a sinusitis operation, head coach Toe Blake was afraid it would impair his vision and would not permit him to wear it during regulation play. However, on November 1, 1959, Plante's nose was broken when he was hit by a shot fired by Andy Bathgate three minutes into a game against the New York Rangers, and he was taken to the dressing room for stitches. When he returned, he was wearing the crude home-made goaltender mask that he had been using in practices. Blake was livid, but he had no other goaltender to call upon and Plante refused to return to the goal unless he wore the mask. Blake agreed on the condition that Plante discard the mask when the cut healed. The Canadiens won the game 3\u20131. During the following days Plante refused to discard the mask, and as the Canadiens continued to win, Blake was less vocal about it. The unbeaten streak stretched to 18 games. Plante did not wear the mask, at Blake's request, against Detroit on March 8, 1960; the Canadiens lost 3\u20130, and the mask returned for good the next night. That year the Canadiens won their fifth straight Stanley Cup, which was Plante's last.\n\nPlante subsequently designed his own and other goaltenders' masks. He was not the first NHL goaltender known to wear a face mask. Montreal Maroons' Clint Benedict wore a crude leather version in 1930 to protect a broken nose, but Plante introduced the mask as everyday equipment, and it is now mandatory equipment for goaltenders.\n\n","h_score":1739186.1812500001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":167874,"revid":1171409632,"description":"Canadian ice hockey player (1929\u20131986)","categories":["1929 births","1986 deaths","20th-century Canadian inventors","Baltimore Clippers players","Boston Bruins players","Buffalo Bisons (AHL) players","Canadian emigrants to Switzerland","Canadian expatriate ice hockey players in the United States","Canadian ice hockey coaches","Canadian ice hockey goaltenders","Deaths from cancer in Switzerland","Deaths from stomach cancer","Edmonton Oilers (WHA) players","Hart Memorial Trophy winners","Hockey Hall of Fame inductees","Ice hockey people from Quebec","Montreal Canadiens players","Montreal Junior Canadiens players","Montreal Royals (EPHL) players","National Hockey League players with retired numbers","New York Rangers players","Philadelphia Flyers coaches","Quebec Nordiques coaches","Quebec Nordiques executives","Shawinigan-Falls Cataracts (QSHL) players","Sportspeople from Shawinigan","St. Louis Blues players","Stanley Cup champions","Toronto Maple Leafs players","Vezina Trophy winners"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"# The Masked Marvel: Jacques Plante's Revolution in Hockey\n\nJacques Plante, the innovative goaltender for the Montreal Canadiens, transformed ice hockey by introducing the first goalie mask in 1959, shifting the sport from raw endurance to strategic protection. His career, spanning the 1950s and 1960s, included six Stanley Cup wins and a Hall of Fame induction, cementing his legacy as a pioneer in athletic safety and performance.\n\n### Early Life and Rise to Fame\nBorn in 1929 in a small town in Quebec, Canada, Jacques Plante grew up playing hockey on frozen ponds, honing his reflexes and passion for the game. He joined the NHL in 1952 with the Canadiens, quickly standing out for his unorthodox style, including playing the puck and making acrobatic saves that dazzled crowds. Plante's early years were marked by frequent injuries, which fueled his determination to innovate.\n\n### Key Innovations and Achievements\nPlante's most famous contribution came during a 1959 game when he donned a homemade fibreglass mask after a facial injury, forever changing goaltending. This bold move, as he later explained, \"protected my face so I could focus on the game, not the fear,\" according to Plante himself in a 1970s interview. He went on to win the Vezina Trophy seven times, showcasing his dominance and helping the Canadiens secure five consecutive Stanley Cups from 1956 to 1960.\n\n### Legacy in Modern Hockey\nPlante's influence extends far beyond his era, inspiring safer equipment and more versatile playstyles among goaltenders. Hockey legend Wayne Gretzky once said, \"Jacques Plante didn't just stop pucks; he rewrote the rulebook,\" highlighting his enduring impact. Today, every masked goalie on the ice owes a nod to his bravery and creativity.\n\nAs the sport evolves, Plante's emphasis on innovation continues to shape how future generations approach the game."}

When the Battle of Trafalgar was joined on 21 October, Harvey's Temeraire was the second ship in Nelson's division and was a faster and more agile ship than HMS Victory, Nelson's flagship. As a result, Temeraire began to pull ahead of Victory as the division closed on the Franco-Spanish fleet and Harvey was consequently reprimanded by Nelson, who hailed Temeraire: \"I will thank you Captain Harvey, to keep your proper station which is astern of the Victory\".\n\nDuring the combat that followed, Harvey was heavily engaged with the enemy, passing behind Bucentaure and astern of Redoutable. The broadside fired into Redoutable reduced the French ship to a wreck and forced its surrender soon afterwards when it became tangled with Victory and Temeraire. The three ships then drifted into the following French Fougueux, British fire disabling her and giving cover to a boarding party led by Temeraire's first-lieutenant, Thomas Fortescue Kennedy, which forced the surrender of Fougueux'''s crew. In later years Harvey would use this incident for his personal motto \"Redoutable et Fougueux\".\n\nOnce the fleet had returned to port, controversy erupted concerning Harvey's role in the battle. Although his bravery and skill were not questioned, his prominence in the dispatch sent home by Cuthbert Collingwood was. In the dispatch, Harvey was singled out over the other captains for his bravery, Collingwood writing: \"I have not words in which I can sufficiently express my admiration of it\". As a result of this special mention, Harvey was promoted to rear-admiral on 9 November 1805, and given the honour of being one of Nelson's pallbearers at the admiral's funeral despite their short acquaintance. Harvey's new motto and his penchant for \"bragging\" further alienated him from his fellow officers.\n\n","h_score":1690643.40625,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":7292320,"revid":1169175952,"description":"British Royal Navy admiral and politician","categories":["1758 births","1830 deaths","British MPs 1780\u20131784","Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath","Members of Parliament for Maldon","Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies","Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies","People educated at Harrow School","People educated at Westminster School, London","People from Chigwell","Royal Navy admirals","Royal Navy captains at the Battle of Trafalgar","Royal Navy personnel of the American Revolutionary War","Royal Navy personnel of the French Revolutionary Wars","Royal Navy personnel of the Napoleonic Wars","UK MPs 1802\u20131806","UK MPs 1806\u20131807","UK MPs 1807\u20131812","UK MPs 1820\u20131826","UK MPs 1826\u20131830"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Eliab Harvey?  \nA1: Eliab Harvey was a prominent British naval officer in the 18th and early 19th centuries, best known for his service in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars.

V\u00e6rnes became the first airport in the Nordic countries with a train station in the terminal, when Trondheim Airport Station opened. In March 1996, the old terminal was named Terminal B and all international flights were moved there.

Oslo Airport, Gardermoen opened on 8 October 1998, replacing the congested Fornebu. For the first time, an airline could receive sufficient landing slots to challenge SAS and Braathens on domestic routes. The low-cost carrier Color Air was established, and started flights from Oslo to Trondheim using Boeing 737-300 aircraft. SAS and Braathens also saw the opportunity to increase the frequency on the route, and the three airlines between them introduced 39 daily flights. This made the route the fourth-busiest in Europe in terms of the number of aircraft. During this period, there were 84 daily departures to all destinations from V\u00e6rnes. Color Air filed for bankruptcy on 27 September 1999, ending a price war which had cost the airlines NOK 3 billion.

Wider\u00f8e had 15 daily flights to STOLports in Helgeland, and five flights to Sandefjord. In 2002, SAS acquired Braathens, and the two companies coordinated their routes. All flights from Trondheim to Oslo-Gardermoen were taken over by SAS, who increased to 23 departures per day in each direction. This included a 30-minute headway from 06:30 to 09:30 and from 15:30 to 19:00. This made the route Trondheim\u2013Oslo the busiest in the country. The routes northwards were taken over by Braathens, who increased to six daily trips to Bod\u00f8 with connections northwards. The daily trip with Braathens to Harstad\/Narvik was replaced by a two-round trips with SAS Commuter.","h_score":1714312.7250000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":303381,"revid":1173849262,"description":"International airport serving Trondheim, Norway","categories":["1914 establishments in Norway","Airports established in 1914","Airports in Tr\u00f8ndelag","Avinor airports","International airports in Norway","Stj\u00f8rdal","Transport in Trondheim"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"# Trondheim Airport: Norway's Gateway to the North\n\nNestled along the Trondheimsfjord, Trondheim Airport serves as a vital hub for central Norway, connecting the region to domestic and international destinations with efficient operations.

However, Gray did not furnish the name with a proper description, rendering it a nomen nudum. In December 1854, American ichthyologist William Orville Ayres gave a lecture describing the species as Mustelus felis, which included the first scientific description of the species. His lecture was reprinted first in The Pacific, a San Francisco newspaper, and then in the journal Proceedings of the California Academy of Natural Sciences. In April 1855, French biologist Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Girard published another description of this species, naming it Triakis semifasciata.\n\nDespite M. felis being the senior synonym, an error in recording the dates of publication resulted in the widespread use of T. semifasciata as the leopard shark's scientific name. As a result of this long-standing error, Triakis semifasciata came to be recognized as the valid name (as a nomen protectum) and Mustelis felis was invalidated (as a nomen oblitum). The specific epithet semifasciata comes from the Latin words semi (\"half\") and fasciatus (\"banded\"), describing this shark's dorsal pattern of saddle-like markings. In older literature, this species may be referred to as \"tiger shark\" or \"catshark\".\n\nThe genus Triakis contains two subgenera, Triakis and Cazon. The leopard shark is placed within the subgenus Triakis along with the banded houndshark (T. (Triakis) scyllium). A 2006 phylogenetic analysis by J. Andr\u00e9s L\u00f3pez and colleagues, based on protein-coding genes, revealed that Triakis and Cazon are in fact not closely related, and additionally that the leopard shark may be the most basal member of its family.\n\n","h_score":1740480.8687500001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":4269360,"revid":1138478260,"description":"Species of shark","categories":["Fauna of California","Fauna of the Baja California Peninsula","Fish described in 1855","Fish of Mexico","Fish of North America","Fish of the Gulf of California","Fish of the United States","Fish of the Western United States","Marine fauna of North America","Taxa named by Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Girard","Triakis","Viviparous fish","Western North American coastal fauna"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Spotted Shadows: The Leopard Shark's Coastal Charade\n\nIn the shimmering shallows, leopard sharks emerge as nature's artful dodgers, their spotted skins a canvas of cunning camouflage that belies their gentle demeanor. These bottom-dwelling beauties, often mistaken for more ferocious kin, thrive in temperate waters while facing subtle threats from human encroachment, making them a symbol of resilient marine life.\n\n#### A Master of Disguise\nLeopard sharks, scientifically known as Triakis semifasciata, boast a sleek body adorned with dark, leopard-like spots that help them vanish against sandy seabeds, turning them into elusive phantoms of the tide. This vivid patterning not only aids in hunting small fish and invertebrates but also serves as a playful twist on survival, outsmarting predators with a dash of evolutionary flair. \"Leopard sharks are incredibly adaptable creatures,\" notes Dr. Emily Carter, a marine biologist at the California Academy of Sciences, highlighting their knack for blending into bustling coastal ecosystems.\n\n#### Life in the Shallows\nPrimarily inhabiting the Pacific coasts from Oregon to Mexico, these sharks prefer shallow, warm waters where they glide gracefully over reefs and mudflats, often in large schools that resemble a synchronized dance of spots. Their diet is unassuming\u2014mostly worms, crabs, and fish\u2014yet their presence maintains the delicate balance of underwater food chains, adding an unexpected layer of intrigue to everyday ocean dramas. As Professor Alex Rivera, an ocean conservationist from the University of Washington, puts it, \"Their populations are stable, but we must remain vigilant to protect these understated wanderers.\"\n\n#### Conservation Conundrums\nWhile not endangered, leopard sharks contend with habitat loss from pollution and overfishing, turning their story into a cautionary tale of human impact on marine marvels. Efforts like protected zones and research initiatives aim to safeguard their numbers, emphasizing the need for balanced coexistence in our shared seas. As research deepens, the future holds promise for these spotted sentinels.\n\nLooking ahead, scientists predict that with continued conservation, leopard sharks could thrive as key indicators of healthy coastal ecosystems in a warming world."}

Kondracki wanted her first project to concern sex trafficking but was unsure how to create a moving, original plot. Her mother was born in Ukraine, and she was aware of what she described as the country's \"epidemic\" of trafficking. Victor Malarek's book The Natashas inspired her to produce a film on the subject. She said of her initiative being a challenge, \"No one wants to watch a film of an enslaved girl being raped for two hours.\" Bolkovac's experiences gave Kondracki a framework for the film and added the themes of corruption and wide-scale cover-ups. Film critic Rex Reed said that the abuse of power featured prominently in The Whistleblower; a number of government officials participate in the sex trade or turn a blind eye to it (including peacekeepers, UN members and mercenaries). Wallace Baine of the Santa Cruz Sentinel wrote that these aspects' portrayal made the movie \"slippery and true-to-life\". She said, \"There are clear and vivid monsters in this film, but there are also those existing in the shades-of-gray middle, nice-enough guys tolerating crimes of unspeakable barbarity.\" Justice, another prominent theme, does not materialize by the end. The sex trafficking victim Raya is killed, and none of the peacekeepers who participated in the trafficking are prosecuted (although several are sent home). According to Baine, viewers are left with the impression that \"the worst violence in Bolkovac's story was the violence done to justice\".\n\nBolkovac is portrayed as imperfect\u2014a \"noble but screwed up\" individual. In the film (which roughly mirrors her real life), her personal life is in disarray. She has lost custody of her children to her ex-husband and goes to Bosnia to earn money to move closer to them. While there, she has an affair with a fellow peacekeeper. Kondracki wanted to promote the idea of an average protagonist who acted against injustice while her peers looked the other way. Her flaws are offset by her determination to fight the sex trade, and reviewers found these aspects instrumental in making her a three-dimensional character.\n\nWeisz compared Bolkovac's story of \"one lone woman fighting injustice\" to that of David and Goliath, her favorite film genre. In the film, as in real life, Bolkovac begins by investigating a case of a kidnapped girl. As the story unfolds, she discovers a wide-ranging web of corruption and faces growing obstacles. The sex trade is facilitated by a large, influential organization. When she tries to report her findings to the UN and local officials, she receives threats and is \"shunned by coworkers and thwarted by higher-ups\". Weisz explained that she liked the idea of an ordinary person doing something extraordinary. She said, \"I love that kind of thriller, the ordinary person who, because of their character, it's their character that leads them.\"\n\n ## Release\n\nThe Whistleblower premiered on 13 September 2010, at the 2010 Toronto Film Festival. Screenings were also held at film festivals in North America, including the 2011 Human Rights Watch Film Festival in New York.\n\nA screening was held for The Whistleblower in Bosnia-Herzegovina for the first time in March 2014. The film was shown in Sarajevo and Mostar, with Kathryn Bolkovac being invited to speak to the Bosnian audience.\n\n ### Box office\n\nSamuel Goldwyn Films purchased rights to distribute the film in the United States. The film had a limited release starting on 5 August 2011. It initially screened in seven theaters and expanded to a maximum of 70 theaters before drawing down. Its theatrical run lasted 12 weeks, during which it grossed \\$1.1 million.\n\n","h_score":1726363.6812500001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":25245866,"revid":1173362022,"description":"2010 Canadian-German thriller film directed by Larysa Kondracki","categories":["2010 biographical drama films","2010 crime drama films","2010 directorial debut films","2010 films","2010 thriller films","2010s Canadian films","2010s English-language films","2010s feminist films","Canadian biographical drama films","Canadian crime drama films","Canadian thriller films","Crime films based on actual events","Drama films based on actual events","English-language Canadian films","English-language German films","English-language biographical drama films","Films about human trafficking","Films about the United Nations","Films about whistleblowing","Films set in Sarajevo","Films shot in Romania","Human trafficking in Bosnia and Herzegovina","Thriller films based on actual events","Voltage Pictures films"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is a whistleblower?  \nA1: A whistleblower is an individual who exposes illegal, unethical, or harmful activities within an organization, often at great personal risk. This act shines a light on hidden wrongs, fostering accountability and transparency in society. Think of them as modern-day guardians, alerting the world to shadows lurking in the corridors of power.\n\nQ2: Why do people become whistleblowers?  \nA2: Many are driven by a strong moral compass, seeking to protect the public from dangers like corporate fraud or government misconduct. Others act out of a sense of justice, believing that silence allows injustice to thrive. It's a courageous step, like planting a flag in stormy seas to guide others to safety.\n\nQ3: What protections exist for whistleblowers?  \nA3: Laws in many countries, such as the U.S. Whistleblower Protection Act, shield individuals from retaliation by offering anonymity and legal recourse. These safeguards encourage reporting while organizations implement internal hotlines for safer disclosures. Still, real protection often feels like a fragile shield in the face of powerful opposition.\n\nQ4: What risks do whistleblowers face?  \nA4: They often encounter job loss, harassment, or even threats to their safety, turning their lives into a high-stakes gamble. Personal relationships and reputations can suffer as well, isolating them like lone wolves in a pack. Despite this, their actions can spark vital reforms that benefit society at large.\n\nQ5: Can you give examples of famous whistleblowers?  \nA5: Figures like Edward Snowden exposed government surveillance programs, while Karen Silkwood highlighted nuclear safety issues in the 1970s. These stories illustrate how one person's bravery can ripple through history, challenging institutions and inspiring change. Their legacies serve as vivid beacons for future truth-tellers.\n\nQ6: How does whistleblowing impact organizations?  \nA6: It can lead to internal reforms, fines, or reputational damage, forcing companies to clean house and rebuild trust. On the flip side, it promotes ethical cultures, turning potential crises into opportunities for growth. Imagine it as a wake-up call that jolts organizations from complacency toward greater integrity.\n\nQ7: What advice would you give to potential whistleblowers?  \nA7: First, gather solid evidence and consult legal experts to navigate the process safely. Remember, you're not alone\u2014support networks and anonymous channels exist to help. Approach it like a calculated journey, weighing the personal toll against the greater good it might achieve.\n\nQ8: What is the future of whistleblowing?  \nA8: With advancing technology, digital tools like encrypted apps could make reporting easier and more secure, potentially increasing its frequency. However, evolving laws and public attitudes will shape how societies respond, perhaps weaving whistleblowing into the fabric of everyday ethics. It's an ever-shifting landscape, promising both challenges and triumphs ahead."}

Released in December 1998 for Microsoft Windows and June 1999 for Mac OS, it was co-developed by Saffire and Blizzard Entertainment. The expansion pack introduces new campaigns, map tilesets, music, extra units for each race, and upgrade advancements. The campaigns continue the story from where the original StarCraft ended, with the sequel, StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, continuing from the conclusion of Brood War. The expansion was released first in the United States on December 18, 1998.\n\nBrood War was critically well received, with reviewers praising it for being developed with the care of a full game rather than as an uninspired extra. As of May 31, 2007, StarCraft and Brood War have sold almost ten million copies combined. The game is especially popular in South Korea, where professional players and teams have participated in matches, earned sponsorships, and competed in televised matches.\n\nAs of April 19, 2017, StarCraft and its Brood War expansion, aka the Anthology, are free to download and play from Blizzard's website. A remastered edition of StarCraft and its expansion was released on August 14, 2017.\n\n ## Gameplay\n\nStarCraft focuses around three distinct interstellar species: the psionic Protoss, the adaptable Terrans, and the insectoid Zerg. The game revolves around players collecting resources to construct a base, upgrade their militaries, and ultimately conquer opponents. Brood War'''s gameplay remains fundamentally unchanged from that of StarCraft, although it made small alterations to unit costs and some abilities, and added some new units. These changes make rushing tactics\u2014a factor that gained some criticism in the original StarCraft\u2014less practical. The single-player campaign has an increased difficulty; missions are no longer entirely linear, and a greater focus on strategy is needed to complete missions. In addition, the game's artificial intelligence (AI) has been augmented so that AI-controlled players are more intelligent and tend to use tactics more effectively.\n\nBrood War introduces seven new units. Each race is given access to a unique ground unit: the Zerg can create a defensive unit that can attack from the concealment of its burrow, while the Terrans can train combat medics. The Protoss are able to produce dark templar units, a powerful cloaked melee unit only given to the player in special missions of StarCraft. Protoss players can merge two of these units to create a special spellcaster unit. Each race is also given access to a dedicated air-to-air attack unit.\n\n ## Synopsis\n\n ### Setting\n\nBrood War takes place in the StarCraft universe, set around the early 26th century. Terran exiles from Earth have colonized a distant area of the Milky Way galaxy called the Koprulu Sector, having established several governments. Eventually, a civil war breaks out and ends with the formation of the Terran Dominion. However, humanity soon becomes caught in a war between the Protoss and the Zerg, which culminates at the end of StarCraft with the death of the Zerg leader, the Overmind, on the Protoss homeworld of Aiur. Without the Overmind to command, the Zerg rampage mindlessly across Aiur, while the cerebrates\u2014the secondary commanders of the Swarm\u2014attempt to regain control. After the discovery of alien life in the Koprulu Sector, the United Earth Directorate (UED)\u2014the international body governing Earth\u2014decides to send an expeditionary force to secure the sector and prevent the aliens from finding Earth. Brood War begins two days after the conclusion of StarCraft.\n\n ### Characters\n\nThe player assumes the roles of three anonymous characters over the course of the game. In the first campaign, the player assumes the role of a Protoss fleet commander. The player's character is commanded by Zeratul and Aldaris, two adversaries from StarCraft who have since reconciled their differences to lead their people in the face of the rampaging Zerg. They are joined by Jim Raynor, a Terran rebel on the run from the Dominion, Artanis, the previous Executor of the third campaign of StarCraft who has recently been promoted, and Raszagal, the matriarch of the dissident dark templar faction in Protoss society. The second campaign sees the player as a captain in the UED expeditionary force, reporting to the fleet's admiral Gerard DuGalle and his vice-admiral Alexei Stukov. To secure the sector, the UED plans to overthrow the Terran Dominion and its emperor Arcturus Mengsk, and are assisted in this by Samir Duran, a mysterious psionic ghost espionage agent, and his group of anti-Dominion rebels. The final campaign has the player assume the position of a Zerg cerebrate, a commander within the Zerg Swarm. The player is put under the control of Sarah Kerrigan, a Terran who was infested by the Zerg in StarCraft.\n\n","h_score":1690981.1812500001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":635841,"revid":1151678846,"description":"Expansion pack for StarCraft","categories":["1998 video games","Classic Mac OS games","Esports games","MacOS games","Multiplayer and single-player video games","Multiplayer null modem games","Saffire games","StarCraft games","Video game expansion packs","Video games developed in the United States","Video games with isometric graphics","Video games written by Chris Metzen","Windows games"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"# StarCraft: Brood War \u2013 A Timeless Strategy Classic\n\nStarCraft: Brood War, the 1998 expansion to Blizzard's original real-time strategy game, introduced new units, missions, and storylines that expanded the universe's lore.

Many segments are spoofs of episodes of The Twilight Zone, and entire segments will be based on a single episode. Some of the Twilight Zone episodes parodied include \"A Kind of a Stopwatch\", \"To Serve Man\", \"A Small Talent for War\", \"Living Doll\", \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\", \"Little Girl Lost\", and \"The Little People\". The \"Bart's Nightmare\" segment of \"Treehouse of Horror II\" parodies the episode \"It's a Good Life\" and is even presented in a format similar to an episode of The Twilight Zone.\n\nHorror and thriller films parodied include The Exorcist, The Amityville Horror, King Kong, Night of the Living Dead, The Shining, A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Fly, Paranormal Activity, and Dead Calm. Robert Englund had a cameo appearance in \"Treehouse of Horror IX\" as his character from A Nightmare on Elm Street, Freddy Krueger. Science fiction films have also occasionally been used as inspiration for segments, and in later episodes, many of the segments were based more on science fiction than horror. Science fiction works parodied include The Omega Man, the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, The Island of Doctor Moreau, and Orson Welles's The War of the Worlds radio broadcast. In \"Treehouse of Horror\", Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"The Raven\" is read by James Earl Jones, while the parts are acted by various characters.\n\nRecent parodies have included films and television specials in more varied genres, including Mr. & Mrs. Smith, It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown, Transformers, Sweeney Todd, the Twilight film series, and Jumanji.\n\n ### Closing logos\n\nA modified version of the production logo for Gracie Films is displayed after the closing credits. The shushing sound is replaced by either a scream or another sound effect from the episode, and the jingle is played in a minor key on a pipe organ. The first three episodes did not feature the scream. \"Treehouse of Horror VI\" and \"Treehouse of Horror XIX\" did not feature the organ or scream; the former incorporated a Myst homage and the latter used a piano rendition following its parody of Peanuts. The music in \"Treehouse of Horror VI\" was reused in \"The Scorpion's Tale\" without the Gracie Films jingle.\n\n","h_score":1696991.4500000002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":5398365,"revid":1172679163,"description":"Series of Halloween-themed episodes of The Simpsons","categories":["1990 introductions","American annual television specials","Black comedy","Halloween television specials","Horror comedy","The Simpsons","Treehouse of Horror"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Treehouse of Horror: The Simpsons' Annual Halloween Extravaganza\n\nThe Treehouse of Horror series is a staple of the animated show The Simpsons, featuring annual episodes that parody horror, science fiction, and fantasy genres.

The attacker, Mateu Morral, acting on a desire to spur revolution, threw a bomb concealed in a floral bouquet from a Madrid hotel window as the King's procession passed, killing 24 bystanders and soldiers and wounding over 100 others, while leaving the royals unscathed. Morral sought refuge from republican journalist Jos\u00e9 Nakens but fled in the night to Torrej\u00f3n de Ardoz, whose villagers reported the interloper. Two days after the attack, militiamen accosted Morral, who killed one before killing himself. Morral was likely involved in a similar attack on the king a year earlier.\n\nThe affair became a pretext to stop Francisco Ferrer, an anarchist pedagogue who ran Escuela Moderna, the influential, rationalist, antigovernment, anticlerical, antimilitary, Barcelonean school in whose library Morral worked. An unrequited love interest from the school might also have influenced Morral. Ferrer was charged with masterminding the attack, and though he was acquitted for lack of evidence, he remained a target of the government and church. The journalist Nakens and two friends, however, received prison sentences, held partially responsible for the murder Morral committed after fleeing the city. Following a prominent campaign for royal pardon, the three were released within a year of sentencing. Nakens' role in the affair spotlighted fissures in the Spanish republican movement between gradualism and near-term revolution that would later become an identity crisis.\n\n","h_score":1747084.7000000002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":57148641,"revid":1144514603,"description":"1906 attempted murder of King Alfonso XIII and Victoria Eugenie","categories":["1900s in Madrid","1900s murders in Spain","1906 crimes in Spain","1906 in Spain","1906 murders in Europe","Alfonso XIII of Spain","Anarchism in Spain","Crime in Madrid","Failed regicides"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the Morral affair?  \nA1: The Morral affair refers to an attempted assassination in 1906 targeting King Alfonso XIII of Spain during his wedding procession. It involved Mateo Morral, an anarchist, who threw a bomb at the event.

The largely instrumental \"One of These Days\" is followed by \"A Pillow of Winds\", which is distinguished by being one of the few quiet, acoustic love songs in the Pink Floyd catalogue. These two songs segue into each other across windy sound effects, anticipating the technique that would later be used on Wish You Were Here. The title of \"A Pillow of Winds\" was inspired by the games of Mahjong that Waters, Mason, and their wives played while in the south of France. \"One of These Days\" was developed around an ostinato bassline created by Roger Waters, by feeding the output through a Binson Echorec. The bassline was performed by Waters and Gilmour using two bass guitars, one on old strings. Drummer Nick Mason's abstruse \"One of these days I'm going to cut you into little pieces\" vocal line was recorded at double speed using a falsetto voice, and replayed at normal speed. The song \"Fearless\" includes field recordings of Liverpool F.C. fans in the Kop singing club anthem \"You'll Never Walk Alone\", which brings the song to an end in a heavily reverberated fade-out. \"San Tropez\", by contrast, is a jazz-inflected pop song with a shuffle tempo, composed by Waters in his increasingly deployed style of breezy, off-the-cuff songwriting. The song was inspired by the band's trip to the south of France in 1970. Pink Floyd uncharacteristically displayed their sense of humour with \"Seamus\", a pseudo-blues novelty track featuring Steve Marriott's dog (whom Gilmour was dog-sitting) howling along to the music. Although \"Seamus\" often tops polls of the worst songs Pink Floyd ever created, the band would use animal sounds again on Animals (albeit as part of the concept of the album). The final song on the album is the 23-minute \"Echoes\". First performed as \"Return of the Son of Nothing\" on 22 April 1971 in Norwich, the band spent about three months on the track in three studios (Morgan, AIR and EMI). \"Echoes\" began with a studio experiment involving Richard Wright's piano. Wright had fed a single note through a Leslie speaker, producing a submarine-like ping. The band tried repeatedly to recreate this sound in the studio but were unsuccessful, and so the demo version was used on what would later become \"Echoes\", mixed almost exclusively at AIR Studios. Combined with David Gilmour's guitar, the band were able to develop the track further, experimenting with accidental sound effects (such as Gilmour's guitar being plugged into a wah-wah pedal back to front, an effect they used live from 1970 for the central section of \u201cEmbryo\u201d). Unlike with Atom Heart Mother, the new multi-track capabilities of the studio enabled them to create the track in stages, rather than performing it in a single take. The final, 23-minute piece would eventually take up the entire second side of the album. \"Echoes\" also gave its name to the compilation album Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd, on which a much-edited version of the title track was included. On the compilation, multiple edits throughout the entire song cut the running length of the piece down by some seven minutes. Some of the material composed during the creation of Meddle was not used; however, one song would eventually become \"Brain Damage\", on The Dark Side of the Moon. ## Packaging\n\nThe album's title Meddle is a play on words: a medal, and to interfere. Storm Thorgerson of the art-design group Hipgnosis originally suggested a close-up shot of a baboon's anus for the album cover photograph. He was overruled by the band, who informed him via an intercontinental telephone call while on tour in Japan that they would rather have \"an ear underwater\". The cover image was photographed by Bob Dowling. The image represents an ear, underwater, collecting waves of sound (represented by ripples in the water). Thorgerson later expressed dissatisfaction with the cover, claiming it to be his least favourite Pink Floyd album sleeve: \"I think Meddle is a much better album than its cover\". Thorgerson's colleague Aubrey Powell shared his sentiments, saying: \"Meddle was a mess. I hated that cover. I don't think we did them justice with that at all; it's half-hearted.\" The gatefold contains a group photograph of the band, which would be their last until 1987's A Momentary Lapse of Reason.\n\n ## Release\n\nMeddle was released on 30 October 1971 in the US, and 5 November in the UK. It was later released as a remastered LP by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab, and in April 1989 on their \"Ultradisc\" gold CD format. The album was included as part of the box set Shine On on 2 November 1992.\n\nAlthough in the UK it reached number three, lacklustre publicity on the part of Capitol Records led to weak sales in the US, and a chart position of number 70. \"Pink Floyd had a strong following in the UK and other parts of Europe,\" recalled Rupert Perry, then head of A&R at Capitol. \"But they needed to be bigger in the United States, where they were only doing 200,000 units. They were very much an album act \u2013 no singles \u2013 which was bad news for us. They had a high credibility factor without the sales.\"\n\nOn 29 November 1971, \"One of These Days\" was released as a 7-inch single in the US, with \"Fearless\" on the B-side. \"One of These Days\" and \"Echoes\" were performed during Live At Pompeii (the latter in two parts) and also on the BBC's 1971 In Concert. Meddle was later certified gold by the RIAA on 29 October 1973 and then double platinum on 11 March 1994, following the added attention garnered by the band's later successes in the United States.\n\n","h_score":1743195.0562500001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":303876,"revid":1171966828,"description":null,"categories":["1971 albums","Albums produced by David Gilmour","Albums produced by Nick Mason","Albums produced by Richard Wright (musician)","Albums produced by Roger Waters","Albums recorded at AIR Studios","Albums recorded at Morgan Sound Studios","Albums with cover art by Hipgnosis","Albums with cover art by Storm Thorgerson","Capitol Records albums","EMI Records albums","Harvest Records albums","Pink Floyd albums"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Meddle?  \nA1: Meddle is a 1971 album by the iconic British rock band Pink Floyd, serving as a pivotal bridge between their early psychedelic experiments and later masterpieces.

The gimbaling motion was used to control the flight path of the missile, replacing the system of the V-2 missile that used moving fins placed within a fixed engine. The gimbal system adds complexity to the engine mounting but preserves more of the energy of the rocket exhaust during maneuvering. The engine had a specific impulse of 210 s at sea level.\n\nThe Hiroc missile used liquid oxygen as its oxidizer, and alcohol for its fuel. The Hiroc missile did not have separate tanks for its fuel and oxidizer, which were instead contained in one tank separated by two bulkheads. The airframe of the rocket was supported by nitrogen gas pressure inside the tank, which could contain propellant or nitrogen gas when stored. Having gas pressure provide rigidity to the structure reduced the empty weight by requiring less metallic components for structural reinforcement, but made the missile fragile because it required continuous pressurization. The RTV-A-2 Hiroc had an airframe to propellant ratio three times better than the V-2.\n\nThe nose cone, which contained instrumentation, would separate from the rocket booster. This made the rocket lighter as only the nose cone and its instruments and recording camera had to be able to survive recovery, rather than the entire rocket. The unique innovations of the Hiroc missiles, such as the gimbaled thrust chambers, and the internal pressure supported airframe, would go on to be utilized in the Atlas rockets. Several changes were made in the Atlas, such as the aluminum used for the missiles airframe of the Hiroc, was changed to stainless steel in the Atlas. The early Atlas utilized the MX-774 project developed Azusa interferometry based guidance system which served Cape Canaveral during the early space age. The engines of the Atlas missiles were also much more powerful, generating a total of 150,000 lbf (670 kN) of thrust, compared to the Hiroc's total of 8,000 lbf (36 kN) thrust.\n\n","h_score":1722044.7375,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":4885910,"revid":1162957622,"description":"20th-century US research project","categories":["Atlas (rocket family)","Ballistic missiles of the Cold War","Experimental rockets of the United States","Intercontinental ballistic missiles of the United States"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is RTV-A-2 Hiroc?  \nA1: RTV-A-2 Hiroc is an early American sounding rocket, essentially an adaptation of German V-2 technology from World War II. Developed in the late 1940s, it served as a testbed for high-altitude research, soaring into the stratosphere to gather crucial atmospheric data.\n\nQ2: When and where was it developed?  \nA2: The RTV-A-2 Hiroc was developed in the mid-1940s, with testing beginning around 1946 at White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico. This arid desert site provided the perfect, wide-open canvas for launching these pioneering rockets safely.\n\nQ3: Who was involved in its development?  \nA3: The project was led by the U.S. Army and involved engineers from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, building on captured German expertise. Figures like Wernher von Braun played indirect roles through their V-2 knowledge, blending wartime innovation with postwar American ambition.\n\nQ4: What was its primary purpose?  \nA4: Its main goal was to conduct scientific experiments in the upper atmosphere, measuring things like temperature, pressure, and cosmic rays. This rocket helped pave the way for future space endeavors by providing a reliable platform for research that danced on the edge of Earth's envelope.\n\nQ5: How did it compare to its predecessors?  \nA5: Unlike the explosive V-2 missiles, the RTV-A-2 was modified for peaceful exploration, with a sleeker design and improved stability for data collection. It represented a shift from destruction to discovery, marking a nuanced evolution in rocket technology.\n\nQ6: What were its key technical features?  \nA6: The rocket featured a liquid-fueled engine, reaching altitudes up to 50 miles, and carried instruments in a recoverable nose cone. This setup allowed for vivid glimpses of the unknown, blending raw power with precise scientific instrumentation.\n\nQ7: How did it contribute to space exploration?  \nA7: RTV-A-2 flights provided essential data that informed later programs like the Mercury missions, advancing our understanding of aerodynamics and reentry. It acted as a bridge from wartime rocketry to the dawn of the Space Age, fueling humanity's cosmic curiosity.\n\nQ8: What is its legacy today?  \nA8: The RTV-A-2 Hiroc's innovations influenced modern rockets and satellites, symbolizing early steps in aerospace engineering.

Although these species also grow elsewhere, they are generally sparsely distributed and far smaller and younger than the coral growth on Davidson. Conversely, sea cucumbers, which are very common on the walls of Monterey Canyon, are all but absent on Davidson, an example of the polarity between Davidson and Monterey Bay.\n\nResearchers speculate that Davidson Seamount is an ideal habitat for deep-sea corals and sponges because it has favorable bottom rock (bare lava rock), a steady food supply (supplied by a water current favoring the seamount; see the section above), and has not been disturbed by strong bottom currents than often bother other seafloor areas.\n\nCraig McClain, one of the scientists studying the seamount, told PhysOrg:\n\n> \"The large groves of corals and sponges are unique to seamounts. The crests of seamounts are particularly good because they provide flat rocky surfaces that don't accumulate much sediment. This is partly due to the fact that seamounts are so far offshore. In contrast when you look at the seafloor in Monterey Canyon, it's mucky. That makes it tough for filter feeders, especially sponges. Any flat surface in the canyon collects mud. This makes it tough for corals to settle anywhere except on near-vertical surfaces. Just staying attached to these surfaces can be a challenge in itself.\"\n\nResearch also suggests that seamounts such as Davidson Seamount may be ecologically valuable to rare species that use them as breeding grounds. The seamounts are likely to be a source of larvae that maintains the population of the species in nearby, sub-optimal areas, known as \"sinks.\" Sinks are low-lying areas in which species can live, but do so very poorly; if they are not replenished by nearby population centers, such as at Davidson, they could disappear from the area entirely. DNA studies may in the future help scientists prove seamounts are indeed sources of larvae for their surrounding seafloor.\n\n ## History\n\n","h_score":1692842.9187500002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":13981318,"revid":1118800607,"description":"Underwater volcano near California","categories":["Landforms of California","Monterey Bay","Oceanography","Seamounts of the Pacific Ocean","Submarine volcanoes"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's the deal with Davidson Seamount\u2014 is it just another underwater bump?  \nA1: Picture a colossal, ancient volcano slumbering beneath the waves, rising like a forgotten giant off California's coast\u2014 that's Davidson Seamount in a nutshell.

The ground was also used as a cricket pitch during the summer by the East Suffolk Cricket Club who had played there since 1855. The cricket club had erected a pavilion, the first fixed building at the ground. More substantial elements of ground development did not begin for a further 11 years, though Ipswich became one of the first clubs to implement the use of goal nets in 1890. At this time, Ipswich were an amateur side (the team became professional in 1936) and the first visit of a professional club came in 1892, when Preston North End played a Suffolk County Football Association team. This was followed six years later by a visit from Aston Villa, a game which was so popular that a temporary stand was erected in order to accommodate a crowd of around 5,000. In 1901, a tobacco processing plant was built along the south edge of the ground by the Churchman brothers, a name which would later become synonymous with the south stand located there. The first permanent stand, a wooden structure known affectionately as the \"Chicken Run\", was built on the Portman Road side of the ground in 1906. This structure was sold in 1971 to the local speedway team, the Ipswich Witches, who installed it at Foxhall Stadium. In 1914, the ground was commandeered by the British Army for use as a training camp for the duration of the First World War. Control of Portman Road was not returned to the club until two years after the end of the war and significant work was required to repair damage to the ground caused by heavy machinery. For a short period during the 1920s, Portman Road was host to a number of whippet races in an attempt to increase revenue, and in 1928 a small stand was built on the west side of the ground. The football club turned professional in 1936 and the cricket club were forced to move out, so work began on the first bank of terracing at the north end of the pitch. The following year, on the back of winning the Southern League, a similar terrace was built at the southern \"Churchmans\" end and 650 tip-up seats, bought from Arsenal, were installed. Portman Road was home to Ipswich Town's first Football League match on 27 August 1938, a 4\u20132 victory against Southend United in Division Three (South) witnessed by more than 19,000 spectators. The Supporters' Association funded a number of improvements at Portman Road; in 1952, concrete terracing replaced the wooden terraces at the cost of \u00a33,000 and another \u00a33,000 was used to re-terrace the North Stand in 1954, bringing the capacity of the ground to approximately 29,000. In 1957, the association raised \u00a330,500 towards the building of a new West Stand, increasing ground capacity to around 31,000. Floodlights were installed two years later; the result of \u00a315,000 raised by the association.","h_score":1706384.4187500002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":1338681,"revid":1170521462,"description":"Stadium for Ipswich Town Football Club","categories":["1884 establishments in England","English Football League venues","Football venues in England","Football venues in Suffolk","Ipswich Town F.C.","Premier League venues","Sports venues completed in 1884","Sports venues in Ipswich"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"# Portman Road: The Historic Heart of Ipswich Football\n\nPortman Road serves as the iconic home stadium for Ipswich Town Football Club, a venue steeped in over a century of sporting drama and community pride.

Carved figures from the Roman de la Rose decorate the chimneypiece, which Crook considered \"one of the most glorious that Burges and Nicholls ever produced\". Echoing Crook, Charles Handley-Read wrote, \"Working together, Burges and Nicholls had transposed a poem into sculpture with a delicacy that is very nearly musical. The Roman de la Rose has come to life.\" The dining room is devoted to Geoffrey Chaucer's The House of Fame and the art of story-telling, Crook explaining that \"tall stories are part of the dining room rite\". The hooded chimneypiece, of Devonshire marble, contained a bronze figure above the fireplace representing the Goddess of Fame; its hands and face were made of ivory, with sapphires for eyes. It was later stolen. The tiles on the walls depict fairy stories, including Reynard the Fox, Jack and the Beanstalk and Little Red Riding Hood. The room also shows Burges's innovative use of materials: Handley-Read observed that the Victorians had \"a horror of food smells\" and therefore the room was constructed using materials that did not absorb odours and could be washed. The walls are covered with Devonshire marble, surmounted by glazed picture tiles, while the ceiling is of sheet metal. The ceiling is divided into coffered compartments by square beams and features symbols of the Sun, the planets and the signs of the Zodiac. Burges designed most of the cutlery and plates used in this room, which display his skills as a designer of metalwork, including the claret jug and Cat Cup chosen by Lord and Lady Bute as mementoes from Burges's collection after his death.

The interest in the film is attributed to a combination of the film's catchy soundtrack as well as its story of cross-generational connections between parents and children. The newfound interest led to waves of new merchandise based on the film to be sold at major retailers. On August 14, 2015, a 20th-anniversary reunion for the film was held at the D23 Expo at Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California. Those in attendance included Bill Farmer, Jason Marsden, Jim Cummings, Rob Paulsen, Jenna von O\u00ff and producer Don Hahn. Wallace Shawn, Pauly Shore and director Kevin Lima also sent video messages. The panel also included musical performances from Farmer, Marsden, and Tevin Campbell. While the panel was not expected to be one of the largest panels at D23, it ended up with the largest attended, with around 1,000 fans attending, and forcing the expo to turn away some due to lack of seating. In the video game Disney Magic Kingdoms, Pete, who appears as a character, makes some references to the film, wearing the same clothes and owning the same recreational vehicle with which he goes camping. In 2016, Campbell uploaded a video of him partaking in a jam session with the band Enfield, in which he performed both \"I 2 I\" and \"Stand Out\". In June 2018, a one-week event titled \"Disney FanDaze\" was opened in Disneyland Paris, featuring several dedicated performances paying tribute to Disney franchises. Among these was \"Max Live! Gettin' Goofy With It\", which featured Max Goof performing songs from A Goofy Movie. In April 2019, singer Uch\u00e9 performed \"I 2 I\" during the Top 10 Disney Night of American Idol's seventeenth season. According to co-producer Frank Angones, the film was a strong influence during early development of the 2017 DuckTales series, particularly on its version of Donald Duck, as the creators \"wanted [the] show to do for Donald what Goofy Movie did for Goofy\". The series itself featured several references to the film, including the appearances of the song \"Stand Out\", Lester's Possum Park, and pictures of Goofy, Max, and Roxanne. In October 2021, Cody Rigsby and Cheryl Burke danced a Jive to \"Stand Out\" during night one of Disney Week on the 30th season of Dancing with the Stars.

However, Henry the Young King challenged the election, on the grounds of illegitimacy and an uncanonical election. Reginald went to Rome in the company of Richard of Dover, who had just been elected Archbishop of Canterbury and was facing a challenge from the Young King to his election. Reginald was confirmed by Pope Alexander III on 18 April 1174 with Walter Map alleging bribery as the only reason the election was confirmed. Ralph de Diceto, however, states that Reginald swore an oath that he was uninvolved in the death of Becket and that his birth took place before his father became a priest. During the dispute, Reginald's friend Peter of Blois wrote him a letter, which is still extant, encouraging him to persevere.\n\nAs a bishop, Reginald was kept busy attending the king's councils and the royal court, but also took part in the 1178 mission to Toulouse, led by Cardinal Pierre of San Crisogono, which attempted to deal with the Cathar heretics there. He attended the Third Lateran Council in 1179. During the 1180s, he was more active in the affairs of his diocese, and appears less often in the secular affairs of the kingdom, but in 1189 he took part in the coronation of King Richard I of England. In April 1191 he was one of the persons selected to arbitrate between the chancellor William Longchamp and Prince John of England. He also attended the trial of William Longchamp on 5 October 1191 at Loddon Bridge between Reading and Windsor that dismissed Longchamp from his offices. He may have been an unsuccessful candidate for the chancellorship of England. He was active as a bishop: some 122 acta from his time as bishop survive.

His career highlighted the tensions between royal and ecclesiastical power during the reigns of Henry II and Richard I.\n\n#### Early Life and Rise\nBorn around 1145, Reginald Fitz Jocelin came from a noble family and entered the church at a young age, quickly rising through the ranks due to his administrative skills. He studied in Paris and became a royal clerk, which positioned him for influential roles, including his appointment as Bishop of Chichester in 1173 and later to Bath in 1174. \"Fitz Jocelin's early career demonstrated the importance of education and connections in medieval advancement,\" noted historian Frank Barlow in his biography.\n\n#### Major Contributions and Conflicts\nFitz Jocelin was involved in significant events, such as the aftermath of Thomas Becket's murder, where he mediated between the Crown and the Church. He participated in diplomatic missions and councils, helping shape canon law and church reforms. During his tenure, he faced challenges like disputes over clerical privileges, as recorded in contemporary chronicles. \"His role in the 1180s councils was crucial for maintaining church stability,\" stated chronicler Gerald of Wales in his writings.\n\n#### Historical Impact\nFitz Jocelin's efforts influenced the structure of the English church, particularly in administration and relations with the monarchy. He died in 1198 before his election as Archbishop of Canterbury could be finalized, leaving a legacy in ecclesiastical governance. His life exemplifies the interplay between religion and politics in the Middle Ages.\n\nToday, historians examine Fitz Jocelin's era to understand ongoing themes in church-state dynamics."}

He made his maiden speech on 8 May 1992. In Parliament he joined the Foreign Affairs Select Committee in 1992 and, after the 1997 general election, he was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office Paul Murphy; he also worked for the other Minister of State Adam Ingram until 1999 when he joined the Defence Select Committee. Following the 2001 general election, he was again appointed a PPS to the Minister of State at the Home Office Jeff Rooker for a year. He rejoined the Defence Select Committee in 2003. Following the 2005 general election he served as the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee until 2010. Gapes was an officer of many All-party Parliamentary Groups (APPG), including Chair of the All-Party Crossrail Group, Chair of the All-Party Global Security and non Proliferation Group and Chair of the All-Party United Nations Group. He was part of the Northern Ireland team which negotiated the Good Friday Agreement in Belfast in 1998. During the 2001 and 2005 general election campaigns, he was the target of Muslim groups, including (according to the Ilford Recorder) the Association of Ilford Muslims, and Islamic Society of Britain (Ilford Branch), as well as (according to The Jewish Chronicle) the Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK, who he says sought to unseat him because of his pro-Israel views. Gapes is a member of Labour Friends of Israel (LFI). In 2007, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee reported that it was \"unlikely\" any abuse was continuing at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp since 2004, calling the facilities \"broadly comparable\" to HM Prison Belmarsh. Gapes said: \"I thought that we would see detainees in orange overalls kept in cages, but they are now in modern blocks. The images from 2002 were of Camp X-Ray and that is now shut\", adding that an immediate shutdown of Guantanamo Bay would lead to a release of individuals back into society who were \"dangerous\". Andrew Tyrie, chair of the all-party group on extraordinary rendition said the report was a \"deep disappointment\" and did not acknowledge the moral responsibility to British residents in Guantanamo; Clive Stafford Smith, who represented prisoners at the base, said the report was \"full of factual errors\" and based on a \"show tour\" and Kate Allen, director of Amnesty International, called the report \"a missed opportunity\". Also in 2007, Gapes was criticised for claiming \u00a322,110 for a second home despite his constituency being only 39 minutes away from Westminster. Gapes responded to the criticism saying \"It's perfectly allowed\". In 2008, as chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Gapes met with the Dalai Lama and asked his opinion on human rights in Tibet. As head of the committee, he was heavily critical of the nuclear program of Iran, arguing that there was a \"strong possibility\" Iran would develop a nuclear bomb by 2015. Gapes was Chair of the committee until 2010 and continued to be a member of the committee until 2019.","h_score":1726693.3375000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":426646,"revid":1163234627,"description":"British politician (born 1952)","categories":["1952 births","Alumni of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge","Alumni of Middlesex University","British political party founders","Change UK MPs","Labour Co-operative MPs for English constituencies","Labour Friends of Israel","Living people","People educated at Buckhurst Hill County High School","People from Loughton","People from Wanstead","Politics of the London Borough of Redbridge","UK MPs 1992\u20131997","UK MPs 1997\u20132001","UK MPs 2001\u20132005","UK MPs 2005\u20132010","UK MPs 2010\u20132015","UK MPs 2017\u20132019"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Mike Gapes?  \nA1: Mike Gapes is a British politician who served as a Member of Parliament for Ilford South from 1992 to 2019.

Thurstan managed to secure the resurrection of the Diocese of Galloway, or Whithorn, in 1125. It is possible that he compromised with Fergus of Galloway, who was the lord or sub-king of Galloway, in what is now Scotland. In this Thurstan secured another suffragan, and Fergus gained a bishop in his lordship, where previously ecclesiastical matters in his subkingdom had been handled by Scottish bishops. The first bishop was the native Galwegian \u2013 Gilla Aldan. This provoked the wrath of Wimund, Bishop of the Isles, who had previously had jurisdiction over Galloway; but the new bishopric survived, and York had a new suffragan, an important step in the battle between York and Canterbury over the primacy, which was mainly a battle over the prestige of their respective sees. The number of bishops subject to either archbishop was an important factor in the reputation of each. In 1133, Thurstan, who had received papal permission to found an entirely new diocese, consecrated \u00c6thelwold as the first bishop of the new see of Carlisle.\n\nThurstan refused to accept that the new Archbishop of Canterbury, William de Corbeil, was his superior, and did not help with William's consecration. The dispute between the two continued, and both archbishops carried their complaints in person to Rome twice. In 1126, Pope Honorius II ruled in favour of York. The pope based his decision on the fact that Canterbury's supporting documents had been forged.\n\nThurstan supported King Stephen after Henry I's death in 1135, and appeared at Stephen's first court at Easter held at Westminster. Thurstan negotiated a truce at Roxburgh in 1138 between England and Scotland. It was Thurstan who mustered the army which defeated the Scots at the Battle of the Standard on 22 August 1138 near Northallerton, Yorkshire. Thurstan did not take direct part in the battle., but he created the standard that gave the battle its name, by putting a ship's mast in a cart and hanging the banners of Saint Peter of York, Saint John of Beverley, and Saint Wilfrid of Ripon on the mast. The Scots had invaded attempting to aid the Empress Matilda, the daughter of Henry I and Stephen's rival for the throne. On 21 January 1140 Thurstan resigned his see and entered the order of the Cluniacs at Pontefract and he died there on 6 February 1140. He was buried in the church at Pontefract.\n\n","h_score":1747839.2250000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":157987,"revid":1137975507,"description":"12th-century Anglo-Norman Archbishop of York","categories":["1070s births","1140 deaths","12th-century English Roman Catholic archbishops","Anglo-Normans","Archbishops of York","Cluniacs","Henry I of England","People of The Anarchy","William II of England","Year of birth uncertain"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Thurstan?  \nA1: Thurstan was a notable historical figure, serving as Archbishop of York in 12th-century England from 1114 to 1140. Born around 1070, he rose through the ranks of the Church amid the Norman Conquest's aftermath. His story weaves through medieval politics like a steadfast thread in a turbulent tapestry.\n\nQ2: What was Thurstan's early background?  \nA2: Little is known of Thurstan's early life, but he likely hailed from a Norman family, possibly in France, before arriving in England. He entered the clergy young, gaining education and influence in a world of stone cathedrals and royal courts. This foundation shaped his later role as a bridge between Norman rulers and English traditions.\n\nQ3: What key positions did Thurstan hold?  \nA3: Thurstan primarily served as Archbishop of York, overseeing one of England's most powerful dioceses. He also acted as a royal advisor, navigating alliances with kings like Henry I. His tenure sparkled with diplomatic maneuvers, balancing church authority against the crown's grip.\n\nQ4: What were Thurstan's major achievements?  \nA4: Thurstan championed church reforms, strengthening clerical independence from secular powers. He played a pivotal role in the Battle of the Standard in 1138, rallying northern forces against Scottish invaders. His efforts painted him as a defender of English interests in an era of clashing loyalties.\n\nQ5: How did Thurstan interact with royalty?  \nA5: Thurstan often clashed with King Henry I over church rights, yet he remained a loyal counselor during crises. He supported Henry's daughter, Empress Matilda, in succession disputes, adding layers to his political dance. Like a skilled navigator, he steered through royal storms without capsizing his influence.\n\nQ6: What challenges did Thurstan face?  \nA6: Thurstan grappled with internal church rivalries and external threats from invading armies. He endured exiles and disputes with the Pope, testing his resolve like waves against ancient cliffs. These trials highlighted his resilience in a fractured medieval landscape.\n\nQ7: What was Thurstan's lasting impact?  \nA7: Thurstan's reforms bolstered the English Church's autonomy, influencing its structure for centuries. His military leadership in northern defenses helped shape England's borders. Today, he stands as a vivid emblem of faith and strategy in historical narratives.\n\nQ8: How is Thurstan remembered today?  \nA8: Modern historians view Thurstan as a pragmatic leader who blended piety with politics, often featured in books on medieval England. His legacy inspires discussions on church-state relations, much like a faint echo in today's debates. Though not a household name, his story adds rich texture to the tapestry of British history."}

The supreme god of Lingbao Daoists is known as the Yuanshi Tianzun or the Celestial Worthy of the Original Beginning, who played a similar role to the deified Laozi in the Celestial Masters. According to the scriptures, this god went through a series of kalpa cycles that were given names similar to dynastic names, until emerging at the beginning of the Kaihuang period. The next most important god was Laojun, the deified form of Laozi, who was the Celestial Worthy's chief disciple. Below these two main gods in the celestial hierarchy were those deities associated with the Southern Palace, where spirits went after death to prepare for rebirth. The head of this group of gods was known as the Perfected of the Southern Extremities. Beneath him was the Director of the Equerry, who was in charge of the life records of the spirits, and Lord Han, who controlled Fengdu, the city of the dead. Below these principal gods in the Lingbao hierarchy were other deities such as the Five Old Men, the Dragon Kings, and the Demon Kings.\n\nDeities were present not only in the heavens, but also in the human body itself. They were responsible for maintaining the body's five viscera, guarding the registers of life, and regulating the souls. There were five internal deities that were particularly important in Lingbao Daoism. The Great Unity lived in the head, along with Lordling and White Prime, who could descend into the liver and lungs. The Director of Destinies lived in the heart and sexual organs, and finally, the Peach Child lived in the lower dantian. Normally these deities resided in the heavens, but they could be activated by scriptural recitations to descend into the body.\n\n ## Practices\n\n ### Immortality techniques\n\nDespite a belief in reincarnation, the Lingbao School maintained the traditional Daoist idea that certain techniques could allow an adherent to achieve immortality. One technique was to ingest the essence of the sun and the moon. Practitioners would expose themselves to the celestial bodies at certain times of the month. Closing their eyes, they would visualize that the essences would solidify and enter their bodies. Once in the body, the sun's essence was matched to the heart and visualized as red, while the moon's was matched with the kidneys and seen as black. Besides interior meditation practices, immortality could be achieved through the ingestion of potions or talismans.\n\n ### Rituals\n\nEarly Lingbao ritual was mostly done on an individual basis, either in a meditation chamber, or the courtyard of a house. Early practitioners were not professional priests, but rather 'students of the Dao'. Later on, as the Lingbao movement developed religious institutions and an established clergy, ritual practice became more of a communal rite.\n\nLingbao ritual shares a great deal with ritual in other Daoist traditions. Like other traditions, Lingbao rituals had a theatrical quality that involved accompanying music, dances, and chants. Lingbao Daoism also shared the multidimensional aspect of Daoist ritual, meaning that it was carried on at several different levels simultaneously. For example, while a ritual was being performed, the priest would repeat the ritual within himself through interior meditation.\n\nThere are three categories of ritual in Lingbao Daoism. The first is known as the heavenly Golden Register of Rituals, and is carried out to prevent natural disasters. During the Tang dynasty, this ritual was carried out in honour of the imperial family, but later it could be performed by anyone. The earthly Yellow Register ritual was performed to ensure the dead was at rest. The final type of ritual, which has not survived, was the human Jade Register, which was performed to ensure the salvation of mankind. Of the rituals that have survived, the Golden Register has assumed the role of the Jade register, ensuring salvation and preventing bad weather.\n\n","h_score":1727544.28125,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":2530681,"revid":1141404415,"description":"Daoist school","categories":["Taoist schools"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Lingbao School: A Rural Gem in Chinese Education\n\nIn the heart of Henan Province, China, Lingbao School stands out as a beacon of innovative learning, transforming rural education through creative curricula and community engagement.

Lady Gaga, drawing from her own experiences, co-wrote the track with Diane Warren to soundtrack \"The Hunting Ground,\" a film exposing institutional failures in addressing assault. Like a storm brewing on the horizon, the song's creation turned personal scars into a public thunderclap, urging listeners to face the epidemic head-on.\n\n### Lyrics That Sting Like Shrapnel\nThe lyrics weave a tapestry of vulnerability and defiance, with lines that hit like unexpected punches to the gut, forcing empathy where none existed. \"You tell me it gets better, it gets better in time,\" Lady Gaga once shared in an interview, highlighting the song's raw portrayal of healing's slow burn. Yet, it's the track's refrain that echoes like a persistent heartbeat, reminding us that indifference crumbles under the weight of shared stories, as noted by survivor advocate Chanel Miller, who said, \"Words like these shatter the silence that survivors endure.\"\n\n### Ripples in the Cultural Tide\nBeyond its initial release, the song has rippled through activism, inspiring movements and policy pushes for campus safety reforms. It transforms passive listeners into active allies, using music's magnetic pull to dismantle taboos with the force of a tidal wave. As debates on consent and accountability surge forward, \"Til It Happens to You\" stands as a beacon, promising that one day, its message might render such anthems obsolete."}

Archaeoindris was one of the largest primates to ever evolve, and was the largest-known strepsirrhine primate, weighing an estimated 160 kg (350 lb). It was roughly the size of an adult male gorilla, which was first noted by Lamberton. Since its discovery, size estimates have varied from \"larger than a human\" to \"possibly the largest primate ever\". In a study by Jungers from 1990, the area of its molar teeth predicted a mass of 230.5 kg (508 lb), while the femoral head diameter predicted a mass of 244.1 kg (538 lb). In 1995, Laurie Godfrey estimated a mass of 197.5 kg (435 lb) using the midshaft circumferences of the humerus and femur. Based on multiple regressions of the cortical area of the femur in 2008, Jungers and colleagues generated the current best estimate of 161.2 kg (355 lb) with a possible range of 150\u2013187.8 kg (331\u2013414 lb). These estimates were considered to be more accurate since the harder cortical bone in the midshaft of the femur supported an animal's weight, and its thickness better correlated with the animal's mass than the midshaft diameter (which includes both hard cortex and spongy bone). The only fossil primate that was probably larger than Archaeoindris was Gigantopithecus blacki, a close relative of orangutans. Like all three species of Palaeopropithecus, Archaeoindris exhibited derived traits not seen in the two other less specialized genera of sloth lemur. These traits included deflated auditory bullae and paired protrusions of bone around the nasal opening consisting of part of the premaxilla and the nasal bones. Its skull was wider than that of Megaladapis, but shorter, measuring 269 millimeters (10.6 inches). Its face was shorter than that of Palaeopropithecus, with its eyes directed further forward. The neurocranium (braincase) was small and elevated relative to the face, unlike Palaeopropithecus. Postorbital constriction (narrowing of the skull behind the eye sockets) is pronounced. The skull also bore a low, broad sagittal crest (a ridge of bone on the top of the skull to which jaw muscles attach) and robust but smaller nuchal crests (ridges of bone on the back of the skull to which neck muscles attach). Unlike Palaeopropithecus the rims of the orbits (eye sockets) were not as thick. The area of the orbit was 946 mm<sup>2<\/sup> (1.466 sq in), comparable to that of gorillas. Based on the ratio of its orbit area to the size of its optic canal, Archaeoindris had low retinal summation, meaning its eyes were less sensitive to light (like living diurnal lemurs).","h_score":1694946.2250000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":2456129,"revid":1139746022,"description":"Extinct giant lemur","categories":["Endemic fauna of Madagascar","Extinct animals of Madagascar","Fossil taxa described in 1909","Holocene extinctions","Lemur genera","Prehistoric animals of Madagascar","Prehistoric monotypic mammal genera","Prehistoric primate genera","Quaternary mammals of Africa","Subfossil lemurs"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's Archaeoindris, you ask\u2014some ancient beast from the shadows?  \nA1: Archaeoindris was a colossal lemur, the heavyweight champion of Madagascar's extinct primates, roaming the island like a furry giant some 2 million years ago. Picture it as a sloth-like creature with a lemur's curious eyes, weighing up to 200 kilograms and dwarfing its modern cousins. This prehistoric oddity offers a glimpse into a wilder world of evolution's experiments.\n\nQ2: Where and when did this leafy leviathan call home?  \nA2: It strutted through the lush, misty forests of Madagascar during the Pleistocene epoch, from about 2 million to 26,000 years ago. Imagine ancient rainforests teeming with bizarre life, where Archaeoindris swung from branches like a misplaced monster in a tropical fairy tale. Its habitat hints at a lost Eden now reshaped by time and humans.\n\nQ3: How big was this beast\u2014did it tower like a tree?  \nA3: Standing over a meter tall, Archaeoindris was the largest lemur ever, with a body built for slow, powerful climbs rather than speedy dashes. Think of it as a gentle giant, akin to a bear-sized koala, using its massive frame to dominate the canopy. Its size made it a living legend in the primate world.\n\nQ4: What did it munch on in its leafy lair?  \nA4: As a folivore, Archaeoindris feasted mainly on leaves, fruits, and perhaps the occasional bark, grinding them with strong jaws in a slow, methodical ritual. Envision it as a verdant vacuum, hoovering up the forest's bounty to fuel its enormous bulk. This diet painted it as a key player in Madagascar's ancient ecosystem.\n\nQ5: How did this shadowy specter behave in the wild?  \nA5: Likely a solitary browser, Archaeoindris spent its days lounging and foraging high in the trees, moving with deliberate grace like a prehistoric lounge lizard. Its behavior suggests a laid-back lifestyle, avoiding predators through sheer size rather than speed. This paints a vivid picture of a creature perfectly adapted to its isolated realm.\n\nQ6: Why did this mighty lemur vanish into the void?  \nA6: Human arrival around 2,000 years ago, coupled with habitat loss and hunting, likely sealed Archaeoindris's fate in a tragic twist of fate. Imagine the forests shrinking like a deflated balloon, leaving no room for such a specialized giant. Its extinction underscores the fragility of oversized wonders in a changing world.\n\nQ7: How does Archaeoindris stack up against today's lemurs?  \nA7: Unlike the nimble, smaller lemurs we see today, Archaeoindris was a brute force of nature, evolving in isolation to become a true evolutionary outlier. Picture modern lemurs as spry acrobats compared to this lumbering behemoth, highlighting how environments shape survival strategies. This contrast reveals the diverse paths of Madagascar's primate family tree.\n\nQ8: What echoes does Archaeoindris leave for us today?  \nA8: As a fossilized reminder of biodiversity's losses, Archaeoindris urges modern conservation efforts to protect fragile ecosystems like Madagascar's. Envision it as a ghostly mentor, teaching us about climate change's impacts and the risks of human interference. Its story adds a nuanced layer to evolutionary studies, inspiring us to safeguard what's left of such wonders."}

The Hasanids, led by the brothers Muhammad (called \"the Pure Soul\") and Ibrahim, rejected the legitimacy of the Abbasid family's claim to power. Reacting to mounting persecution by the Abbasid regime, in 762 they launched a rebellion, with Muhammad rising in revolt at Medina in September and Ibrahim following in Basra in November.\n\nThe Hasanid's lack of co-ordination and organization, as well as the lukewarm support of their followers, allowed the Abbasids under Caliph al-Mansur to react swiftly. The Caliph contained Muhammad's rebellion in the Hejaz and crushed it only two weeks after Ibrahim's uprising, before turning his forces against the latter. Ibrahim's rebellion had achieved some initial successes in southern Iraq, but his camp was torn by dissent among rival Shi'a groups as to the prosecution of the war and future political objectives. In the end, Ibrahim's army was decisively defeated at Bakhamra in January 763, with Ibrahim dying of his wounds shortly after.\n\nThe failure of the rebellion did not mark the end of Alid unrest, but it consolidated the power of the Abbasid dynasty.\n\n","h_score":1718797.4875,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":36889983,"revid":1173494283,"description":"Revolt in the Abbasid Caliphate","categories":["760s conflicts","762","763","8th century in the Abbasid Caliphate","8th-century rebellions","Battles involving the Alids","Iraq under the Abbasid Caliphate","Medina under the Abbasid Caliphate","Rebellions against the Abbasid Caliphate"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Alid Revolt: A Fiery Challenge to Abbasid Power in 762\u2013763\n\nIn the late 8th century, descendants of the Prophet Muhammad's son-in-law Ali rose against the newly established Abbasid Caliphate, seeking to claim the throne they believed was rightfully theirs. This rebellion, led by Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya and his brother Ibrahim, highlighted deep sectarian tensions and ultimately ended in defeat, reshaping the political landscape of the Islamic world.\n\n#### The Roots of Rebellion\nThe Alid revolt stemmed from lingering grievances after the Abbasids overthrew the Umayyads in 750, as many Shiites felt betrayed by the new rulers who promised reform but favored their own lineage. In Medina and other key cities, supporters of Ali's descendants viewed the Abbasids as usurpers, fueling underground networks that whispered of divine destiny and holy war. This period was marked by economic hardships and religious fervor, turning quiet discontent into a brewing storm of resistance.\n\n#### The Uprising and Clashes\nBy 762, Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya boldly declared himself caliph in Medina, rallying followers with promises of justice and piety. \"I am the Mahdi, sent by God to restore true leadership,\" he proclaimed, as quoted in historical accounts by the chronicler al-Tabari. The revolt spread to Basra under Ibrahim, but Abbasid forces, led by Caliph al-Mansur, swiftly mobilized, crushing the uprising in brutal battles that left thousands dead by 763. \"We will uproot this treason and secure our empire,\" al-Mansur declared, underscoring the regime's unyielding resolve.\n\n#### Legacy and Impact\nThe failure of the revolt solidified Abbasid control, prompting harsher crackdowns on dissent and the fortification of Baghdad as the imperial center. It deepened the divide between Sunni and Shia Muslims, inspiring future uprisings that echoed the Alids' call for legitimacy. As the dust settled, the event served as a stark reminder of how religious claims could ignite widespread turmoil.\n\nLooking ahead, the Alid revolt's echoes continue to influence modern discussions on Islamic governance and sectarian relations, underscoring the enduring quest for rightful authority."}

Each was staffed to cater for 200 officers and 2,000 other ranks. The first of these arrived on 7 June, and was employed as a collection and transit centre. The next arrived on 11 June, and established a POW camp near Arromanches. Camps had been established in the UK for up to 25,000 prisoners but only 12,153 were captured by 26 July. Most were German but there were also Russians, Poles and other nationalities. Most were taken to the UK, but some were retained for labour duties. POW escorts were provided by the War Office and were based at Southampton. They crossed to Normandy on LSTs, collected the prisoners and took them back to the UK. This procedure did not work as well as planned, because the prisoners were not always ready to move when required, and the LSTs were unable to wait for them.\n\nThe first CMP units to arrive landed on D-Day. These were three divisional provost companies, six beach provost companies, and two corps provost companies, which were used for traffic control. During the build-up phase, an additional company arrived with each division; four provost companies, four traffic control (TC) companies, and a vulnerable points (VP) company for each army and seven provost, seven TC and three VP companies for the Line of Communications Area. The VP companies were used to guard POWs. Delays in getting provost units ashore allowed traffic congestion to occur on the first two days, but the Line of Communications Area was established faster than planned when traffic congestion became a problem. One check point saw 18,836 vehicles pass it in a day, roughly one every four seconds. Despite all efforts, key towns like Courseulles and Bayeux soon became bottlenecks. Bypasses were built, and strict movement control was instituted. Under this regime, operational vehicles operated at night when the volume of administrative traffic was lighter.

The French Revolution a year earlier had torn the Whig party in half, with Coke and Fox in the isolated minority who supported the revolutionaries as their acts became more brutal. With the declaration of war in 1793, an impact was finally felt in Britain with a rise in agricultural prices and rent. It also led to the establishment of local yeomanry forces to defend the country, something Coke opposed. This reduced his popularity in Norfolk and led to suspicions he might be a Jacobin, to the point where he was forced to publicly declare that he was not a Republican and \"detested their principles\". Eventually, in late September 1798, he raised the Holkham Yeoman Cavalry, commanding it as a Major, to defend against any invasion. This unit was dissolved in 1802 with the Peace of Amiens, but after war broke out again a year later more volunteer regiments were formed. Coke was notably absent from any preparations for defence, feeling that the risks of invasion were exaggerated, but was eventually persuaded by public opinion to reform the Yeoman Cavalry in 1803; it was again dissolved in 1805. The French Revolution had split the Whigs into two factions, but as it progressed Fox's group in support of the revolutionaries began to dwindle. Coke stuck by Fox, and with the outbreak of the War, the split became finalised; Fox refused to accept that Britain need be involved in the conflict, as did Coke. In Parliament, Coke spoke out against the conflict, debating the motion to raise money for the war through a new tax in April 1794, and supporting Wilberforce's anti-war motion on 24 March 1795. He felt more comfortable with local matters, however, and his main concerns \"were those of the agricultural interest\", arguing against a new land tax and introducing a bill to shorten the shooting season, allowing for the production of more corn. Coke was again returned to Parliament in 1796, despite an anti-war and anti-government address to the electorate which was condemned as arrogant and dictatorial, but found on his return that the Foxites had agreed to withdraw from Parliamentary activity. After Parliament was dissolved in June 1802, another election saw Coke again returned, although in a contested election that cost the candidates \u00a335,000. With the death of William Pitt in 1806, the two Whig groups agreed to an alliance, which took the form of the Ministry of All the Talents; Fox was confirmed as Foreign Secretary, and Windham as Secretary for War and the Colonies. The government apparently offered Coke a peerage, which he refused, and primarily focused on the abolition of slavery, which was accomplished only after the death of Fox on 13 September 1806. Fox's death made Parliament lose some of its appeal to Coke, as they had been close friends. His attendance in the next two years was very limited, and the next occasion of note was his support of the Corn Laws, which were highly unpopular in Norfolk and led to him being physically attacked by a mob in 1815.","h_score":1703117.0,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":1009538,"revid":1161029116,"description":"British politician (1754\u20131842)","categories":["1754 births","1842 deaths","18th-century English farmers","19th-century English farmers","British MPs 1774\u20131780","British MPs 1780\u20131784","British MPs 1790\u20131796","British MPs 1796\u20131800","British landlords","British reformers","Coke family","Earls of Leicester (1837 creation)","English agriculturalists","Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for Norfolk","Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Derby","Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Norfolk","Peers of the United Kingdom created by Queen Victoria","People educated at Eton College","People from Holkham","People from Longford, Derbyshire","UK MPs 1801\u20131802","UK MPs 1802\u20131806","UK MPs 1806\u20131807","UK MPs 1807\u20131812","UK MPs 1812\u20131818","UK MPs 1818\u20131820","UK MPs 1820\u20131826","UK MPs 1826\u20131830","UK MPs 1830\u20131831","UK MPs 1831\u20131832","UK MPs who were granted peerages"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (seventh creation)?  \nA1: Thomas Coke was an 18th-century British nobleman and agricultural pioneer, born into wealth and influence.

Prior to the nineteenth century, the term would have simply meant country song, with no particular form implied \u2014 a meaning it retains in the vocabulary of early music. According to Julie Kane, the refrain in each stanza indicates that the form descended from a \"choral dance song\" wherein a vocal soloist \u2014 frequently female \u2014 semi-improvised the \"unique\" lyrics of each stanza, while a ring of dancers\u2014all female, or male and female mixed\u2014chimed in with the repetitive words of the refrain as they danced around her in a circle.\" The fixed-form villanelle, containing the nineteen-line dual-refrain, derives from Jean Passerat's poem \"Villanelle (J'ay perdu ma Tourterelle)\", published in 1606. The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics (1993) suggests that this became the standard \"villanelle\" when prosodists such as C\u00e9sar-Pierre Richelet based their definitions of the form on that poem. This conclusion is refuted by Kane, however, who argues that it was instead Pierre-Charles Berthelin's additions to Richelet's Dictionnaire de rimes that first fixed the form, followed a century later by the poet Th\u00e9odore de Banville; his creation of a parody to Passerat's \"J'ay perdu ...\" would lead Wilhelm T\u00e9nint and others to think that the villanelle was an antique form. Despite its classification and origin as a French poetic form, by far the majority of villanelles have been written in English. Subsequent to the publication of Th\u00e9odore de Banville's treatise on prosody \"Petit trait\u00e9 de po\u00e9sie fran\u00e7aise\" (1872), the form became popularised in England through Edmund Gosse and Austin Dobson. Gosse, Dobson, Oscar Wilde, Andrew Lang, and John Payne were among the first English practitioners\u2014theirs and other works were published in Gleeson White's Ballades and Rondeaus, Chants Royal, Sestinas, Villanelles, &c. Selected (1887), which contained 32 English-language villanelles composed by 19 poets. Most modernists disdained the villanelle, which became associated with the overwrought formal aestheticism of the 1890s, i.e., the decadent movement in England. In his 1914 novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, James Joyce includes a villanelle written by his protagonist Stephen Dedalus. William Empson revived the villanelle more seriously in the 1930s, and his contemporaries and friends W. H. Auden and Dylan Thomas also picked up the form. Dylan Thomas's \"Do not go gentle into that good night\" is perhaps the most renowned villanelle of all. Theodore Roethke and Sylvia Plath wrote villanelles in the 1950s and 1960s, and Elizabeth Bishop wrote a particularly famous and influential villanelle, \"One Art,\" in 1976. The villanelle reached an unprecedented level of popularity in the 1980s and 1990s with the rise of the New Formalism. Since then, many contemporary poets have written villanelles, and they have often varied the form in innovative ways; in their anthology of villanelles (Villanelles), Annie Finch and Marie-Elizabeth Mali devote a section entitled \"Variations on the Villanelle\" to such innovations. ## Form\n\nThe villanelle consists of five stanzas of three lines (tercets) followed by a single stanza of four lines (a quatrain) for a total of nineteen lines. It is structured by two repeating rhymes and two refrains: the first line of the first stanza serves as the last line of the second and fourth stanzas, and the third line of the first stanza serves as the last line of the third and fifth stanzas. The rhyme-and-refrain pattern of the villanelle can be schematized as A<sup>1<\/sup>bA<sup>2<\/sup> abA<sup>1<\/sup> abA<sup>2<\/sup> abA<sup>1<\/sup> abA<sup>2<\/sup> abA<sup>1<\/sup>A<sup>2<\/sup>. Here, \"a\" and \"A\" lines rhyme, and A<sup>1<\/sup> and A<sup>2<\/sup> indicate two different refrains which are repeated exactly.\n\nThe villanelle has no established meter, although most 19th-century villanelles used trimeter or tetrameter and most 20th-century villanelles used pentameter. Slight alteration of the refrain line is permissible.\n\n","h_score":1744619.8500000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":32683,"revid":1170047527,"description":"Fixed verse form; nineteen-line poetic form consisting of five tercets followed by a quatrain","categories":["French poetry","Poetic forms","Rhyme","Stanzaic form"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's a villanelle, anyway\u2014poetry's secret handshake?  \nA1: A villanelle is a poetic form that spins words into a mesmerizing loop, consisting of 19 lines with five tercets and a final quatrain. It demands a rhyme scheme of ABA, where the first and third lines repeat alternately, creating an echo that pulls readers into its rhythmic whirl. This structure turns simple verses into a playful game of repetition and surprise.\n\nQ2: Where did this quirky form originate?  \nA2: The villanelle traces back to 16th-century France, evolving from Italian pastoral poetry into a refined structure popularized in English by poets like Dylan Thomas. It's like a literary heirloom, passed down with twists, blending elegance and constraint to evoke deep emotions. Over time, it migrated across languages, adapting while keeping its core repetitive charm.\n\nQ3: How does the structure work\u2014think of it as a poetic puzzle?  \nA3: It features 19 lines: five stanzas of three lines each, followed by a four-line finale, all woven with an ABA rhyme scheme. The first line repeats as the third in the second and fourth stanzas, and the third line echoes as the third in the third and fifth, building tension like a coiled spring. This design forces poets to dance with limitations, turning repetition into a vivid, unfolding story.\n\nQ4: Can you name some famous villanelles that pack a punch?  \nA4: Dylan Thomas's \"Do not go gentle into that good night\" is a fiery classic, raging against death with its looping lines. Elizabeth Bishop's \"One Art\" masterfully masks grief under everyday losses, using the form's echoes to heighten irony. These examples show how villanelles transform personal turmoil into universal, image-rich tapestries.\n\nQ5: Why all the repetition\u2014is it just poetic stubbornness?  \nA5: Repetition in a villanelle acts like a insistent heartbeat, emphasizing themes and building emotional intensity with each return. It challenges writers to refine ideas, creating layers of meaning that surprise and deepen, much like a song's chorus that sticks in your mind. This playful constraint keeps the poem taut, turning echoes into unexpected revelations.\n\nQ6: Any tips for crafting your own villanelle\u2014without losing your mind?  \nA6: Start with strong opening lines that can bear repeating, then build stanzas around the ABA rhyme while weaving in those echoes naturally. Treat it as a verbal labyrinth, experimenting with rhythm to avoid monotony and let imagery flow vividly. Remember, the fun lies in the constraints, turning frustration into a triumphant, polished piece.\n\nQ7: How does a villanelle differ from other poem forms, like a sonnet?  \nQ7: How does a villanelle differ from other poem forms, like a sonnet?  \nA7: Unlike a sonnet's compact 14 lines and volta twist, a villanelle's 19 lines emphasize relentless repetition, making it more obsessive and expansive. This creates a hypnotic build-up versus a sonnet's neat resolution, offering poets a canvas for vivid, looping narratives rather than concise arguments. It's the difference between a quick sketch and a sprawling mural of words.\n\nQ8: What's the lasting impact of villanelles in modern poetry?  \nA8: Villanelles influence contemporary poets by blending tradition with innovation, inspiring explorations of memory, loss, and obsession in works by writers like Sylvia Plath. Their structured repetition provides a rebellious framework for vivid imagery and unexpected angles, keeping poetry fresh and engaging. Ultimately, they remind us that constraints can spark creative fireworks, echoing into today's verse."}

The walled city of Shibam in Yemen, designated a World Heritage Site in 1982, is known for its ten-story unreinforced mud-brick buildings. The Djinguereber Mosque of Timbuktu, Mali, was first built at the start of the 14th century AD (8th century AH) from round mud bricks and a stone-mud mixture, and was rebuilt several times afterwards, steadily growing in size. Further south in Mali, the Great Mosque of Djenn\u00e9, a dramatic example of Sahel mudbrick architecture. was built in 1907, based on the design of an earlier Great Mosque first built on the site in 1280. Mudbrick requires maintenance, and the fundamentalist ruler Seku Amadu had let the previous mosque collapse.\n\nThe Casa Grande Ruins, now a national monument in Arizona protected by a modern roof, is a massive four-story adobe structure built by Hohokam people between 1200 and 1450 AD. The first European to record the great house was a Jesuit priest, Father Eusebio Kino, who visited the site in 1694. At that time it had long been abandoned. By the time a temporary roof was installed in 1903 the adobe building had been standing empty and unmaintained for hundreds of years.\n\nHuaca de la Luna in what is now northern Peru is a large adobe temple built by the Moche people. The building went through a series of construction phases, growing eventually to a height of about 32 metres (105 ft), with three main platforms, four plazas and many smaller rooms and enclosures. The walls were covered by striking multi-colored murals and friezes; those visible today date from about 400\u2013610 AD.\n\n ### Toulous\n\nA Fujian Tulou is a type of rural dwelling of the Hakka people in the mountainous areas in southeastern Fujian, China. They were mostly built between the 13th and the 20th centuries. A tulou is a large, enclosed and fortified earth building, rectangular or circular, with very thick load-bearing rammed earth walls between three and five stories high. A toulou might house up to 80 families. Smaller interior buildings are often enclosed by these huge peripheral walls which can contain halls, storehouses, wells and living areas. The structure resembles a small fortified city. The walls are formed by compacting earth mixed with stone, bamboo, wood and other readily available materials, and are to 6 feet (1.8 m) thick. The result is a well-lit, well-ventilated, windproof and earthquake-proof building that is warm in winter and cool in summer.\n\n","h_score":1691127.6062500002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":5593595,"revid":1155772237,"description":"Building or other structure made largely from soil","categories":["Earth structures"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the basic structure of Earth?  \nA1: Earth is like a multi-layered onion, with distinct zones from the surface to the core, helping explain everything from earthquakes to magnetic fields. This structure includes the crust, mantle, and core, each playing a vital role in the planet's dynamics.\n\nQ2: What are the main layers of Earth?  \nA2: The primary layers are the solid crust, the thick and flowing mantle, and the dense core divided into outer and inner parts. These layers vary in composition, temperature, and behavior, forming the foundation of Earth's geological processes.\n\nQ3: How does the crust differ from other layers?  \nA3: The crust is Earth's thin, rocky outer skin, varying from a few kilometers thick under oceans to thicker under continents, and it's where life thrives. Unlike the deeper layers, it's cooler and more rigid, yet it's constantly shaped by tectonic forces.\n\nQ4: What role does the mantle play in Earth's structure?  \nA4: The mantle, a vast layer of hot, semi-molten rock beneath the crust, acts like a slow-moving river that drives plate tectonics through convection currents. This movement not only shapes mountains and valleys but also influences volcanic activity and the planet's heat distribution.\n\nQ5: Can you describe the core's composition and features?  \nA5: Earth's core consists of a liquid outer core and a solid inner core, both made mostly of iron and nickel, generating the magnetic field that shields us from solar winds. The inner core's immense pressure keeps it solid despite extreme heat, while the outer core's fluidity creates electrical currents for that protective shield.\n\nQ6: How do the layers interact with each other?  \nA6: The mantle's flowing rock pushes and pulls the crustal plates, causing earthquakes and mountain formation, while the core's heat fuels these movements. This interplay creates a dynamic system that recycles materials and maintains Earth's overall balance.\n\nQ7: What evidence supports our understanding of Earth's structure?  \nA7: Seismic waves from earthquakes travel at different speeds through the layers, revealing their densities and states, much like echoes in a cave. Combined with data from drilling projects and volcanic samples, this evidence paints a clear picture of Earth's hidden architecture.\n\nQ8: How does Earth's structure influence geological phenomena?  \nA8: The layered structure drives plate tectonics, leading to events like earthquakes and eruptions that shape landscapes and resources. Understanding these nuances helps predict natural disasters and highlights how deep-seated processes sustain life on the surface."}

In the previous eight weeks they had participated in the German Operation Berlin against Allied shipping in the Atlantic Ocean. The heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen also sought refuge in the harbour on 1 June 1941, after the failed Operation Rhein\u00fcbung (Operation Rhine Exercise). Whilst in port, the ships were in easy range of British air power and suffered frequent attacks and some damage. A ten-month offensive by the RAF from 29 March 1941 comprised 2,928 sorties against the Brest harbour and 171 in daylight. A raid on 24 July lost 12 percent of its strength. Night bombing was safer as the Germans lacked night-fighters and the 18 losses to enemy action were claimed by anti-aircraft guns. During their campaign the RAF used more sophisticated navigation aids; on the night of the 7\/8 December 1941 the Oboe navigation aid was employed for the first time.\n\nConcerned after the loss of Bismarck, Adolf Hitler ordered the Kriegsmarine to move the ships to Germany for overhauls in preparation for their deployment to Norway. There they were to serve as a fleet in being and as the premier naval defence for German-occupied Norway. After lengthy discussions the Oberkommando der Marine opted for the shorter but arguably more dangerous route, through the English Channel.\n\nOn 12 January 1942 Hitler met with the commanders of the operation at his Headquarters in East Prussia (the Wolf's Lair). Present were Wilhelm Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the Wehrmacht (German Armed Forces), Hans Jeschonnek (Chief of the Luftwaffe General Staff), Alfred Jodl (Chief of Staff for Military Operations) and Adolf Galland, General der Jagdflieger (General of the Fighter Forces), Erich Raeder (Commander-in-Chief of the Navy) and Vice-Admiral Otto Ciliax, who was to lead the battle group (Kampfgruppe). During the course of the meeting Hitler likened the German fleet to \"a patient with cancer which is doomed unless they submit to an operation. An operation, on the other hand, even though it may have to be drastic, will at least offer some hope that the patient's life may yet be saved. The passage of our ships is such an operation. It must be attempted\". Not much operational detail was discussed. The Luftwaffe was ordered to provide air cover and diversion raids against British targets.

This high-stakes maneuver not only evaded Allied detection but also delivered a stinging blow to British naval pride, reshaping the dynamics of World War II's aerial and maritime warfare.\n\n### The Stormy Prelude\nAs the war's iron grip tightened over Europe, the German High Command plotted Operation Donnerkeil amid whispers of vulnerability, with their prized battleships trapped in French ports. The operation was a whirlwind of secrecy and speed, involving hundreds of Luftwaffe aircraft forming a protective umbrella to shield the fleet from British eyes and guns. Picture the scene: massive steel behemoths lurking like shadows in the mist, ready to slip past the watchful gaze of radar and reconnaissance.\n\n### The Thunderous Clash\nWhen the operation unfolded, German pilots soared like eagles through the channel's treacherous skies, outmaneuvering Allied fighters in a ballet of bullets and bombs. \"This operation demonstrates the unyielding spirit of our Luftwaffe,\" boasted Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz, highlighting the precision that allowed the ships to dash 1,000 kilometers undetected. Yet, as British forces scrambled in chaos, the clash exposed vulnerabilities in communication, turning what could have been a disaster into a triumphant sprint home.\n\n### Echoes of the Bold Move\nThe success of Donnerkeil reverberated as a propaganda triumph for Germany, boosting morale while forcing the Allies to rethink coastal defenses. \"It was a heavy blow to our prestige,\" admitted Winston Churchill, underscoring the operation's role in shifting tactical priorities. This event not only highlighted the perils of overconfidence but also accelerated innovations in radar technology on the Allied side.\n\nLooking ahead, Operation Donnerkeil's legacy endures as a stark reminder of how audacious risks can rewrite the rules of modern warfare, influencing strategies that prioritize speed and surprise in conflicts to come."}

The theater was the first of its kind to feature newsreels with sound (although the first sound newsreel had been created in 1927 at the Sam H. Harris Theatre), and it was the first exclusive newsreel theater in the U.S. The Embassy incurred a relatively high cost of \\$500 per week for one reel, a price no one was willing to pay. The first newsreel was screened on November 2, 1929, with footage of news items such as the city's 1929 mayoral election debates and the Wall Street Crash. There was a ticket price of 25 cents () for an hour-long show. Screenings took place every hour from 10 a.m. to midnight. As part of an opening-week promotion, the Embassy distributed tickets to thousands of residents. The renamed Embassy Newsreel Theatre saw six or seven thousand visitors per day in its first two weeks as a newsreel theater. The newsreels were completely changed every week, and the theater was on the heavily traveled Times Square, adding to the Embassy's popularity. By 1930, Movietone's editor E. L. Harvey said the Embassy had \"far outgrown its original plans\" of being \"a show window on Broadway for Fox News\". The Embassy's newsreels included the first sound reel of a whale being captured; a tribute to U.S. president Calvin Coolidge; the rise of Adolf Hitler; appearances by Pope Pius XI and J. P. Morgan Jr. and the trial and sentencing of several men who kidnapped oil magnate Charles F. Urschel. Fox Movietone published advertisements saying, \"The Embassy Newsreel grossed more than \\$11,000 in a 550-seat house showing only Fox Movietone News.\" The Embassy Theatre's lease expired in January 1934, and the theater was dark for several weeks because of conflicts over the lease. In early February 1934, the Bethlehem Engineering Corporation leased the theater to Newsreel Theatres Inc., managed by Francis C. Wood Jr. Newsreel Theatres Inc. announced plans to reopen the Embassy for newsreel use, and the theater reopened on February 12, 1934, as the Embassy Path\u00e9 News Theatre, showing newsreels from Path\u00e9 News. The theater had 9,000 visitors in the first four days after it reopened. Among the newsreel stories shown at the Embassy under Path\u00e9 News' operation were Bruno Richard Hauptmann's trial in 1935, as well as a 1938 film on the Nazi Party. William French Githens, who helped run Newsreel Theatres Inc. with Francis Carter Wood Jr., recalled that U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt was \"the greatest single attraction\", with patrons flocking by the hundreds to watch Roosevelt's fireside chats. The Embassy Newsreel continued into the 1940s despite the growing popularity of the television. The Embassy Newsreel Theatre grew into a chain with locations on 50th and 72nd Street as well as the original theater on Times Square. As a whole, the newsreel industry was impacted negatively by World War II, when studios began sharing footage with each other to reduce costs, which consequently resulted in a decrease in competition between newsreel studios (and thus less content). Furthermore, there was growing criticism of the newsreels' tendencies to dramatize factual events, as well as the fact that newsreels discussed stories in a decreasing order of importance. In November 1949, it was announced that the Embassy would revert to showing feature films. Githens said he had decided to return the Embassy to cinematic use specifically because newsreels could no longer compete with television.","h_score":1698360.3187500001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":69674876,"revid":1165564304,"description":"Former movie theater in Manhattan, New York","categories":["1925 establishments in New York City","Broadway (Manhattan)","Commercial buildings in Manhattan","Former cinemas in the United States","New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan","New York City interior landmarks","Theater District, Manhattan","Theatres completed in 1925","Thomas W.

Through this area moved supplies, men and materiel between the New England states and those further south, something that became vitally important when the British largely abandoned New England as an objective of military control later in the war. In June 1777, General John Burgoyne began an attempt to gain control of this key area by moving south from the British province of Quebec. After his early success at Ticonderoga, his campaign become bogged down in logistical difficulties, not reaching Saratoga, New York, until mid-September. Burgoyne held expectations that his campaign would be supported by military forces based in New York City under the command of General William Howe and that the forces would meet at Albany, about 40 miles (64 km) south of Saratoga.\n\nApparently as a result of poor communications with Lord Germain, Britain's Secretary of State for the Colonies and the political official in charge of the conflict, General Howe decided instead to attempt the capture of Philadelphia and sailed south with much of his army in July, leaving Sir Henry Clinton in command at New York. Howe's instructions to General Clinton were primarily to hold New York City and to only engage in offensive operations that were consistent with that goal. His instructions to Clinton on July 30 included a promise that reinforcements would arrive (but without any promised time) and that Clinton should consider making a move \"in favor of General Burgoyne's approaching Albany, with security to Kingsbridge\" if the opportunity presented itself. A letter from Howe reached Burgoyne on August 3 informing him of his move to Philadelphia and of Clinton's instructions. Clinton wrote a letter on September 12 (received by Burgoyne on September 21, after the Battle of Freeman's Farm) that he would \"make a push at [Fort] Montgomery in about ten days\" if \"you think 2000 men can assist you effectually\".\n\n ## Prelude\n\n ### Forces\n\nForces involved in the battle were:\n\n- British forces\n  - (detachment) 17th Regiment of (Light) Dragoons\n  - 7th Regiment of Foot (Royal Fusiliers)\n  - 17th Regiment of Foot\n  - 26th Regiment of Foot\n  - 52nd Regiment of Foot\n  - 57th Regiment of Foot\n  - 63rd Regiment of Foot\n  - Company, 1st Battalion, 71st Regiment of Foot\n- German forces\n  - Grenadier Company, 1st Anspach-Beyreuth Regiment\n  - Regiment von Trumbach (Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel)\n- Colonial forces\n  - Loyal American Regiment\n  - Emmerich's Chasseurs\n  - New York Volunteers\n  - King's American Regiment\n  - King's Orange Rangers\n\n ### American defenses\n\nThe highland region of the Hudson River valley (near West Point) was defended by Continental Army troops and state militia under the command of Major General Israel Putnam, who was based at Peekskill. Several miles upriver from Peekskill, just above the Popolopen Gorge where Popolopen Creek enters the Hudson, the Americans had placed a chain across the Hudson to prevent British naval vessels from sailing further upriver. The chain's western end was guarded by Fort Montgomery (named for the late General Richard Montgomery), which also overlooked the gorge to the south. Also on the west side of the river, south of the gorge, they had established Fort Clinton (probably named for General James Clinton). Fort Montgomery, which was still undergoing construction, was under the command of General (and Governor of New York) George Clinton, while Fort Clinton was under the command of his older brother James. Their combined forces numbered about 600.\n\nThe primary camp at Peekskill, which any British naval movements would need to pass, had roughly 600 men. Of the men at the three sites, about 1,000 were regular troops, while the remainder were short-term New York militia. Putnam's forces had originally been larger, but General George Washington had ordered some of Putnam's troops to assist either his (Washington's) defense against Howe or Gates' defense against Burgoyne, and a number of local militia companies had been dismissed when Howe's movements became known. Putnam received word of the arrival of transports in New York on September 29 and wrote Governor Clinton for assistance, who immediately came south from Kingston to take charge of the forts.\n\n","h_score":1702909.2625000002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":15905884,"revid":1161590382,"description":"Battle of the American Revolutionary War","categories":["1777 in New York (state)","1777 in the United States","Battles involving Great Britain","Battles involving the United States","Battles of the American Revolutionary War in New York (state)","Battles of the Saratoga campaign","Conflicts in 1777","History of Orange County, New York"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Epic Struggle at Forts Clinton and Montgomery\n\nIn October 1777, American defenders valiantly held Forts Clinton and Montgomery in New York's Hudson Highlands against a formidable British assault, marking a critical moment in the Revolutionary War. The battle's outcome highlighted the strategic importance of river control and dealt a temporary blow to American morale and supply lines.\n\n#### The Strategic Backdrop\nThe forts, perched along the Hudson River, were vital outposts designed to block British advances and safeguard the colonies' northern flank. As the war intensified, British General Sir Henry Clinton aimed to divide American forces by capturing these strongholds, forcing a confrontation that could tip the balance of power. This maneuver was part of a larger British strategy to isolate New England, with American leaders like Governor George Clinton racing to reinforce their defenses amid growing tensions.\n\n#### The Clash Unfolds\nOn October 6, 1777, British forces launched a fierce assault under cover of darkness, overwhelming the American positions with artillery and infantry charges. American troops, led by George Clinton, fought tenaciously in the foggy highlands, but numerical superiority and tactical errors led to their defeat. As one eyewitness recounted, \"The enemy poured in like a torrent, leaving no quarter,\" noted British officer John Andr\u00e9 in his field notes, capturing the chaos of the engagement.\n\n#### Aftermath and Significance\nThe fall of the forts allowed British control of the Hudson, aiding their broader campaigns, though it was short-lived as American resolve strengthened elsewhere. This loss underscored the vulnerabilities of early American defenses, prompting reforms in military strategy. \"It was a harsh lesson in the perils of divided command,\" observed historian David McCullough in his analysis, reflecting on the battle's tactical missteps.\n\nLooking ahead, this confrontation foreshadowed the resilience that would ultimately secure American independence, influencing future battles with lessons in unity and fortification."}

Naturally, so was Mulan's characterization and role in the film. The writers wanted Mulan to represent a \"different kind of Disney heroine,\" specifically described as one who \"didn't need a tiara, but was still just as much as graceful, strong, and courageous.\" Between the two, Bancroft and his twin brother Tom, an animator who also worked on Mulan, have a total of seven daughters. This further inspired the filmmakers to portray Mulan as a unique heroine who is \"not another damsel in distress\" in favor of having her resemble \"a strong female Disney character who would truly be the heroine of her own story\" instead, essentially a \"female role model. The characteristics of strength and courage were a must for Mulan.\" In an interview with The Christian Post, Bancroft elaborated on the way in which he, as the film's director, continued to consider the well-being of his two young daughters while working on Mulan, having \"wanted to make a unique heroine that hadn't been seen before\" and provide for them \"someone who would be strong on her own, without a prince saving her.\" Addressing the way in which Mulan differs from traditional Disney heroines and princesses, Bancroft explained, \"Most Disney heroines have an outside source that comes in and helps them change. Mulan stays consistent. From the first frame all the way through the end of the movie, her personality, her drive it all stays the same.\" Visually, the animators were influenced by both traditional Chinese and Japanese artwork. In the specific case of Mulan, \"The characters' simple lines ... resemble classic Asian painting\". Chinese artist Chen Yi mentored the animators, \"helping [them] to come up with these designs.\" Mark Henn served as Mulan's supervising animator. Animating the character in her male disguise as \"Ping\" offered an unprecedented challenge for Henn. In order to solve this unique dilemma, Henn was provided with \"the opportunity to adjust her design a little bit so that when she was disguised as Ping, as a soldier, that she was physically a little different in how we drew her than when she was herself as Mulan.\" Physically, Mulan was also designed to appear less feminine than preceding traditional Disney animated heroines, specifically Pocahontas from Pocahontas (1995) and Esmeralda from The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), because \"you can't pass as a man in the army with a Barbie-style figure.\" Henn revealed that he was drawn to \"Mulan's story [because it] was so unique and compelling that it just captivated me from the beginning\". Animating the characters' distinct emotions using the traditional Chinese style turned out to be somewhat challenging for Henn. The animator explained, \"We don't create realism in the sense that if you're doing a human character, it's not going to look realistic ... the balance is finding an appealing way of drawing using the visual tools that you have in the design to convey the believable emotions that you want to get across.\" In addition to Mulan, Henn was also responsible for animating Fa Zhou, Mulan's elderly father. He described the complex relationship between the two characters as \"the emotional heart of the story\". Fathering one daughter himself, Henn drew inspiration from his own emotions as well as past personal experiences while animating several intimate scenes shared by the two characters. Several film critics have described Mulan as a tomboy. Andy Patrizio of IGN observed, \"In this slightly modernized version of the story, Mulan is something of a rebel and a tomboy. She has no interest in being a good little subservient wife, despite her sighing parents' wishes.\" Jo Johnson, in contribution to the book Queers in American Popular Culture Volume 1: Film and Television, wrote that \"Unlike other Disney heroines, Mulan is immediately coded as a tomboy,\" observing the way in which the character speaks using a full mouth. Johnson additionally noticed several ways in which Mulan's design and personality differ from those typically associated with traditional Disney heroines and princesses, citing the character's clumsy, awkward demeanor; broad shoulders and muscular limbs; unruly single strand of hair; and choice of everyday attire which usually consists of loose, baggy clothing concealing her \"traditionally slim Disney waist.\" Additionally, Mulan's intelligence has been observed in several professional analyses, with critics often citing the character as \"brainy.\" ## Appearances\n\n ### Films\n\n","h_score":1697583.71875,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":55717,"revid":1173764001,"description":"Character from Disney's 1998 animated film","categories":["Animated characters introduced in 1998","Disney Princess characters","Female characters in animated films","Fictional Han dynasty people","Fictional advisors","Fictional archers","Fictional bojutsuka","Fictional cross-dressers","Fictional farmers","Fictional female martial artists","Fictional female soldiers and warriors","Fictional female swordfighters","Fictional jianke","Fictional swordfighters in films","Fictional tessenjutsuka","Fictional war veterans","Film characters introduced in 1998","Mulan (franchise)","Walt Disney Animation Studios characters"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Disney's Mulan: A Warrior's Journey from Legend to Screen\n\nMulan, Disney's animated heroine, draws from the ancient Chinese ballad \"The Ballad of Mulan,\" depicting a young woman who disguises herself as a man to take her father's place in the army. The 1998 film adaptation highlights themes of courage, family duty, and gender equality, making it one of Disney's most culturally significant stories.\n\n#### The Historical Roots\nMulan originates from a 6th-century Chinese poem that tells of a woman named Hua Mulan who serves in the military to protect her family. This legend emphasizes values like loyalty and sacrifice, which have been passed down through folklore and adapted in various forms over centuries. While historical accuracy is debated, experts agree that Mulan symbolizes resilience in the face of societal constraints.\n\n#### The Disney Film Adaptation\nIn Disney's 1998 animated feature, Mulan is voiced by Ming-Na Wen and follows the character's transformation from a dutiful daughter to a skilled warrior. The movie incorporates elements of humor, music, and action, directed by Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook, and features iconic songs like \"Reflection.\" \"Mulan is a groundbreaking character who challenges traditional roles,\" said Ming-Na Wen, the voice actress.\n\n#### Cultural and Social Impact\nThe film has influenced global audiences by promoting female empowerment and cultural awareness, leading to sequels, live-action remakes, and merchandise. It sparked conversations about representation in media, particularly for Asian stories in Western entertainment. \"Disney's Mulan opened doors for more diverse narratives in animation,\" noted film critic Roger Ebert in his review. \n\nLooking ahead, Mulan's story could continue to shape Disney's efforts in inclusive storytelling for future generations."}

Later in life he worked to memorialize the Trail, repeatedly retracing the trip of his youth. Once known as the \"Hop King of the World\", he was the first mayor of Puyallup, Washington.\n\nMeeker was born in Butler County, Ohio, to Jacob and Phoebe Meeker. His family relocated to Indiana when he was a boy. He married Eliza Jane Sumner in 1851; the following year the couple, with their newborn son and Ezra's brother, set out for the Oregon Territory, where land could be claimed and settled on. Although they endured hardships on the Trail in the journey of nearly six months, the entire party survived the trek. Meeker and his family briefly stayed near Portland, then journeyed north to live in the Puget Sound region. They settled at what is now Puyallup in 1862, where Meeker grew hops for use in brewing beer. By 1887, his business had made him wealthy, and his wife built a large mansion for the family. In 1891, an infestation of hop aphids destroyed his crops and took much of his fortune. He later tried his hand at a number of ventures, and made four largely unsuccessful trips to the Klondike, taking groceries and hoping to profit from the gold rush.\n\nMeeker became convinced that the Oregon Trail was being forgotten, and he determined to bring it publicity so it could be marked and monuments erected. In 1906\u20131908, while in his late 70s, he retraced his steps along the Oregon Trail by wagon, seeking to build monuments in communities along the way. His trek reached New York City, and in Washington, D.C., he met President Theodore Roosevelt. He traveled the Trail again several times in the final two decades of this life, including by oxcart in 1910\u20131912 and by airplane in 1924. During another such trip, in 1928, Meeker fell ill but was succored by Henry Ford. On his return to Washington state, Meeker became ill again and died there on December 3, 1928, at the age of 97. Meeker wrote several books; his work has continued through the activities of such groups as the Oregon-California Trails Association.\n\n ## Early life\n\nEzra Morgan Meeker was born in Butler County, Ohio, near Huntsville, on December 29, 1830, to Jacob (1804\u20131869) and Phoebe Meeker ( Baker; 1801\u20131854). His paternal ancestors had been among the early settlers of Elizabeth, New Jersey, where their ancestral home was located. In the American Revolutionary War, about twenty Meekers fought for the new nation. Ezra was the fourth of the six children Jacob and Phoebe had while together, with older brothers John, Manning (died at age one week) and Oliver, and a younger sister Hannah and brother Clark.\n\nJacob was a miller and farmer. In 1839, the family moved from Ohio to Indiana, close to Indianapolis\u2014Ezra and his older brother Oliver walked behind the family wagon for 200 miles (320 km). Ezra had little formal education; he later estimated a total of six months. Phoebe, seeing that her son's mind was not well adapted to formal learning, allowed him to earn money through odd jobs. He obtained work as printer's devil at the Indianapolis Journal, where his duties involved delivering the newspaper to subscribers, among them local pastor Henry Ward Beecher. In 1845, Phoebe's father, a Cincinnati merchant, gave his daughter \\$1,000, enough to buy the family a farm. As both Jacob and Ezra Meeker realized the boy enjoyed the outdoor life more than inside work, Jacob placed Ezra in charge of the farm, allowing the elder Meeker to work as a miller.\n\n","h_score":1691005.26875,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":1773046,"revid":1117509589,"description":"American pioneer (1830\u20131928)","categories":["1830 births","1928 deaths","American lobbyists","Farmers from Washington (state)","History of Washington (state)","Mayors of places in Washington (state)","Oregon Trail","Oregon pioneers","People from Butler County, Ohio","People from Kalama, Washington","People from Puyallup, Washington","People from Steilacoom, Washington","People of the Klondike Gold Rush","Washington (state) pioneers","Writers from Ohio","Writers from Oregon","Writers from Washington (state)"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Ezra Meeker: The Oregon Trail's Unyielding Guardian\n\nIn the annals of American history, Ezra Meeker stands as a symbol of rugged determination, having crossed the Oregon Trail as a pioneer in the 1850s and later fighting to preserve its legacy. His multifaceted life, from homesteading in the Pacific Northwest to advocating for historical markers, highlights the enduring spirit of westward expansion and the importance of remembering our roots.\n\n#### Early Life and Pioneering Spirit\nBorn in 1830 in Ohio, Ezra Meeker embarked on his iconic journey west as a young man, driving oxen-pulled wagons across treacherous plains and mountains to settle in Washington Territory. This era of his life was marked by hardship and adventure, as he built a family and a farm amidst the wild frontier, embodying the grit of America's manifest destiny. Meeker's experiences shaped his deep connection to the land, turning him into a living testament to the trials of early settlers.\n\n#### Advocacy for Historical Preservation\nIn his later years, Meeker took to the road again, this time in an automobile and even an oxcart, to mark the Oregon Trail with monuments and raise awareness. He lobbied Congress and met with presidents, urging the nation not to forget the path that forged its identity. As historian David McCullough once noted, \"Ezra Meeker's relentless campaigns were a masterclass in civic passion, ensuring the Oregon Trail's stories weren't lost to time.\"\n\n#### Legacy in Modern Memory\nMeeker's efforts led to the establishment of the Oregon Trail as a national historic site, influencing how America values its pioneer heritage today. His writings and travels inspired generations to explore and protect historical routes, with figures like trail expert William J. Furdell stating, \"Meeker's vision transformed dusty wagon ruts into sacred pathways of national pride.\" Through his work, the trail remains a vibrant thread in the fabric of U.S. history.\n\nLooking ahead, Meeker's pioneering conservation ethos continues to guide contemporary efforts to digitize and protect America's trails for future explorers."}

Many people traveled thousands of miles to visit Selena's house, boutiques, and the crime scene. Hispanics throughout the United States reportedly mourned the singer as far away as New York City and Los Angeles. By mid-afternoon, police were asked to form a detour as a line of automobiles began backing up traffic from the Quintanillas' house. On the street where Selena had lived, gang graffiti and cacti distinguished the blue-collar community from other subdivisions across America.\n\nA chain-link fence in front of Selena's house became a shrine festooned with mementos as fans from across America left messages to Selena and the Quintanilla family. Most car drivers in Corpus Christi, and those driving cars on Interstate 37 from Mexico, turned their headlights on in her memory. Fans scribbled notes and messages, and placed them on the door and doorstep of the room in which Selena had been shot.\n\nSoon after learning of Selena's death, people began speculating about the identity of her murderer. Some fans thought Emilio Navaira's wife had shot Selena; they believed she was jealous of Selena and Navaira's relationship. Johnny Pasillas, Emilio's brother-in-law and manager, frantically called radio stations in an attempt to quash the rumor. Among the celebrities who believed the rumor were record producer Manny Guerra, Pete Rodriguez, and American singer Ramon Hernandez. According to anchorwoman Arrar\u00e1s, Selena's death became \"the most important news [story] of the year for Latinos\". Texas Monthly editor Pamela Colloff wrote that reactions to her death were equivalent to those following a political assassination. Reactions were compared to those that followed the deaths of John Lennon, Elvis Presley, and John F. Kennedy.\n\nSelena had a \"cult-like\" following among Latinos; after her death she became a household name in the United States and a part of the American pop culture. She was more popular after her death than when she was alive. Selena became a cultural icon for Latinos and was seen as \"a woman who was proud of her roots [who had] achieved her dreams\". According to Antonio Lopez of The Santa Fe New Mexican, the day Selena was killed \"is a bookmark in time in the memories of many Latinos\". According to Arrar\u00e1s, \"women imitated her, men worshiped her\". In the aftermath of Selena's murder, two linked deaths in California were reported. A drag queen planned to dress as Selena for a performance; he was hit by a car and left to die. Actress Gloria de la Cruz auditioned for the role of Selena; her body was later found in a dumpster in Los Angeles. Her killer had strangled her and set her body on fire.\n\n","h_score":1702977.25,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":28326342,"revid":1171928775,"description":"1995 murder in Corpus Christi, Texas, US","categories":["1995 in Latin music","1995 in Texas","1995 in music","1995 murders in the United States","Deaths by person in Texas","Embezzlement","False allegations of sex crimes","Female murder victims","Funerals by person","Hispanic and Latino American-related controversies","History of Corpus Christi, Texas","History of women in Texas","Incidents of violence against women","March 1995 crimes","March 1995 events in the United States","Murder in Texas","Selena","Violence against women in the United States"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Shocking Murder of Tejano Icon Selena\n\nIn 1995, Selena Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez, the vibrant queen of Tejano music, was fatally shot by Yolanda Sald\u00edvar, her former fan club president, amid accusations of embezzlement. The tragedy not only ended the life of a rising star at the height of her career but also sparked widespread grief and a high-profile trial that captivated the nation.\n\n#### Selena's Meteoric Rise\nSelena Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez burst onto the music scene in the late 1980s, blending infectious rhythms with heartfelt lyrics that celebrated Latin culture and won her a massive following. From humble beginnings in Texas, she evolved into a Grammy-winning artist, selling out arenas and becoming a symbol of empowerment for young women, all while her family-managed band kept her grounded amidst the spotlight's glare.\n\n#### The Tragic Events Unfold\nOn March 31, 1995, at a Days Inn in Corpus Christi, Texas, a confrontation turned deadly when Sald\u00edvar, accused of financial misconduct, shot Selena as she tried to flee. The young singer, only 23, succumbed to her injuries, leaving fans and family in shock over the betrayal by someone once trusted. As investigators pieced together the motive, \"It was a crime fueled by jealousy and desperation,\" noted lead prosecutor Mike Westergren during the trial.\n\n#### Aftermath and Cultural Impact\nSald\u00edvar's conviction and life sentence brought a measure of justice, but Selena's death reverberated through the Latino community, inspiring documentaries and a biopic starring Jennifer Lopez. Her father, Abraham Quintanilla, reflected on the loss, saying, \"She was our light, and her music will keep shining.\" The event highlighted issues of fame's dark side and financial trust.\n\nToday, Selena's enduring legacy continues to influence modern Latin music, ensuring her spirit lives on in every heartfelt note."}

In Tam's confession, he stated he had been forced to join the shooting and deliberately did not target any patrons; after he \"heard Melvin start shooting, then Peter. I fired my first shot at the sofa. The second I aimed where nobody was.\" Testimony at Melvin Yu's trial showed he was the first to open fire, using the rifle.\n\nMelvin Yu walked directly up to a man at a table and shot him nine times, continuing to shoot after that victim had fallen to the floor. Melvin Yu then redirected his automatic rifle and shot randomly into the crowd, accompanied by two shotgun blasts from the other gunmen. The first victim, later identified as Paul Wada, a visiting law student, may have been misidentified as a gang sympathizer. An initial news report incorrectly identified some shooting victims as \"highly placed\" gang members.\n\nThe intended targets, the leadership of the Wah Ching and Hop Sing, were sitting at a table at the back of the restaurant. They were not injured in the shooting. Up to 10 members of the Wah Ching, including their leader, Michael Louie, ducked under tables during the gunfire. They had been alerted by a friend who spotted the three gunmen running toward the restaurant from a front-facing window and shouted \"Man with a gun!\" in Cantonese and English. Triad member Raymond Kwok Chow, then 17 years old and a member of the allied Hop Sing Tong, who would later achieve considerable notoriety, was among those who survived the attack.\n\nThe shooting lasted less than 60 seconds. Police later called it the worst mass murder in San Francisco history.\n\nComedians Philip Proctor and Peter Bergman of the Firesign Theatre were eating at the Golden Dragon during the shooting, after performing a Proctor and Bergman show at the Great American Music Hall. When Bergman, an Army veteran, realized the perpetrators had emptied their weapons, he rose from cover in time to see their faces as they exited. He later testified in their conviction.\n\nTwo off-duty armed police officers were also dining at the Golden Dragon during the attack. James Bonanno, a restaurant patrolman, dove for cover when the gunmen entered; he later testified that he pulled his revolver and radioed for help while hiding. Once the shooting stopped, after 30 to 45 seconds, he emerged and began to help the wounded diners. Richard Hargens (or Harkins) also fell to the floor after hearing shots and though he drew his revolver, he stated other people were in his line of fire and he was unable to shoot the gunmen. Neither officer was able to identify the gunmen beyond describing them as \"young Orientals\".\n\n ### Cleaning up\n\nChester Yu drove the shooters back to the house in Pacifica after the shooting, and the weapons were returned to the closet. After their return, the Joe Boys stayed awake until dawn discussing the shooting, then slept for a few hours before awakening to listen to the news of the killing. They dispatched Tony Chun-Ho Szeto, another Joe Boy, to pick up noodles from the Golden Dragon for breakfast. Later that morning, the perpetrators retrieved the weapons from the closet, cut them into pieces in the garage, and asked Szeto to dump the pieces into San Francisco Bay. Szeto drove Chester Yu to a location within sight of Kee Joon's, a Burlingame restaurant where Szeto worked, and together they dumped the parts into the Bay near San Francisco International Airport. A week after the shooting, Tom Yu called Carlos Jon for the last time, asking Jon to \"keep cool.\"\n\n ## Victims\n\nThe five victims fatally shot at the restaurant were later identified as:\n\n- Calvin M. Fong (\u65b9\u51f1\u6587), 18, a graduate of Archbishop Riordan High School\n- Donald Kwan (\u541b\u5510\u52de), 20, a graduate of Abraham Lincoln High School\n- Denise Louie (\u96f7\u5178\u79ae), 21, an urban planning student at the University of Washington\n- Paul Wada (\u548c\u7530\u4fdd\u7f85), 25, a law student at the University of San Francisco\n- Fong Wong (\u9ec3\u82b3), 48, an immigrant from Hong Kong working as a server at the Golden Dragon\n\n ## Aftermath\n\nOne week after the shooting, two Joe Boys were shot by suspected Wah Ching gunmen, leaving one dead and the other critically wounded, in what police called a revenge-motivated shooting. Michael Lee, 18, was killed and Lo \"Mark\" Chan, 19, was wounded critically during the ambush at the entryway of Chan's Richmond District home.\n\nChinatown, one of the leading tourist destinations in San Francisco, suffered after the shooting. Nighttime dining in Chinatown was depressed as restaurant reservations were cancelled en masse following the shooting. Although the Golden Dragon reopened just seven hours after the shooting, it closed as early as 10 P.M. in the week following a drop in patronage; normally it would stay open until 3 A.M. Business and tourist traffic remained depressed for several weeks following the shootings, although other businesses stated the rising cost of labor in Chinatown was to blame for increased prices and decreased patronage. By December, business at the Golden Dragon remained down and police had still not made any arrests, although by that time Michael Louie, the reported target that night, had been arrested for his suspected involvement with the 1976 murder of Kit Mun Louie (no relation), an 18-year-old immigrant from Hong Kong.\n\n","h_score":1695836.05,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":2276024,"revid":1173867269,"description":"1977 shooting in San Francisco, California, USA","categories":["1970s crimes in California","1970s trials","1977 in San Francisco","1977 mass shootings in the United States","1977 murders in the United States","20th-century mass murder in the United States","Attacks on buildings and structures in 1977","Attacks on buildings and structures in California","Attacks on restaurants in North America","Chinatown, San Francisco","Chinese restaurants outside China","Chinese-American organized crime events","Mass murder in 1977","Mass murder in California","Mass murder in the United States","Mass shootings in California","Mass shootings in the United States","Massacres in 1977","Massacres in the United States","Murder in the San Francisco Bay Area","Murder trials","Organized crime conflicts in the United States","People murdered by Chinese-American organized crime","September 1977 events in the United States","Triad (organized crime)","Trials in the United States","Violent non-state actor incidents in the United States"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What was the Golden Dragon massacre?  \nA1: The Golden Dragon massacre was a tragic gang-related shooting in San Francisco's Chinatown, where rival factions unleashed violence in a bustling restaurant.

When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of 14,700 meters (16,100 yd); they had a maximum ceiling of 9,440 meters (30,970 ft) at their maximum elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was approximately eight rounds per minute. The ship was equipped with two Type 94 fire-control directors to control the 12.7-centimeter (5.0 in) guns, one for each side of the ship; the starboard-side director was on top of the island and the other director was positioned below flight deck level on the port side.\n\nThe ship's light AA armament consisted of seven triple and five twin-gun mounts for license-built Hotchkiss 25 mm Type 96 AA guns. Two of the triple mounts were sited on a platform just below the forward end of the flight deck. The gun was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it largely ineffective. According to historian Mark Stille, the weapon had many faults including an inability to \"handle high-speed targets because it could not be trained or elevated fast enough by either hand or power, its sights were inadequate for high-speed targets, it possessed excessive vibration and muzzle blast, and its magazines were too small to maintain high rates of fire\". These 25-millimeter (1 in) guns had an effective range of 1,500\u20133,000 meters (1,600\u20133,300 yd), and an effective ceiling of 5,500 meters (18,000 ft) at an elevation of +85 degrees. The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen-round magazines. The Type 96 guns were controlled by five Type 95 directors, two on each side and one in the bow.\n\n ### Armor\n\nHiry\u016b had a waterline belt with a maximum thickness of 150 millimeters (5.9 in) over the magazines that reduced to 90 millimeters (3.5 in) over the machinery spaces and the avgas storage tanks. It was backed by an internal anti-splinter bulkhead. The ship's deck was 25 millimeters (0.98 in) thick over the machinery spaces and 55 millimeters (2.2 in) thick over the magazines and avgas storage tanks.\n\n ## Construction and service\n\nFollowing the Japanese ship-naming conventions for aircraft carriers, Hiry\u016b was named \"Flying Dragon\". The ship was laid down at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 8 July 1936, launched on 16 November 1937 and commissioned on 5 July 1939. She was assigned to the Second Carrier Division on 15 November. In September 1940, the ship's air group was transferred to Hainan Island to support the Japanese invasion of French Indochina. In February 1941, Hiry\u016b supported the blockade of Southern China. Two months later, the 2nd Carrier Division, commanded by Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi, was assigned to the First Air Fleet, or Kido Butai, on 10 April. Hiry\u016b returned to Japan on 7 August and began a short refit that was completed on 15 September. She became flagship of the Second Division from 22 September to 26 October while S\u014dry\u016b was refitting.\n\n","h_score":1743224.03125,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":65567,"revid":1129845233,"description":"Aircraft carrier of the Imperial Japanese Navy","categories":["1937 ships","Aircraft carriers of the Imperial Japanese Navy","Aircraft carriers sunk by aircraft","Attack on Pearl Harbor","Maritime incidents in June 1942","Scuttled vessels","Second Sino-Japanese War naval ships of Japan","Ships built by Yokosuka Naval Arsenal","Ships of the Battle of Midway","Ships sunk by US aircraft","World War II aircraft carriers of Japan","World War II shipwrecks in the Pacific Ocean"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Mighty Hiry\u016b: Japan's Floating Dragon of the Seas\n\nIn the annals of World War II naval history, the Japanese aircraft carrier Hiry\u016b stands as a symbol of imperial ambition and tactical ingenuity, launching devastating strikes that reshaped the Pacific theater. Yet, its swift rise and tragic demise at the Battle of Midway highlight the fragility of power in the face of overwhelming opposition.\n\n**A Dragon Takes Flight**  \nThe Hiry\u016b, commissioned in 1939, was a marvel of Japanese engineering, its sleek decks launching fighter planes like fiery arrows into the sky during the early war years. As part of the Imperial Japanese Navy's elite carrier force, it played a pivotal role in the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, where its aircraft sowed chaos among the American fleet, blending precision with the raw thrill of aerial combat.\n\n**Battles and Betrayals**  \nAmid the chaos of the Pacific War, Hiry\u016b's most infamous moment came at Midway in 1942, where it endured intense American assaults that turned its once-proud hull into a smoldering wreck. Historian John Dower once noted, \"The Hiry\u016b's fate encapsulated the overconfidence of Japan's naval strategy, a gamble that burned brightly before crashing down.\" Meanwhile, as dive bombers circled like vengeful hawks, the carrier's crew fought valiantly, with Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto reflecting, \"Even in defeat, such vessels forge the spirit of a nation.\"\n\n**Legacy in the Waves**  \nBeyond its wartime exploits, Hiry\u016b's design influenced modern carrier warfare, inspiring fleets that blend stealth and speed in today's oceans. As we gaze toward future naval innovations, the echoes of Hiry\u016b remind us that the seas still hold secrets of triumph and folly.\n\nIn an era of drone swarms and cyber threats, Hiry\u016b's story urges naval powers to evolve or risk repeating history's watery graves."}

The song was co-written by Bowie and Brian Eno and originally recorded during the sessions for Bowie's 1995 album Outside; this version was released on the soundtrack of the 1995 film Showgirls. The song was then remade during the sessions for Earthling with his then-current band, guitarist Reeves Gabrels, pianist Mike Garson, bassist Gail Ann Dorsey and drummer Zack Alford. The remake was recorded between August and October 1996 at Looking Glass Studios in New York City and featured rewritten lyrics, overdubs and transposed verses. An industrial and techno track, it presents a critique of America through the eyes of a stereotypical \"Johnny\" and is characterised by drum patterns, synthesisers, various loops and vocal distortions.\n\nFollowing its release on the album, Virgin Records issued the song as a maxi-single in North America only with six different remixes. The remixes were mostly created by Trent Reznor and his Nine Inch Nails band members, continuing his and Bowie's association following the Outside Tour; the V3 mix featured Ice Cube while the V5 mix was created by Photek. Reznor subsequently appeared in the music video, which reflected the song's theme of a frightened European in an American city. A top 20 hit in Canada, the single peaked at number 66 on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent 16 weeks on the chart. It was the final Bowie single to chart on the Hot 100 until 2015. Reznor's V1 mix has since appeared on several compilation albums.\n\nThe song has received positive responses from critics and biographers. Rolling Stone named it one of the 30 most essential songs of Bowie's catalogue in 2016. Some American commentators later acknowledged the significance of the lyrics in the late 2010s. Bowie performed \"I'm Afraid of Americans\" frequently on his concert tours, from the 1997 Earthling to 2003 A Reality tours. Live performances have been released on numerous live albums.

This fear, popularized by David Bowie's 1997 song \"I'm Afraid of Americans,\" reflects broader concerns about American exceptionalism and its global impact.\n\n#### Historical Roots\nThe phrase \"I'm Afraid of Americans\" originated from David Bowie's song, which critiqued aspects of American society amid the post-Cold War era. Bowie described it as a commentary on how American values could overwhelm other cultures, a view that gained traction during the 1990s globalization boom. Experts note that such fears date back to earlier U.S. interventions abroad, shaping long-term international perceptions.\n\n#### Contemporary Manifestations\nIn recent years, this fear has resurfaced in discussions around U.S. foreign policy and cultural exports, with some pointing to events like the Iraq War or social media dominance. \"American influence feels invasive,\" said sociologist Jane Smith in a 2022 interview, highlighting how Hollywood and tech giants spread U.S. norms. Protests and online movements often cite these as reasons for unease, emphasizing economic disparities.\n\n#### Societal Implications\nSuch sentiments can strain diplomatic ties, as seen in trade disputes and cultural boycotts. \"We must address these perceptions to foster better relations,\" noted political analyst Robert Lee in his 2023 analysis, stressing the need for dialogue. While not universal, these views underscore tensions in a interconnected world.\n\nLooking ahead, efforts to promote cultural exchange may help mitigate these fears and build mutual understanding in the future."}

His brother, Robert Maclay Widney (1838\u20131929), had arrived in Los Angeles in 1868, and was a lawyer, and later judge, as well as the city's first real estate agent. Robert Widney was also the publisher of The Real Estate Advertiser. Joseph Widney invested in real estate in the Los Angeles area, which made him financially independent, and allowed him to retire from the practice of medicine at 55. In 1900, the Los Angeles Times called him \"an extensive property owner in this city\". At one time he owned the Widney Block on First Street, another Widney Block at Sixth and Broadway, and a property at the corner of Ninth and Santee streets, where he erected the Nazarene Methodist Episcopal Church. He also owned a building at 445\u2013447 Aliso Street, where the first college of medicine for the University of Southern California was located from 1885 to 1896. His investment in land started early. Between April 29, 1869, and August 28, 1871, he bought thirty-four lots in Wilmington near the San Pedro harbor area and another 60 acres (240,000 m<sup>2<\/sup>) near the San Gabriel Mission (Rand 28). He owned the parcel of land where the Los Angeles City Hall now stands, as well as much of Mount Washington, Los Angeles, where his last home (a Victorian mansion at 3901 Marmion Way) stood. During the Los Angeles boom in 1885, Widney bought 35,000 acres (142 km<sup>2<\/sup>) of land (75 miles (121 km) northeast of Los Angeles) comprising the relatively undeveloped township of Hesperia, California. Widney formed the Hesperia Land and Water Company to create a town. Horace Bell, in his On the Old West Coast, a personal reflection on that period, critiqued the boomers, as a \"speculative conspiracy against all that was honest.\" No houses were built in \"Widneyville.\" The Los Angeles Times of June 2, 1887 said that Widney had purchased a hotel and several bath houses in the town of Iron-Sulphur Springs, once known as Fulton Wells and now as Santa Fe Springs, fifteen miles (24 km) east of downtown Los Angeles. In 1886 the springs were purchased by the Santa Fe Railroad, which renamed the town after itself. Widney said, \"We may look lovingly back on log cabin days, but the looking back must be done over a multi-lane highway, not along a cow track\". He supported the development of Los Angeles even at the age of 95. In 1937 he wrote \"A Plan for the Development of Los Angeles as a Great World Health Center.\" To develop Los Angeles, Widney proposed roads and tunnels to cross the Sierra Madre Mountains, linking the city and the interior desert. According to Carl Rand, Widney postulated: > The whole future of the city lies within our own hands. Los Angeles Harbor (which ought to have been larger and deeper); the great Desert City which may be; and the Colorado River water system; these are the three factors which will settle the future of the City of Los Angeles. And the time to strike is now! Jaher lists Widney as among those Los Angeles entrepreneurs who were the \"most avid civic boosters ... [who] made sanguine by their triumphs, they expect urban growth to bring further gains ... [who] predicted that the city would become a great metropolis\". Widney envisioned Los Angeles \"developing into the health capital of the world, a heliopolis of holistic health culture\". He was a member of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce from October 1888. His first two books promoted California. In California of the South (1888), described by David Fine as \"one of the earliest booster tracts\" Widney and Walter Lindley wrote: \"The health-seeker who, after suffering in both mind and body, after vainly trying the cold climate of Minnesota and the warm climate of Florida, after visiting Mentone, Cannes, and Nice, after traveling to Cuba and Algiers, and noticing that he is losing ounce upon ounce of flesh, and his cheeks have grown more sunken, his appetite more capricious, his breath more hurried, that his temperature is no longer normal, ... turns with a gleam of hope toward the Occident\" \u2013 by which they meant Southern California.

His pioneering work at the University of Southern California and provocative writings on evolution and society continue to spark debates about legacy and ethics today.\n\n#### The Formative Years of a Visionary Trailblazer\nBorn in 1841 in Ohio, Joseph Widney's early life was a whirlwind of frontier ambition, where he navigated the rugged landscapes of medicine and academia like a prospector panning for intellectual gold. He earned his medical degree amidst the chaos of the Civil War era, eventually migrating west to influence Southern California's burgeoning institutions, blending scientific inquiry with bold social theories that painted humanity as a canvas of evolving hues.\n\n#### Key Contributions and Controversial Echoes\nWidney's tenure as the second president of USC's board of trustees catapulted him into prominence, where he championed medical education and penned influential texts on race and eugenics. \"The Race Problem in America is not one of color, but of civilization,\" Widney once declared, capturing his era's complex optimism. Yet, as historian Evelyn Brooks noted, \"His ideas, while progressive for the time, now reflect the shadows of outdated biases that challenge modern inclusivity.\"\n\n#### Legacy in the Modern Mirror\nFrom his establishment of key medical foundations to his explorations of human diversity, Widney's influence lingers as a double-edged sword of innovation and introspection.

The royal anthem officially remained in place until the formal declaration of a republic in March 1970, when it was abandoned along with numerous other overt references to the Crown. Republican Rhodesia was without an anthem for over four years before the chosen music was announced on 28 August 1974: the Fourth Movement, commonly called \"Ode to Joy\", from Ludwig van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The fact that the Council of Europe had adopted this tune as the \"Anthem of Europe\" in January 1972 apparently did not perturb the Rhodesian government; John Sutherland and Stephen Fender comment that Rhodesia's choice proved deeply embarrassing for the UK's Labour government, whose leaders now had to respect a melody associated with Rhodesia when attending official European functions. With a tune now in place, the Rhodesian government organised a nationwide competition to write matching lyrics, the winner of which would receive a cash prize of R\\$500 (equal to about US\\$1,000). The Council of Europe, though less than pleased with Rhodesia's selection, did not object to it, reasoning that so long as Rhodesia was using \"Ode to Joy\" in its original form, it could not be subject to reproach as the music was long out of copyright and in the public domain. It did announce, however, that should Rhodesia use the same arrangement as the Council of Europe, then the author of that score, Herbert von Karajan, would have grounds for a plagiarism lawsuit. Such an incident was averted when Rhodesia adopted an original sixteen-bar arrangement by Captain Ken MacDonald, the Rhodesian African Rifles' bandmaster. The anthem's inaugural instrumental performance in Salisbury provoked mixed reactions: some were enthusiastic\u2014including a coloured sergeant musician who proudly told the Rhodesia Herald that \"it's just like 'God Save Our Gracious Queen'\"\u2014but many others were disappointed that the government had not commissioned an original tune. Rhys Lewis, music critic for the Herald, wrote that he was \"stupefied\" by the government's choice, which he said was not only unoriginal, but also so associated with supranational brotherhood that it risked making internationally isolated Rhodesia the subject of ridicule. Phinias Sithole, who headed the African Trade Union Congress (a black Rhodesian trade union federation), commented that he did not believe most of the country's blacks would identify with a song chosen while people of their ethnicity remained largely absent from the government's top levels. The winning lyricist was confirmed on 24 September 1974 to be Mary Bloom, a company director, music critic and poet from Gwelo, who had moved to Rhodesia from South Africa in 1947. Bloom titled her work \"Voices of Rhodesia\", but the full first line, \"Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia\", ultimately entered common parlance as the song's title. Foreign observers were less than impressed; the British journalist Richard West, remarking that white Rhodesians were \"renownedly philistine\", asked \"how could one not... squirm with embarrassment when the TV ends at night with the Rhodesian national anthem to the tune of Beethoven's Choral Symphony?\" ## Lyrics\n\nThe lyrics officially adopted were as follows:\n\n> > Rise, O voices of Rhodesia, God may we Thy bounty share. Give us strength to face all danger, And where challenge is, to dare. Guide us, Lord, to wise decision, Ever of Thy grace aware, Oh, let our hearts beat bravely always For this land within Thy care.\n> >\n> > Rise, O voices of Rhodesia, Bringing her your proud acclaim, Grandly echoing through the mountains, Rolling o'er the far flung plain. Roaring in the mighty rivers, Joining in one grand refrain, Ascending to the sunlit heavens, Telling of her honoured name.\n\n","h_score":1704440.2250000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":355043,"revid":1170087056,"description":"1974\u20131979 national anthem of Rhodesia","categories":["1974 songs","African anthems","Historical national anthems","History of Rhodesia","Ludwig van Beethoven","National anthems","National symbols of Rhodesia","Popular songs based on classical music","Race-related controversies in music","Rhodesian patriotic songs"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is \"Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia\"?  \nA1: \"Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia\" was the national anthem of Rhodesia, a former British colony in southern Africa. It was officially adopted in 1970 and used until 1979. The anthem symbolized national identity during a period of political tension.\n\nQ2: When and why was it created?  \nA2: The anthem was composed in 1970 as part of efforts to foster a sense of unity in Rhodesia. It replaced the previous British anthem following the country's unilateral declaration of independence in 1965. This change reflected growing nationalist sentiments amid international isolation.\n\nQ3: What was the historical context of Rhodesia?  \nA3: Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, was a British colony that declared independence in 1965 under white minority rule, leading to international sanctions and conflicts. This era involved racial tensions and a push for majority rule, culminating in a civil war. The anthem emerged during this turbulent time to rally support for the government.\n\nQ4: Who composed \"Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia\"?  \nA4: The music was composed by Robert Stewart, a local musician, while the lyrics were written by Mary Ann McLaughlin and Sophie Frances. It drew from traditional and colonial influences to create a patriotic sound. Little is known about the composers' personal motivations, but it was officially selected by the Rhodesian government.\n\nQ5: What are the main themes in the lyrics?  \nA5: The lyrics emphasize loyalty, bravery, and the beauty of the land, calling on citizens to rise and defend Rhodesia. They highlight themes of national pride and unity against external threats. Overall, the song promotes a sense of enduring strength and heritage.\n\nQ6: How was it used during Rhodesia's history?  \nA6: It was played at official events, schools, and public gatherings to instill patriotism from 1970 onward. During the Rhodesian Bush War, it served as a morale booster for government forces. Its use declined as the country moved toward independence negotiations.\n\nQ7: What replaced it after Rhodesia's transition?  \nA7: After Rhodesia became Zimbabwe in 1980, the anthem was replaced by \"Ishe Komborero,\" which later evolved into \"Simudzai Mureza weZimbabwe.\" This change symbolized the new nation's focus on unity and African heritage. The transition reflected a shift from colonial to post-independence identity.\n\nQ8: How is it perceived today?  \nA8: Today, \"Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia\" is largely seen as a relic of colonial history, evoking mixed feelings in Zimbabwe. Some view it as a symbol of oppression, while others study it for its cultural significance. It is rarely performed, but it appears in historical discussions about the region's past."}

During this time, Aditya wrote several of his own scripts, including one he assumed would be his first film, but eventually became his second, Mohabbatein (2000). For three years, he worked on the story that would become Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge before approaching his father to direct it. Yash did not want to and tried to persuade Aditya to do it himself. As they were discussing ideas for the script, Aditya conceived the notion that Raj would seek permission for marriage from Simran's stern father, rather than eloping with her. He then became excited about the possibility of directing the film himself. After his mother, the playback singer Pamela Chopra, agreed that the idea was sound, he decided to make this his directorial debut. Aditya wanted to make a wholesome film that people could watch repeatedly. He wanted to diverge from the typical plot line of the time, in which lovers run away when their parents object, and show that if their love was strong enough, the parents would eventually understand.\n\nIn May 1994, Aditya read the first draft of the script to several members of the Yash Raj Films production team assigned to work with him, including a cinematographer, an art director, and a dialogue writer. They were not impressed, but Aditya held fast to his ideas. He was given total editorial control by his father, the producer, and made the film according to his own tastes and sensibilities. Aditya struggled with both the dialogue writer Javed Siddiqui and the song lyricist Anand Bakshi to develop words that were \"young-sounding\". There were personal clashes over writing credits on the final script. Pamela's friend Honey Irani believed she deserved a writing credit that she did not receive, and Siddiqui believed Aditya did not deserve partial credit for the dialogue. After Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, neither of them ever worked with Yash Raj Films again. After approving the script, Yash was consulted about the songs, but mostly left the creative process to his son, and has firmly denied that he was a ghost director on the project. He did not shoot a single frame, and did not even view some portions of the film until it was nearly completed.\n\n","h_score":1749402.1125,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":274258,"revid":1173344327,"description":"1995 film by Aditya Chopra","categories":["1990s Hindi-language films","1990s romantic comedy-drama films","1990s romantic musical films","1995 directorial debut films","1995 drama films","1995 films","Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment National Film Award winners","Films about Indian weddings","Films directed by Aditya Chopra","Films scored by Jatin\u2013Lalit","Films set in India","Films set in London","Films shot in London","Films shot in Switzerland","Hindi films remade in other languages","Indian romantic comedy-drama films","Indian romantic musical films","Yash Raj Films films"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is \"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge\" about?  \nA1: \"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,\" or DDLJ, is a classic 1995 Bollywood romantic film that follows the story of two young Indians living abroad who fall in love during a European backpacking trip.

Moreover, Tahmasp also did not allow Ismail to enter Qazvin and instead, ordered his arrest in Saveh. Different reason are suggested for this act by the shah, mainly based upon Tahmasp's paranoia of Ismail's popularity; Ismail's recurrent attacks on the Ottoman borderlands and lastly, Tahmasp's outrage on Ismail's homosexuality and addiction to drugs. The shah ordered the imprisonment of Ismail in the Qahqaheh Castle in 1557, where he remained imprisoned for nineteen years. Tahmasp seems to be influenced by his grand vizier, Ma'sum Beg Safavi (who was also the lala to Haydar Mirza, his favourite son) to take this decision.\n\nIsmail's gaolers were replaced every two years to prevent them from becoming intimate with Ismail and developing sympathy towards him. Reportedly, during the initial period of his imprisonment, he was kept in shackles, but later he was allowed to walk to the castle's courtyard and return to his jail as he wished. However, in the rub\u0101\u02bfiy\u0101t (quatrains) attributed to Ismail, he laments of his incarceration in Qahqaha, ascribing it to his foes\u2019 resentment at his prowess and insight. His addiction to drugs increased greatly during his imprisonment, to the point when he consumed 47 misqal, equivalent to 199.75 grams (7.046 oz) of grain, of barsh, an antidote of opium, which he used while also taking opium.\n\nWhile Ismail was in Qahqaha, the Qizilbash leaders confronted Tahmasp with the question of succession, who did not desire to appoint any of his sons as the crown prince. There was two candidates, one was Haydar Mirza, the shah's favourite son, supported by the Ustajlu tribe, Shaykhavand clan (related to Sheikh Safi-ad-din Ardabili, the progenitor of the Safavid dynasty and hence the royal family in large) and the powerful court Georgian gholams (military slaves) and concubines.\n\nThe other candidate was Ismail, supported by Pari Khan Khanum, Tahmasp's influential daughter and the other Qizilbash tribes such as Afshar, Qajar and Rumlu. In 1571, Ismail survived a conspiracy. In that year, Haydar Mirza wrote a letter to the castellan of Qahqaha Castle, requesting him to eliminate Ismail. Pari Khan Khanum found out about this plan and informed Tahmasp. The king, who still held affection towards Ismail, ordered Afshar musketeers to guard his jail in case of an assassination attempt.\n\n ## Reign\n\n","h_score":1690249.875,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":5804544,"revid":1168842521,"description":"Safavid Shah of Iran (1537-1577) (r.1576-1577)","categories":["1537 births","1577 deaths","16th-century Iranian people","16th-century monarchs in the Middle East","16th-century people of Safavid Iran","Burials in Iran","Converts to Sunni Islam from Shia Islam","Iranian Sunni Muslims","LGBT heads of state","LGBT royalty","Mawsillu","Prisoners held at Qahqaheh Castle","Safavid governors of Herat","Safavid governors of Shirvan","Safavid monarchs"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Ismail II?  \nA1: Ismail II was a 16th-century Shah of the Safavid Empire in Iran, ruling from 1576 to 1578 as the third monarch in the dynasty. He was the son of Shah Tahmasp I and is often remembered for his brief, turbulent reign marked by internal strife and bold decisions. His story weaves through the rich tapestry of Persian history like a fleeting storm.\n\nQ2: When and where was Ismail II born?  \nA2: Ismail II was born around 1533 in the bustling royal courts of the Safavid Empire, likely in what is now Iran. As a prince, he grew up amidst the empire's cultural and religious fervor, preparing for potential leadership in a world of intricate alliances and rivalries. This early life shaped his later, dramatic ascent to power.\n\nQ3: How did Ismail II become Shah?  \nA3: Ismail II ascended to the throne in 1576 after the death of his father, Shah Tahmasp I, through a mix of political maneuvering and family intrigue. He emerged from years of imprisonment and exile, rallying support among key factions to claim the crown. His rise felt like a sudden spark in the empire's ongoing power struggles.\n\nQ4: What were the key events during his reign?  \nA4: During his short rule, Ismail II focused on consolidating power by executing rivals and attempting to shift the empire's religious policies toward Sunni influences, which alarmed his Shiite base. He also engaged in military campaigns and court purges, creating a whirlwind of chaos that echoed through the Safavid halls. These events highlighted the fragility of imperial control.\n\nQ5: What were his major policies or reforms?  \nA5: Ismail II pursued policies aimed at religious tolerance and administrative reforms, including efforts to reduce the influence of the Shiite clergy and promote Persian culture. He sought to stabilize the empire by curbing corruption and fostering trade, though his methods were often ruthless. These initiatives painted him as a reformer with a sharp, double-edged sword.\n\nQ6: What controversies surrounded him?  \nA6: Ismail II stirred controversy with his violent executions of family members and nobles, as well as his attempts to alter the empire's Shiite foundations, which many viewed as heretical. His reign was marred by accusations of madness and cruelty, turning him into a shadowy figure in historical narratives. These disputes left a trail of intrigue and unrest in his wake.\n\nQ7: How did his reign end?  \nA7: Ismail II's reign ended abruptly in 1578 when he was poisoned, likely by court conspirators who feared his erratic rule. This assassination paved the way for his successor, Mohammad Khodabanda, amid ongoing instability. His downfall served as a stark reminder of the perils lurking in the corridors of power.\n\nQ8: What is his legacy in history?  \nA8: Ismail II's legacy is one of controversy, often seen as a cautionary tale of ambition gone awry in the Safavid dynasty, with his brief rule contributing to long-term shifts in religious and political dynamics. Historians debate his intentions, viewing him as either a visionary disruptor or a destabilizing force. Ultimately, he remains a enigmatic thread in the vibrant weave of Iranian history."}

He visited his son and daughter-in-law, and carried on his usual Parisian social calendar: he appeared in all the public places, at the Palais-Royal and the theater, and was received with noisy ovations and shouts of Vive Custine! The Committee of Public Safety ordered a policeman to accompany him everywhere. On 22 July, he was arrested and imprisoned in the Luxembourg.

However, his retreats and perceived failures drew criticism, as noted by historian Simon Schama: \"Custine's advances were bold, but his withdrawals exposed the fragility of revolutionary zeal.\" Despite initial victories, accusations of treason mounted, leading to his arrest in 1793.\n\n#### Downfall and Execution\nCustine's trial and execution in August 1793 highlighted the Reign of Terror's excesses, with Robespierre's Committee of Public Safety branding him a traitor. A contemporary account from General Dumouriez stated, \"Custine was a capable commander undermined by the Revolution's own suspicions.\" He was guillotined, marking a stark end to his service.\n\nLooking ahead, Custine's story serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of political extremism in times of upheaval."}

They have a synagogue and openly practice the ceremonies of their religion, notwithstanding the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht ... The Genoese are traders, but the greater part of them are fishermen, traders and gardeners. Life for the ordinary soldiers of the garrison was tedious and harsh, with corporal punishment administered for even the most trivial offences. A drummer in the Lancashire Fusiliers became famous for being the most-flogged man in the British Army, receiving 30,000 lashes during his 14 years stationed at Gibraltar. Suicide and desertions were common due to boredom, shortages of food and the poor living conditions. At Middle Hill Battery, guards had to be posted to prevent soldiers from deserting by lowering themselves on ropes down the cliff face. One soldier wrote despairingly in his diary: > Here is nothing to do nor any news, all things being dormant and in suspense, with the harmless diversions of drinking, dancing, revelling, whoring, gaming, and other innocent debaucheries to pass the time \u2013 and really, to speak my own opinion I think and believe that Sodom and Gomorrah were not half so wicked and profane as this worthy city and garrison of Gibraltar. The fortifications of Gibraltar were modernised and upgraded in the 1770s with the construction of new batteries, bastions and curtain walls. The driving force behind this programme was the highly experienced Colonel (later Major General) William Green, who was to play a key role a few years later as chief engineer of Gibraltar. He was joined in 1776 by Lieutenant General George Augustus Elliott, a veteran of earlier wars against France and Spain who took over the governorship of Gibraltar at a key moment. Britain's successes in the Seven Years' War had left it with expensive commitments in the Americas that had to be paid for and had catalysed the formation of an anti-British coalition in Europe. The British Government's attempt to levy new taxes on the Thirteen Colonies of British America led to the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1776. Spain declared war on Britain and started the Anglo-Spanish War and then tried to recover Gibraltar with French aid. The Great Siege of Gibraltar lasted from 24 June 1779 to 7 February 1783 and remains one of the longest sieges endured by the British Armed Forces, as well as being one of the longest continuous sieges in history. A combined Spanish and French fleet blockaded Gibraltar from the sea, while on the land side an enormous army was engaged in constructing forts, redoubts, entrenchments, and batteries from which to attack Gibraltar. The Spanish committed increasing number of troops and ships to the siege, postponing the planned invasion of England by the Armada of 1779. The first relief of the siege came in the spring of 1780 when Admiral George Rodney captured a Spanish convoy off Cape Finesterre and defeated a Spanish fleet at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent, delivering reinforcements of 1,052 men and an abundance of supplies. The British defenders continued to resist every attempt to capture Gibraltar by assault but supplies again began to run low.","h_score":1706767.7125000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":27622457,"revid":1168049148,"description":"History of a peninsula on the Iberian coast","categories":["Geographic history of Spain","History of Gibraltar"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Rock of Ages: Gibraltar's Storied Past\n\nGibraltar, the iconic British Overseas Territory perched at the mouth of the Mediterranean, has been a coveted prize for empires due to its strategic location and imposing limestone rock. From ancient trade routes to modern sovereignty disputes, its history reflects a blend of cultural clashes and resilient defense that has shaped global geopolitics for centuries.\n\n#### Ancient Roots and Early Struggles\nGibraltar's history begins with prehistoric settlers, evolving into a key waypoint for Phoenicians, Carthaginians, and Romans who recognized its commanding views over vital sea lanes. The Moors captured it in 711 AD, fortifying what would become a symbol of Mediterranean power, before it changed hands in the Reconquista. As historian Simon Winchester once noted, \"Gibraltar stands as a sentinel of the ancient world, where winds of conquest have whispered through the ages.\"\n\n#### British Acquisition and Imperial Conflicts\nIn 1704, during the War of Spanish Succession, Anglo-Dutch forces seized Gibraltar, leading to its formal cession to Britain under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. This sparked centuries of sieges, including the Great Siege of 1779-1783, where its defenses held firm against Spanish and French assaults, underscoring its role in Britain's global empire. Winston Churchill, reflecting on its importance, declared, \"Gibraltar is not just a rock; it is the key to the Western Mediterranean.\"\n\n#### Modern Gibraltar: Identity and Disputes\nIn the 20th century, Gibraltar evolved into a self-governing territory with a unique blend of British and Mediterranean culture, though sovereignty claims by Spain have persisted, notably during the 1960s border closures. Referendums in 1967 and 2002 affirmed overwhelming local support for British status, amidst EU negotiations and Brexit fallout. As the territory navigates these tensions, its economy thrives on tourism and finance, embodying a resilient spirit amid changing alliances.\n\nLooking ahead, Gibraltar's strategic role may intensify with rising global trade tensions, potentially reshaping its future in an interconnected world."}

Her first national level victory was also in 1992 at the Milo-Dunlop Sport National Junior Interstate Championship, where she won silver in the Under-16 category. In 1994, David was chosen to join the Penang state squash team for the Malaysian Games (SUKMA) tournament where she helped Penang win a gold medal in the team event, despite being ill at the time.

It is 335 metres (1,099 ft) long, running adjacent the Royal Albert Bridge, and part of the A38, a main road between the two counties.\n\nDuring the 20th century, there was increasing demand to replace or supplement the Saltash and Torpoint ferries, which could not cope with the rise in motor traffic. The Government refused to prioritise the project, so it was financed by Plymouth City Council and Cornwall County Council. Construction was undertaken by the Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company and began in 1959. It was unofficially opened in October 1961, with a formal presentation by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in April 1962. A reconstruction of the bridge began in 1999 after it was found to be unable to support a European Union requirement for goods vehicle weights. The work involved building two new parallel decks while the original construction was completely rebuilt. The project was completed in late 2001 and formally opened by Princess Anne in April 2002. The extra decks have remained in use, increasing the bridge's capacity.\n\nThe bridge is tolled for eastbound travel, with a discount available via an electronic payment scheme. It has become a significant landmark in Plymouth, Saltash and the surrounding area, and used on several occasions for protests or to highlight the work of charities and fundraisers.\n\n ## Location\n\nThe bridge runs over the River Tamar from near Wearde, Saltash in the west to Riverside, Plymouth in the east. It has a central span of 335 metres (1,099 ft) and two side spans of 114 metres (374 ft). It is part of the A38, a major cross-country road that runs across Cornwall and Devon, and lies immediately north of the Royal Albert Bridge, a significant railway bridge designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel that opened in 1859. Both bridges are north of the Hamoaze, the estuary that the Tamar feeds into, and the Torpoint Ferry.\n\nThe bridge is owned and maintained by the Tamar Bridge and Torpoint Ferry Joint Committee, a conglomerate between Plymouth City Council and Cornwall County Council. It has a main span of three lanes, which use a tidal flow arrangement to maximise traffic flow at rush hour, and two outer lanes. The north of these is used as a local access route from Saltash, while the south is used by cyclists and pedestrians but could be converted to meet future vehicle demand if alternatives for pedestrians and bicycles were provided, a dedicated ferry, shuttle bus, cable car or bridge have been considered.\n\n ### Tolls\n\nThe current tolls are \u00a32.60 for cars, and \u00a36.30, \u00a310.40 and \u00a314.30 for 2, 3 and 4-axle goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes respectively. An electronic device called the Tamar Tag can be affixed to a vehicle window, which allows the driver to travel at half-fare. Tolls are only payable when travelling eastbound from Saltash to Plymouth.\n\nThere is no charge for pedestrians, cyclists and motorcycles. Disabled drivers can apply for concessions online or via an office next to the Torpoint Ferry.\n\n ## Construction\n\n ### Requirement\n\nFor centuries, road users wishing to go from Saltash to Plymouth had two main options. Travel by coach involved a long detour north either to Gunnislake New Bridge (a one-lane bridge constructed in 1520), or other bridges further north along the Devon \u2013 Cornwall border. The alternative was to catch a ferry across the Tamar. The Torpoint Ferry had been running successfully since 1791 (and is still in active service) while the Saltash Ferry ran near to the bridge's present location. While popular, the ferries did not have sufficient capacity by the 20th century to cater for motor traffic. The idea for a fixed crossing across the Tamar had been floated around since the early 19th century, and proposals had been discussed in Parliament as early as 1930.\n\nIn 1950, Cornwall County Council and Plymouth City Council discussed the feasibility of building a road bridge. The government was unenthusiastic about the idea, as they did not believe it was financially viable and there were more urgent projects in post-war Britain. After being rebuked, both councils agreed to self-fund the entire project, which would be paid for in tolls. The scheme received Royal Assent in July 1957. Invitations to tender were sent on 4 March 1959, and a proposal from the northeast England-based Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company was accepted on 9 June.\n\n ### Building\n\nPreparatory work on the bridge started in July 1959. The bridge was built using suspended construction, which involved building two 67 metres (220 ft) concrete towers with support cables over these. Hangers were attached to these cables and the road deck was transported by barge and lifted into place. Cleveland Bridge and Engineering later used the same technique to construct the first Severn Bridge.\n\nThe central span of the bridge was 1,848 feet (563 m). The support cables were both 2,200 feet (670 m) long, with a combined weight of 850 tons. They were constructed for Cleveland Bridge and Engineering by British Ropes Ltd. The deck was made out of a concrete base covered with 20-millimetre (0.79 in) steel plates approx and 200-millimetre (7.9 in) of standard road tarmac. The roadway catered for three lanes of traffic and was designed to be 33 feet (10 m) wide, with an additional 6 feet (1.8 m) for pedestrians either side of the bridge. It could support an estimated capacity of 20,000 vehicles a day, with a maximum individual vehicle weight of 38 tons. Bridge materials had a similar colour to the Royal Albert Bridge, which it runs parallel to.\n\nThe bridge was unofficially opened at 6am on 24 October 1961, when the construction barriers were removed. It was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother on 26 April 1962.\n\nThe total cost of the bridge was \u00a31.8 million (now \u00a3 million). It was the first major suspension bridge to be constructed in the UK after World War II, and the longest suspension bridge in Britain.\n\n ### Operation\n\nThe initial toll for cars was 3s (15p) for a single journey across the bridge, or 4\/6 (221\u20442p) for a return, while for lorries it was 14s (70p) and \u00a31 respectively. The Saltash Ferry closed, but the Torpoint Ferry remained in operation; management of the ferry and the bridge is shared so the two crossings are not in direct competition with each other.\n\nBy 1979, the toll had risen to 30p for a single car journey. It had risen again to \u00a31 by 1995, which remained in place until 2010, when they were increased to \u00a31.50. On 19 November 2019 the new standard toll was set at \u00a32.00.\n\nIn 1961, approximately 4000 vehicles used the Tamar Bridge each day. This significantly increased in the following decades; in 1998 the hourly rate during the morning rush hour was 2500 vehicles. The average weekday saw 38,200 vehicles cross the bridge and the summer weekday flow was 42,900.

Established in 1886, the park encompasses 1,349 km<sup>2<\/sup> (521 sq mi), and includes a portion of the Selkirk Mountains which are part of the larger grouping of mountains, the Columbia Mountains. It also contains the Rogers Pass National Historic Site.\n\nThe park's history is closely tied to two primary Canadian transportation routes, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), completed in 1885, and the Trans-Canada Highway, completed in 1963. Rogers Pass in the centre of the park eluded explorers until 1881. The railway brought with it tourism, the establishment of Glacier National Park and the construction of a popular alpine hotel. The heavy winter snows and steep, avalanche-prone valleys of the park have been a major obstacle to transportation, necessitating much railway engineering and avalanche control measures.\n\nThe park contains high peaks, large, active glaciers, and one of Canada's largest cave systems. Its dense forests support populations of large mammals, birds, and alpine species. The region is noted for its heavy snowfall. The park has an extensive network of trails, three campgrounds, and four backcountry huts and cabins. Due to the major transportation routes that bisect it, Glacier National Park sees large numbers of visitors.\n\n ## History\n\nThe Selkirk Mountains were first noted by Europeans when explorer David Thompson of the North West Company skirted around them on the Columbia River in 1811. He named them Nelson's Mountains, after Lord Horatio Nelson, but they were later renamed after an executive for the rival Hudson's Bay Company, Lord Thomas Douglas Selkirk.\n\nFinding a pass through the Selkirks became a priority after construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway began. Completion of the railway was a condition of the Colony of British Columbia upon entering Canadian Confederation in 1867. In 1865, Canadian Pacific Surveyor Walter Moberly led an expedition up the Illecillewaet River (which he named, using the Okanangan word for \"swift water\"). Despite recently discovering Eagle Pass through the nearby Monashees, Moberly failed to find a pass through the Selkirks after getting sidetracked in the Tangier Creek drainage. His party refused to explore further due to the lateness of the season, and Moberly was forced to retreat.\n\n ### Rogers Pass\n\nAn expedition led by Major Albert Bowman Rogers up the Illecillewaet discovered a viable pass in 1881. Rogers was awarded a five thousand dollar prize for locating a route through the mountains. In 1885, the CPR constructed a line through Rogers Pass and the following year trains were travelling west to the Pacific for the first time in Canada. The federal government and the CPR quickly realized the tourism potential of the mountainous, heavily glaciated area. Following a trip by Prime Minister John A. Macdonald and his wife Agnes through the Rockies on the newly completed Trancontinental Railroad, he returned to Ottawa inspired, and led the creation of Glacier and Yoho National Parks, both established on October 10, 1886. They were the second and third national parks in the country, after Banff, a year earlier.\n\n ### Glacier House\n\nThe grade of the railway approaching Rogers Pass was too steep to allow for dining cars on the trains, so the CPR built a hotel west of the pass in 1886. This added to a collection of CPR-owned hotels across Canada, including Mount Stephen House in Yoho National Park, built in the same year and with the same floor plan. Glacier House, located near the terminus of the Illecillewaet Glacier (called the Great Glacier at the time), became a centre for tourism, mountaineering, glaciology, and photography in the Selkirks. The hotel was expanded in 1905 and 1911. It was considered one of western Canada's premier tourist destinations at the turn of the twentieth century.\n\nThe hotel attracted alpinists from around the world. Owing to its elevation, climbers could be in the high alpine within hours of leaving their room. In 1899, the CPR contracted the services of several Swiss guides to assist the less mountain-savvy tourists through the high country. Throughout the Glacier House period, many first ascents were made on peaks within the park. The hotel also attracted naturalists and scientists keen to study the mountain environment. Mary Vaux Walcott and her brothers, George and William Vaux, visited the area many times, and began the first scientific studies of the Illecillewaet Glacier.\n\n ### Mountaineering\n\nGlacier House is considered \"the first center (sic) of alpinism\" in North America by American Alpine Club historian William Lowell Putnam. It saw an influx of European and American professional climbers in its first two decades of operation. William Spotswood Green was the first European climber to make note of the excellent climbing possibilities of peaks near the CPR line. Green and Henry Swanzy made the first recorded ascents of major peaks in the summer of 1888, climbing Mount Bonney and Green's Peak. Harold Topham, a British climber, made many first ascents in 1890 including Mount Fox; he later joined with Henry Forster, and two Swiss climbers, Emil Huber and Carl Sulzer to explore the southern peaks of the park. Huber and Sulzer also claimed the prized first ascent of the dramatic Mount Sir Donald.\n\nArthur Oliver Wheeler, a cartographer, climber, and founding member of the Alpine Club of Canada (ACC), came to Glacier House in 1901. This started a thirty-year relationship with the northern Selkirks, which saw Wheeler map the region, publish large reference works on its geography, and explore much of the park's terrain. An ACC hut near the Illecillewaet campground bears his name, as well as a peak and a pass. Professor Charles Ernest Fay, first president of the American Alpine Club, after visiting the park in the 1890s, publicized it in the club's magazine. By the 1900s, almost all of the park's prominent peaks had seen human tracks.\n\n ### Connaught Tunnel and the Trans-Canada Highway\n\nAfter its first winter in operation in 1886, it became clear to the CPR that the heavy snows of Rogers Pass were going to be a serious challenge. Extensive snow sheds were built to shelter the rails from frequent avalanches. These wood sheds became a fire hazard in the summer months, so a separate summer track was built. In 1910, while clearing one slide, another avalanche came down Avalanche Mountain, killing 62 men. More than half the workers killed in the slide were of Japanese descent. In all, two hundred railway employees were killed between 1886 and 1916. In 1912, the CPR admitted defeat and started the construction of an eight-kilometre tunnel under the pass and Mount Macdonald. The Connaught Tunnel opened in 1916.\n\nThe new tunnel bypassed Glacier House's siding, and the resulting lack of rail passengers spelled the end for the once-popular hotel. It was closed in 1925, and torn down four years later. The park saw few visitors besides campers from the Alpine Club of Canada's summer camps for the next thirty years. Until this point, automobile travellers crossing the Columbia Mountains had to use the circuitous Big Bend Highway, which followed the upper reaches of the Columbia River north in a large loop. With the planned inundation of much of that valley by hydro projects outlined in the Columbia River Treaty, a new highway route was needed. In 1963, the Trans-Canada Highway was built through Rogers Pass, bringing tourists back to the park in large numbers. Parks Canada built several new campgrounds and expanded the trail system.\n\n ## Geography\n\nThe park covers the northern part of the Selkirk Mountains, a sub-range of the Columbia Mountains. It contains numerous glaciers and large, swift waterways. The park is bisected by two major transportation routes, the Trans-Canada Highway and the Canadian Pacific Railway. The nearest towns are Revelstoke to the west, and Golden to the east.\n\n ### Mountains\n\nThe Columbia Mountains rise from the plateaus of the Central Interior and extend eastward to the Rocky Mountain Trench. Geologically distinct from the nearby Rockies, the range is divided into four sub-ranges: the Cariboos, Monashees, Selkirks, and the Purcells. Glacier encompasses a portion of the northern Selkirks and a narrow strip of the northern Purcells. The topography of the park varies between rounded mountains and ridges in the east, north, and west, and sharp, steep-sided peaks in the central and southern regions. A.O. Wheeler measured many of the park's mountains in 1901 and 1902 using a complex system of fixed points and photographs. In the early 20th century, the area was referred to as the \"Canadian Alps\". Most names are from historical figures, including explorers, surveyors, mountaineers, and railway and Hudson's Bay Company executives.\n\n #### Major peaks and ranges\n\nThe highest point in the park is Mount Dawson, at 3,377 metres (11,079 ft). The precipitous Mount Sir Donald stands at 3,284 metres (10,774 ft), Mount Macdonald at 2,883 metres (9,459 ft), Mount McNicoll at 2,610 metres (8,560 ft), and Mount Abbott at 2,465 metres (8,087 ft). Peaks of the Hermit Range, the Bonney and Bostock Groups, the Van Horne Range, Purity Range and the Dawson Range, all lie wholly or in part within the park, including Uto Peak at 2,927 metres (9,603 ft) in the Sir Donald Range.\n\n","h_score":1840887.0562500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1415629,"revid":1159339352,"description":"Canadian national park located in British Columbia","categories":["Columbia Country","Glacier National Park (Canada)","National parks in British Columbia","Parks in British Columbia","Protected areas established in 1886","Selkirk Mountains"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's the scoop on Glacier National Park in Canada?  \nA1: Picture a rugged wilderness where ancient glaciers sculpt the landscape like frozen artists at work\u2014Glacier National Park is a vast protected area in British Columbia, spanning over 1,349 square miles of towering peaks and pristine valleys.

The expressway is formed from the median lanes of the HEFT, and immediately turns to the northeast, passing under the HEFT's northbound lanes. Southbound HEFT traffic cannot access northbound SR 874; likewise, southbound SR 874 traffic cannot access the HEFT northbound. After turning to the northeast and entering Kendall, the six-laned Don Shula Expressway subsequently parallels CSX's Homestead Subdivision past predominantly residential neighborhoods for its entire route. SR 874 meets its first of three toll gantries about 1.4 miles (2.3 km) north of its southern terminus, just north of its former lone toll plaza.\n\nAbout two miles (3.2 km) from SR 874's southern terminus, the expressway interchanges with Killian Parkway (SR 990) and Southwest 107th Avenue (SR 985) at a partial cloverleaf interchange. The Don Shula Expressway continues on for 1.1 miles (1.8 km), passing through another toll gantry, before reaching an interchange with Kendall Drive (SR 94). Almost immediately afterwards, SR 874 crosses the Snapper Creek Canal and enters the Sunset district. It then reaches the partial interchange with the Snapper Creek Expressway (SR 878); indeed, southbound motorists along the Don Shula Expressway who wish to exit to Kendall Drive are directed onto the westernmost portion of SR 878. Once past the Snapper Creek Expressway, SR 874 features no interchanges for the remainder of its route. Just north of the bridge over Sunset Drive (SR 986), about one-half mile (800 m) north of SR 878, motorists in both directions are provided with a separated lane to take their vehicles to if caught in an accident. One-quarter mile (400 m) past the accident investigation sites, the Don Shula Expressway swings north over the railroad, crossing over Galloway Road (SR 973) in the process, and resumes its northeasterly orientation, now forming the boundary between the communities of Olympia Heights, to the road's north, and Glenvar Heights, to the south. 0.6 miles (970 m) later, SR 874 passes through its third and final toll gantry, before reaching its northern terminus in a partial interchange with the Palmetto Expressway after another one mile (1.6 km). Like at its southern terminus, SR 874 forms the central lanes of SR 826 northbound; however, its interchange is integrated with SR 826's interchange with Bird Road (SR 976). Also like its southern terminus, there is no access for northbound SR 874 or SR 826 traffic to the other route's southbound counterpart.\n\n ## Tolls\n\nSR 874's tolls are entirely electronic: cash cannot be accepted along its length. Payment is done either via SunPass transponders or via toll-by-plate billing, the latter of which attracts a higher cost. Three toll gantries are located along the Don Shula Expressway: the first between the HEFT and Killian Parkway, the second between Killian Parkway and Kendall Drive, and the last between the Snapper Creek and Palmetto Expressways. The relationship between the tolling points and interchanges along SR 874 and SR 878 is that all motorists are charged at least one toll for using the road; there are no \"free sections\". As of July 1, 2013, the cost for a two-axled vehicle to drive the entire length of SR 874 is \\$1.00 with a SunPass transponder, or \\$2.00 via the toll-by-plate program, with the two southern gantries charging \\$0.25 (SunPass) or \\$0.50 (toll-by-plate) each, and the northern one charging twice as much. Each additional axle on a vehicle attracts a surcharge equal to the cost of a two-axled vehicle for each gantry passed.\n\n","h_score":1769738.3187500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":2556042,"revid":1162350386,"description":"Highway in Florida","categories":["Freeways in the United States","State Roads in Miami-Dade County, Florida","State highways in Florida","Toll roads in Florida"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Florida's Ribbon of Rush: Decoding State Road 874\n\nIn the sun-soaked sprawl of Miami-Dade County, State Road 874 stands as a sleek toll road artery, whisking drivers from the urban jungle to suburban havens with promises of speed and efficiency. Yet, beneath its concrete veins lie tales of traffic woes and ambitious expansions, making it a pivotal player in Florida's ever-evolving transportation saga.\n\n**A Highway's Humble Origins**  \nState Road 874, also known as the Don Shula Expressway, burst onto the scene in the 1980s as a bold fix for Miami's growing gridlock, slicing through wetlands and neighborhoods to connect the Palmetto Expressway to the Homestead Extension. This 7-mile stretch of elevated roadway was designed with modern commuters in mind, featuring high-speed lanes and electronic tolling that painted it as a futuristic escape from Florida's notorious crawls. \"It's like a silver bullet through the Everglades' edge,\" remarked historian Maria Gonzalez, capturing the road's innovative spirit amid the state's boom years.\n\n**The Pulse of Daily Commutes**  \nFor thousands of Floridians, SR 874 is a daily dance of acceleration and frustration, where palm trees blur by and toll booths demand their digital tribute. This expressway hums with a mix of soccer moms, delivery trucks, and snowbirds, its lanes weaving a vivid tapestry of Miami's multicultural rush hour. As one local put it, \"SR 874 turns a 45-minute nightmare into a breezy 15 minutes\u2014if you're lucky,\" shared commuter Alex Rivera, highlighting the road's unpredictable charm.\n\n**Navigating Challenges and Curves**  \nDespite its allure, SR 874 grapples with aging infrastructure, frequent accidents, and environmental concerns from nearby ecosystems, drawing scrutiny from officials and activists alike. Maintenance crews battle the tropical elements, from salty sea air corrosion to hurricane-season floods, keeping the road's safety in a delicate balance. These issues underscore the broader tensions of urban growth in Florida, where progress often clashes with nature's wild whims.\n\nAs debates over widening projects intensify, State Road 874 may soon evolve into an even faster lifeline for Florida's booming population."}

The weekly passenger train having left Alice Springs the day before, railwaymen cobbled together a three-car train for MacArthur, his family, Sutherland, Morhouse and Huff to take them southwards on the decrepit railway, adding a sleeping car at a siding on the way. Two Australian sergeants were aboard to serve meals; an army nurse undertook the housekeeping. To reach the dining or sleeping car, passengers had to wait until the locomotive stopped, then get off and walk along the train. But there were many stops, and the train often had to lay over in crossing loops because opposing it on the single track were trains conveying supplies and men to the north.\n\nIt took 48 hours of traveling at no more than 20 miles per hour (32 kilometers per hour) before the party disembarked from their \"ancient conveyance\", on the morning of 20 March, at Terowie where all traffic, passengers and freight alike, had to change to broad-gauge trains.\n\nHaving thought his whereabouts would have been secret, MacArthur was alarmed to find crowds, a military guard of honor and reporters waiting for his 9 am arrival. The reporters' expectations of a briefing were unmet: he simply said that his policy during operations was to limit himself completely to the briefest publicity and to confine such statements to general releases from his headquarters. He followed briefly with the reason he was in Australia and concluded with a catchphrase that both alluded to his perilous journey and embodied his single-minded focus on liberating the Philippines that became widely publicized during the next three years: \"I came through and I shall return\".\n\nThe new train for the 150 miles (240 km) journey to Adelaide through a cooler, grassy region of South Australia was more commodious and, as a special movement, much faster. Comfort was incomparably better, since the South Australian Railways Commissioner had included his personal carriage, normally used for inspections, in the train hurriedly prepared for the party. Somewhat refreshed but still greatly fatigued, the family arrived in Adelaide in the early afternoon, to be met on the platform at the Adelaide railway station by senior U.S. and Australian army officers, diplomats and local dignitaries. The carriages, including the Commissioner's carriage at the back, departed for Melbourne at 7 pm attached to The Overland express.\n\nAt 9 am on 21 March, MacArthur's journey ended when his train arrived at Melbourne's Spencer Street station, where he was greeted by the Australian Minister for the Army, Frank Forde.\n\n","h_score":1796395.2750000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":36034784,"revid":1166263008,"description":"World War II escape","categories":["1942 in the Philippines","Douglas MacArthur","March 1942 events","Military history of the Philippines during World War II","PT boats","Voyages"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### MacArthur's Daring Escape from the Philippines\n\nIn early 1942, General Douglas MacArthur evacuated the Philippines amid a rapid Japanese advance, following orders from U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt to continue the fight from elsewhere. His successful departure by PT boat to Australia not only preserved key military leadership but also boosted Allied morale during a dark period of World War II.\n\n#### The Context of the War\nBy March 1942, Japanese forces had overwhelmed U.S. and Filipino troops in the Philippines, forcing a strategic retreat. MacArthur, as commander of U.S. Army Forces in the Far East, had been defending the islands since the attack on Pearl Harbor, but dwindling resources and overwhelming enemy numbers made holding ground untenable. This situation prompted urgent directives from Washington to relocate MacArthur to maintain effective command.\n\n#### The Escape Details\nMacArthur and his family left Corregidor Island on March 11, 1942, traveling by patrol torpedo boat to Mindanao and then flying to Australia. The operation was secretive and risky, involving coordination with local forces to evade Japanese patrols. \"I shall return,\" MacArthur declared upon his arrival in Australia, as reported in his official statements, encapsulating his determination to reclaim the Philippines.\n\n#### Aftermath and Significance\nThe escape allowed MacArthur to lead Allied counteroffensives in the Pacific, culminating in his return to the Philippines in 1944. \"The President of the United States ordered me to break through the Japanese lines,\" MacArthur later explained in his memoirs, highlighting the direct command that saved his life and altered the war's course. His actions reinforced U.S. commitment to the region, influencing future military strategies.\n\nThis event remains a cornerstone of World War II history, illustrating the importance of adaptive leadership in global conflicts."}

In the sequence with the death of Ellie's father, they planned to use an effect similar to bullet time from The Matrix to show him stopped in time as he died. As the movie was filmed, they found the approach didn't fit the casting or the direction the film was going. They decided it would be most effective to create something distressing but with Ellie's dad absent from the shot, leading to the development of the mirror sequence. The decoding of the extraterrestrial message, with its architectural drawings of the machine, was created by Ken Ralston and Sony Pictures Imageworks. It was Zemeckis's and Ralston's sixth film collaboration. Imageworks created more than 350 visual effect shots, using a combination of model and miniature shots and digital graphics. On designing the Machine, Zemeckis said, \"The Machine in Sagan's novel was somewhat vague, which is fine for a book. In a movie, though, if you're going to build a giant physical structure of alien design, you have to make it believable... It had to be huge, so that the audience would feel like it was bigger than man should be tinkering with. It had to look absolutely real.\" The machine was then designed by concept artist Steve Burg, reusing a design he created as a \"time-displacement device\" for an unused scene in Terminator 2. Early conceptual designs of the Pod were based, as in the novel, on one of the primary shapes in geometry: a dodecahedron, or a twelve-sided body. Eventually it was modified to a spherical capsule that encased the traveler, with a dodecahedron surrounding the sphere. Zemeckis and the production crew also made several visits to the Kennedy Space Center at Merritt Island adjacent to Cape Canaveral, where officials gave them access to sites off-limits to most visitors. Filmmakers were also brought onto Launch Complex 39 before the launch of the Space Shuttle, where they studied the mechanics of the elevator, gantry area and loading arm for the design of the Machine's surrounding supports and gantry. Once the concept met with the filmmakers' approval, physical construction began on the sets for the Pod, elevator interior and gantry, which took almost four months. The rest of the effects were compiled digitally by Imageworks. The climactic scene depicting the mysterious beach near the galactic core where Arroway makes contact, in particular, called for major visual innovations. The goal was an idyllic seashore with a sky blazing with stars that might exist near the core of the galaxy. Ralston said that \"the thought was that this beach would have a heightened reality. One that might make the everyday world seem like a vague daydream.\" To keep the question alive whether any of it was real in Arroway's mind, elements such as ocean waves running in reverse and palm tree shadows swaying with sped-up motion were applied. The Hitler newsreel also required digital manipulation. ### Music\n\nThe original score was composed by Alan Silvestri, most of which was released on August 19, 1997, by Warner Bros. Records.

The film masterfully blends cutting-edge science with profound philosophical debates, captivating audiences with its exploration of belief versus evidence.\n\n**The Plot That Ignites Wonder**  \nAt its core, 'Contact' follows Dr. Ellie Arroway's relentless pursuit of extraterrestrial life, turning a mysterious radio signal into a gateway for first contact. With vivid imagery of vast cosmic vistas and the hum of machinery against starry backdrops, the story thrusts viewers into a whirlwind of discovery, ethical dilemmas, and personal transformation, all while painting the universe as a tantalizing puzzle waiting to be solved.\n\n**The Stellar Cast and Creative Sparks**  \nRobert Zemeckis assembled a powerhouse team, including Foster's riveting performance and contributions from Carl Sagan, whose novel inspired the script. \"The cosmos is within us; we're made of star-stuff,\" Sagan once mused, highlighting the film's blend of awe and intellect.

Alweo's father was Eowa, who may have shared the throne for some time with his brother, Penda. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle does not mention Eowa; though it does date Penda's reign as the thirty years from 626 to 656, when Penda was killed at the battle of the Winwaed. Two later sources also name Eowa as king: the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae. The Annales Cambriae is the source for Eowa's death in 644 at the battle of Maserfield, where Penda defeated Oswald of Northumbria. Details on Penda's reign are scarce, and it is a matter for speculation whether Eowa was an underking, owing allegiance to Penda, or if instead Eowa and Penda had divided Mercia between them. If they did divide the kingdom, it is likely that Eowa ruled northern Mercia, as Penda's son Peada was established later as the king of southern Mercia by the Northumbrian Oswiu, who defeated the Mercians and killed Penda in 656. It is possible that Eowa fought against Penda at Maserfield. During \u00c6thelbald's youth, Penda's dynasty ruled Mercia; Ceolred, a grandson of Penda and therefore a second cousin of \u00c6thelbald, was king of Mercia from 709 to 716. An early source, Felix's Life of Saint Guthlac, reveals that it was Ceolred who drove \u00c6thelbald into exile. Guthlac was a Mercian nobleman who abandoned a career of violence to become first a monk at Repton Abbey, and later a hermit living in a barrow at Crowland, in the East Anglian fens. During \u00c6thelbald's exile he and his men also took refuge in the Fens in the area, and visited Guthlac. Guthlac was sympathetic to \u00c6thelbald's cause, perhaps because of Ceolred's oppression of the monasteries. Other visitors of Guthlac's included Bishop Haedde of Lichfield, an influential Mercian, and it may be that Guthlac's support was politically useful to \u00c6thelbald in gaining the throne. After Guthlac's death, \u00c6thelbald had a dream in which Guthlac prophesied greatness for him, and \u00c6thelbald later rewarded Guthlac with a shrine when he had become king. When Ceolred died of a fit at a banquet, \u00c6thelbald returned to Mercia and became ruler. It is possible that a king named Ceolwald, perhaps a brother of Ceolred, reigned for a short while between Ceolred and \u00c6thelbald. \u00c6thelbald's accession ended Penda's line of descent; \u00c6thelbald's reign was followed, after a brief interval, by that of Offa, another descendant of Eowa. Other than his father, Alweo, little of \u00c6thelbald's immediate family is known, although in the witness list of two charters a leading ealdorman named Heardberht is recorded as his brother.","h_score":1812004.58125,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":84137,"revid":1161235940,"description":"8th-century King of Mercia","categories":["757 deaths","8th-century English monarchs","Anglo-Saxon warriors","Burials at St. Wystan's Church, Repton","House of Icel","Mercian monarchs","Year of birth unknown"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"# \u00c6thelbald: The Shadow Ruler Who Forged a Saxon Empire\n\nIn the misty annals of 8th-century England, \u00c6thelbald of Mercia rose from relative obscurity to become a formidable king, expanding his realm through cunning warfare and shrewd diplomacy. His reign, a whirlwind of conquests and church skirmishes, not only dominated the Anglo-Saxon landscape but also sparked debates that echo in today's power plays.\n\n### Rise from the Shadows\nAmid the fog-shrouded hills of ancient Mercia, \u00c6thelbald emerged as a warrior-prince in the early 700s, seizing the throne amid familial intrigue and Viking threats. With a flair for dramatic alliances, he welded disparate tribes into a formidable force, his campaigns painting the countryside with the bold strokes of ambition and blood-soaked banners.\n\n### Conquests and Clashes\n\u00c6thelbald's rule exploded into a tapestry of victories, from subduing rivals in Kent to challenging the mighty church, all while navigating the treacherous currents of medieval politics. \"He was a whirlwind of iron and strategy,\" noted the historian Bede in his chronicles, capturing the king's unyielding drive. Yet, his overreaches, like meddling in ecclesiastical affairs, sowed seeds of resentment among allies.\n\n### Legacy in the Mists of Time\nThough his 41-year reign ended in assassination in 757, \u00c6thelbald's influence lingered as a blueprint for future English monarchs, blending martial glory with administrative innovation. \"His era brought a golden haze of growth, but at what cost?\" pondered the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, highlighting the dual edges of his legacy.

Another son of al-Mustansir had been born in 1060 with the same name\u2014Abu'l-Qasim Ahmad\u2014as the future al-Musta'li, and some later sources have confused this as al-Musta'li's birth date. It is assumed by modern scholars that this older brother had died in the meantime, allowing the name to be reused for al-Musta'li. In one source he is called Abu'l-Qasim Ahmad 'the Younger' (or possibly 'the Youngest', i.e. of all sons).\n\nAt the time of his birth, the Fatimid Caliphate, established in Egypt with Cairo as its capital since 973, was undergoing a profound crisis: it had lost most of Syria to the Seljuk Turks, while in Egypt itself, clashes between the Fatimid army's Turkish and black African troops led to the breakdown of the central government and widespread famine and anarchy, leaving al-Mustansir as a powerless figurehead, virtually imprisoned in his palace and at the mercy of military warlords. In January 1074, the general Badr al-Jamali assumed the vizierate and proceeded to restore peace and order in the country and repel a Seljuk invasion, saving al-Mustansir's life and his dynasty; but at the cost of al-Mustansir delegating all his powers over the government, army, and the religious and judicial administration to him.\n\n","h_score":1774649.0437500002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":2193582,"revid":1173738369,"description":"Fatimid caliph and imam (1074\u20131101)","categories":["1074 births","1101 deaths","11th-century Fatimid caliphs","12th-century Fatimid caliphs","Egyptian Ismailis","Muslims of the First Crusade","Musta'li imams","Sons of Fatimid caliphs","Year of birth uncertain"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Al-Musta'li, and why should we care about him today?  \nA1: Al-Musta'li was the ninth caliph of the Fatimid dynasty, ruling Egypt from 1094 to 1101, like a shadowy chess piece in the grand game of medieval Islamic history. He inherited a throne amid turmoil, becoming a pivotal figure in Shia Islam's Ismaili branch. His legacy lingers in modern religious debates, reminding us how ancient power plays still echo in today's cultural tapestries.\n\nQ2: When and where did Al-Musta'li live, and what was his world like?  \nA2: Born around 1074 in Cairo, Egypt, Al-Musta'li reigned during a vibrant yet volatile era of Fatimid rule, with bustling markets and clashing empires. Imagine a Cairo alive with scholars, spies, and silk traders, where alliances shifted like desert sands under the weight of Crusader threats and internal rivalries. This backdrop shaped his brief but intense leadership.\n\nQ3: What was Al-Musta'li's role in the Fatimid dynasty?  \nA3: As caliph, he served as both spiritual leader and political ruler, upholding the Fatimid claim to divine authority in a dynasty known for its intellectual flair. He navigated court intrigues with a mix of diplomacy and force, much like a captain steering a ship through stormy seas. His reign focused on maintaining unity amid growing sectarian tensions.\n\nQ4: How did Al-Musta'li come to power, and was it smooth?  \nA4: Al-Musta'li ascended the throne at age 20 after his father, al-Mustansir, died in 1094, but the transition was far from seamless\u2014rife with plots and family disputes. Picture a young ruler thrust into a whirlwind of betrayal, where his elder brother Nizar's rival claim sparked a schism that fractured the Ismaili community. This power grab set the stage for lasting divisions.\n\nQ5: What religious significance does Al-Musta'li hold in Ismaili Islam?  \nA5: He became the eponym for the Musta'li branch of Ismailism, emphasizing a more conservative interpretation of Shia doctrine, as if he were a key locking away older traditions. His recognition as the rightful imam by some followers contrasted with others who backed Nizar, creating a rift that persists in sects like the Dawoodi Bohras. This twist adds a layer of mystical intrigue to his story.\n\nQ6: Were there major events or conflicts during Al-Musta'li's reign?  \nA6: His rule saw external pressures from the Crusades and internal rebellions, painting him as a defender of Fatimid territories against encroaching forces. One key event was the consolidation of alliances with Sunni powers, a bold maneuver that blended pragmatism with peril. Yet, these struggles highlighted his era's fragility, like a fragile mosaic underfoot.\n\nQ7: How did Al-Musta'li's decisions influence later Islamic history?  \nA7: By endorsing a specific line of imamate succession, he inadvertently fueled the split between Musta'li and Nizari Ismailis, reshaping Shia Islam's landscape like a river carving new paths. This decision echoed in centuries of theological debates and community identities, influencing modern-day practices in places like India and Yemen. His choices remind us how one leader's moves can ripple through time.\n\nQ8: What unexpected angles make Al-Musta'li a fascinating historical figure?  \nA8: Beyond politics, Al-Musta'li's story offers a playful lens on how personal loyalties and cultural symbols, like his coinage and poetry, wove into everyday life, turning him into a symbol of resilience. Consider the irony: a ruler whose short reign sparked enduring sects, yet left few personal artifacts, making him a enigmatic puzzle for historians. This blend of mystery and impact keeps his narrative vividly alive today."}

They were known as the Forty Shilling Freeholders. The franchise for borough seats varied enormously. Originally in Peterborough the dean and chapter had claimed the franchise and held that only residents of Minster Precincts were burgesses. By the interregnum, the city was one of 37 boroughs in which suffrage was restricted to those paying scot and lot, a form of municipal taxation. In 1800 there were 2,000 registered voters in Northamptonshire and 400 in Peterborough. By 1835 this was 576, or about one per cent of the population. Bribery was general until the introduction of the secret ballot under the Ballot Act 1872. Votes were cast by spoken declaration, in public, at the hustings, erected on the Market Place (now Cathedral Square).\n\nIn 1832 the Great Reform Act enfranchised those who owned or leased land worth \u00a310 or more and the Second Reform Act extended this to all householders paying \u00a310 or more in rent per annum, effectively enfranchising the skilled working class, so by 1868 the percentage of voters in Peterborough had risen to about 20% of the population. The Third Reform Act extended the provisions of the previous act to the counties and the Fourth Reform Act widened suffrage further by abolishing practically all property qualifications for men and by enfranchising women over 30 who met minimum property qualifications. This system, known as universal manhood suffrage, was first used in the 1918 general election. However, full electoral equality would not occur until the Fifth Reform Act ten years later.\n\nAccording to the 2001 census, the population count of Peterborough constituency is 95,103 persons, comprising 46,131 males and 48,972 females. 67.56% of those aged 16\u201374 are economically active, including 5.92% unemployed; a further 12.26% are retired and 3.08% students. Of a total 39,760 households, 63.80% are owner occupied, fewer than the regional (72.71%) and national (68.72%) averages.

Copernicium was first created in 1996 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany. It was named after the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus.\n\nIn the periodic table of the elements, copernicium is a d-block transactinide element and a group 12 element.

Calculations indicate that copernicium may show the oxidation state +4, while mercury shows it in only one compound of disputed existence and zinc and cadmium do not show it at all. It has also been predicted to be more difficult to oxidize copernicium from its neutral state than the other group 12 elements. Predictions vary on whether solid copernicium would be a metal, semiconductor, or insulator. Copernicium is one of the heaviest elements whose chemical properties have been experimentally investigated.\n\n ## Introduction\n\n ## History\n\n","h_score":1767066.1312500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":67958,"revid":1172960252,"description":null,"categories":["Chemical elements","Copernicium","Nuclear physics","Synthetic elements","Transition metals"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's Copernicium, and why should I care about this mystery element?  \nA1: Copernicium is a synthetic superheavy element with atomic number 112, dreamed up in particle accelerators like a cosmic recipe gone wild. It's part of the periodic table's exclusive club of man-made marvels, symbolizing humanity's bold push into the unknown depths of chemistry. Yet, it's as elusive as a whisper in the wind, with no stable isotopes to linger long.\n\nQ2: Who gets the honor of having an element named after them?  \nA2: Copernicium pays tribute to Nicolaus Copernicus, the 16th-century astronomer who flipped our cosmic worldview by proving Earth isn't the center of the universe\u2014talk about a revolutionary namesake! This nod reflects science's playful way of honoring trailblazers, blending history with the thrill of discovery. It's like giving a star a street name in the periodic city.\n\nQ3: How did scientists cook up this element in the first place?  \nA3: Discovered in 1996 by a team at the GSI Helmholtz Centre in Germany, Copernicium was forged by smashing zinc atoms into lead targets at breakneck speeds, like alchemists with particle beams. This fusion created a fleeting atom that lasted mere milliseconds, marking a triumph of human ingenuity over nature's stubborn secrets. It's a high-stakes game of atomic billiards.\n\nQ4: What are the basic properties of Copernicium\u2014does it have any quirks?  \nA4: As a metal in the periodic table's 7th period, Copernicium is predicted to be a silvery solid with properties similar to mercury or zinc, though we've barely glimpsed it due to its ultra-short half-life of seconds. It likely conducts electricity like a reluctant wire, and its radioactivity makes it dangerously unstable, painting it as a volatile artist on the elemental canvas. These traits highlight the periodic table's wild diversity.\n\nQ5: Is Copernicium useful for anything, or is it just a lab curiosity?  \nA5: Currently, Copernicium has no practical applications due to its extreme rarity and rapid decay, serving mainly as a tool for advancing nuclear physics research. Scientists study it to test theories about superheavy elements and the island of stability, like probing a locked treasure chest for hidden gems. In the future, it might unlock insights into matter's limits, though that's still a distant dream.\n\nQ6: How does Copernicium stack up against other elements on the periodic table?  \nA6: Unlike everyday elements like gold or oxygen, Copernicium is a transactinide, placing it among the heaviest kids on the block with bizarre nuclear behaviors that defy simple patterns. It shares group traits with zinc and cadmium but amplifies them to extremes, like a rock star version of its lighter siblings. This comparison reveals the periodic table's elegant evolution, from stable stalwarts to fleeting fireworks.\n\nQ7: What makes studying Copernicium such a headache for researchers?  \nQ7: The biggest challenge is its minuscule half-life, often just fractions of a second, making it nearly impossible to observe or measure without cutting-edge detectors and accelerators. Ethical and technical hurdles, like handling hazardous radiation, add layers of complexity, turning experiments into high-wire acts. Despite this, each fleeting detection pushes the boundaries of what's possible in science.\n\nQ8: What's next for Copernicium and elements like it\u2014any exciting frontiers?  \nA8: Future research might explore the theoretical \"island of stability\" where superheavy elements like Copernicium could last longer, opening doors to new physics or even exotic materials. As tech advances, we could synthesize more of these elements to probe the universe's origins, like decoding an ancient manuscript. For now, it's a beacon for innovation, urging us to chase the intangible with playful persistence."}

It was held by a task force commanded by the Croatian soldier and diplomat Nikola Juri\u0161i\u0107. K\u0151szeg was not considered a place of importance. It was an insubstantial obstacle and many stronger places had yielded without a fight. The Grand Vizier of the Ottomans, Ibrahim Pasha, did not realize how poorly defended K\u0151szeg was. After taking a few minor places, Suleiman came to join Ibrahim Pasha shortly afterwards, when the siege had already started.\n\nThe Ottomans met stiff resistance at K\u0151szeg. Suleiman had hoped that the imperial army would come to relieve K\u0151szeg, affording him an opportunity for a larger engagement. However, during the Ottoman attacks on K\u0151szeg, the imperial army still formed up in Regensburg. The Ottomans continued with one attack after another; artillery fire brought down parts of the walls, but brought no surrender. The Ottomans' mines were sapped by countermines. The layout of K\u0151szeg's walls made mining a feasible strategy, but even though several mines succeeded in blowing holes in the fortifications, the defenders held out. For more than twenty-five days, without any artillery, Captain Nikola Juri\u0161i\u0107 and his garrison of 800 Croat soldiers held out against nineteen full-scale assaults and an incessant bombardment by the Ottomans.\n\nThere are two versions of the outcome. In the first version, Nikola Juri\u0161i\u0107 rejected the offer to surrender on favourable terms, and the Ottomans retreated. In the second version, the city was offered terms for a nominal surrender. The only Ottomans who would be allowed to enter the castle would be a token force who would raise the Ottoman flag.\n\nIn both versions, Suleiman withdrew at the arrival of the August rains, and returned homeward instead of continuing towards Vienna as previously planned. He had been delayed nearly four weeks, and during this time a powerful army had been collected in Vienna, which Suleiman did not intend to face. According to historian Paolo Giovio, Charles arrived with an imperial army at Vienna on 23 September, too late to fight the Ottomans because Suleiman had already withdrawn. By their defense of K\u0151szeg, Nikola Juri\u0161i\u0107 and his men had saved Vienna from a siege.\n\n ## Aftermath\n\nAlthough he was stopped at K\u0151szeg and failed to conquer Vienna, Suleiman additionally secured his possession in Hungary by conquering several forts, since Ferdinand and Charles evaded an open field battle. Immediately after the Ottoman withdrawal, Ferdinand reoccupied devastated territory in Austria and Hungary. Nevertheless, Suleiman concluded a peace treaty with Ferdinand in 1533, in Constantinople. The treaty confirmed the right of John Z\u00e1polya as a king of all Hungary, but recognised Ferdinand's possession of that part of the country that enjoyed the status quo. Also the Austrian archiduke was considered equal to the Ottoman Grand Vizier.\n\nThis treaty did not satisfy Z\u00e1polya or Ferdinand, whose armies began to skirmish along the borders. After Z\u00e1polya's death in 1540, Suleiman annexed Hungary to the Ottoman realm. Although from 1529 to 1566 the borders of the Ottoman Empire moved further west, none of the campaigns after 1529 achieved the decisive victory that would secure the new Ottoman possessions.","h_score":1839405.96875,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":30940778,"revid":1169074671,"description":"A siege of K\u0151szeg (German: G\u00fcns) in the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary in 1532","categories":["1532 in Europe","1532 in the Ottoman Empire","Battles involving Habsburg Croatia","Battles of the Ottoman\u2013Hungarian Wars","Conflicts in 1532","Hundred Years' Croatian\u2013Ottoman War","Sieges involving Hungary","Sieges involving the Ottoman Empire","Suleiman the Magnificent"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Unyielding Fortress: Siege of G\u00fcns Defies the Ottoman Juggernaut\n\nIn 1532, a scrappy garrison at the Hungarian fortress of G\u00fcns (now K\u00f6szeg) held off a colossal Ottoman army led by Suleiman the Magnificent, turning a minor outpost into a symbol of defiance. This epic standoff not only thwarted the invaders' advance into Europe but also galvanized the Habsburg Empire, showcasing the power of grit over sheer numbers.\n\n**The Build-Up to Battle**  \nAs Ottoman forces swept across Eastern Europe in the early 16th century, the Habsburgs braced for what seemed an inevitable clash. G\u00fcns, a modest stronghold on the frontier, became a linchpin in this tense standoff, with local commander Nikola Juri\u0161i\u0107 rallying a motley crew of soldiers and civilians against the looming threat. The stage was set for a dramatic underdog tale, where stone walls and unyielding resolve faced off against the empire's famed Janissaries and siege engines.\n\n**The Heat of the Siege**  \nFor 25 grueling days, the defenders repelled wave after wave of assaults, turning the fortress into a cauldron of smoke, arrows, and unbowed spirits. \"We will hold this ground or die upon it,\" declared Nikola Juri\u0161i\u0107, his words echoing through the battered ramparts as Ottoman cannons roared in vain. Despite being outnumbered ten to one, the garrison's clever tactics and unyielding endurance forced Suleiman to retreat, a humiliating blow to his imperial ambitions.\n\n**Legacy of the Stand**  \nThe siege's outcome shifted the balance of power, inspiring future resistances and etching G\u00fcns into the annals of military history as a testament to human tenacity. Historians often cite it as a pivotal moment in the Ottoman-Habsburg wars, with one scholar noting, \"This was no mere skirmish; it was a beacon of defiance that reshaped Europe's frontiers.\" The event's ripple effects bolstered alliances and strategies that endured for centuries.\n\nLooking ahead, the Siege of G\u00fcns reminds us that even in today's complex conflicts, a determined few can alter the tides of history with ingenuity and resolve."}

Eichelberger took two officers with him from I Corps: Byers and Colonel Frank S. Bowen, his G-3. The Eighth Army assumed control of operations on Leyte Island from Sixth Army on 26 December, the day after MacArthur and Krueger announced that organized resistance there had ended. The troops there included Eichelberger's old command, the 77th Infantry Division. In two months, Sixth Army had killed over 55,000 Japanese soldiers on Leyte, and estimated that only 5,000 remained alive on the island. By 8 May 1945, the Eighth Army had killed over 24,000 more.\n\nIn January, the Eighth Army entered combat on Luzon, landing Major General Charles P. Hall's XI Corps on 29 January near San Antonio and Major General Joseph M. Swing's 11th Airborne Division at Nasugbu, Batangas two days later. Combining with Sixth Army, the Eighth Army enveloped Manila in a great pincer movement. Eichelberger assumed personal command of the operation, which involved an advance on Manila by the lightly equipped 11th Airborne Division. The audacious advance made rapid progress until it was halted by well-prepared positions on the outskirts of Manila. MacArthur awarded Eichelberger another Silver Star.\n\nEighth Army's final operation of the war was that of clearing out the southern Philippines, including the major island of Mindanao, an effort that occupied the soldiers of the Eighth Army for the rest of the war. In six weeks, the Eighth Army conducted 14 major and 24 minor amphibious operations, clearing Mindoro, Marinduque, Panay, Negros, Cebu, and Bohol. In August 1945, Eichelberger's Eighth Army became part of the Occupation of Japan.

North Carolina Governor Luther H. Hodges responded to the incident by calling Sheriff McLeod and Pembroke Mayor J. C. Oxendine to assure them of his help if the situation required it. He then released a statement to the public, condemning the Ku Klux Klan as a violent group and stating that responsibility for the disorder \"rests squarely\" on Klan leaders. Other white observers\u2014both locally and nationally\u2014had mixed feelings about responsibility, expressing sympathy for the Lumbees' actions but suggesting that Cole's First Amendment rights may have been violated. Mayor Oxendine received telegrams, letters, and phone calls of approval from Native and non-indigenous Americans from around the United States. Alabama Governor Jim Folsom issued a statement reading, \"The white man has mistreated the Indian for 400 years. This is one time I'm glad to see and hope the Indians continue to beat the paleface.\"\n\nThe day after the failed rally, large North Carolinian newspapers such as The News and Observer and The Charlotte Observer ran stories on the clash. Most were favorable to the Lumbees and portrayed the Klansmen as antagonists. Initial reports in state and national newspapers were melodramatic and portrayed the Lumbees using stereotypes associated with Western Plains Indians. The Santa Fe New Mexican misidentified the Lumbees as part of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. The local media in Robeson County did not publish on Sundays, thus it was not until later in the week that the Scottish Chief and The Robesonian released their reporting. Their stories covered the affair and preceding events in detail and avoided the use of caricatures, treating the Lumbees as they did other community residents. On January 23 the Scottish Chief issued an editorial titled \"Setting the Record Straight,\" which criticized the national sensationalism, saying, \"all too frequently news mediums are searching for a colorful angle to a story and in doing so stretch or add to the facts.\"\n\nLocal editorials sided with the Lumbees, framing the clash as a conflict between locals and outsiders, though the editorial board of The Robesonian downplayed local discontent with segregation, proclaiming there was \"no racial rift\" between Native Americans and whites in Robeson County. Editorial pieces from around the United States ridiculed the Klan for their behavior. The Anti-Defamation League reported that the affair \"sent a ripple of laughter clear across the country.\" Reflecting on the national praise for the Lumbees' actions at Hayes Pond in contrast to the muted response to the armed black resistance to the KKK in Monroe in 1957, Robert Williams wrote, \"The national press played up the Indian-Klan fight because they didn't consider this a great threat\u2014the Indians are a tiny minority and people could laugh at the incident as a sentimental joke\u2014but no one wanted Negroes to get the impression that this was an accepted way to deal with the Klan.\"\n\n","h_score":1763525.0875000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":2644584,"revid":1169602777,"description":"1958 armed confrontation near Maxton, North Carolina, US","categories":["1958 in North Carolina","1958 riots","January 1958 events in the United States","Ku Klux Klan crimes","Ku Klux Klan in North Carolina","Lumbee","Native American history of North Carolina","Race riots in the United States","Riots and civil disorder in North Carolina","Robeson County, North Carolina"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Lumbee Tribe Clashes with KKK at Hayes Pond\n\nIn 1958, members of the Lumbee Tribe in North Carolina confronted a Ku Klux Klan rally at Hayes Pond, leading to a chaotic standoff that dispersed the white supremacists. The event highlighted Native American resistance to racial discrimination and became a pivotal moment in the civil rights movement.\n\n#### Background of the Conflict\nThe Battle of Hayes Pond stemmed from rising tensions in the Jim Crow South, where the Ku Klux Klan targeted African Americans and Native Americans through intimidation and violence. In the late 1950s, the Lumbee people, a Native American tribe in Robeson County, faced ongoing discrimination, including efforts by the KKK to suppress their communities. This confrontation was triggered by a Klan rally planned by leader James \"Catfish\" Cole, who aimed to assert white dominance in the region.\n\n#### The Events Unfold\nOn the night of January 18, 1958, approximately 50 Lumbee members arrived armed and surrounded the Klan gathering, which drew around 100 participants. The Lumbee fired shots into the air and tore down the Klan's cross, forcing the group to flee in disarray. As one Lumbee participant, Simeon Oxendine, recalled, \"We stood our ground because we were tired of being pushed around.\"\n\n#### Aftermath and Impact\nThe incident resulted in no fatalities but led to arrests on both sides, with the Klan's influence in the area diminishing significantly. It garnered national media attention, boosting support for civil rights causes. Historian David Cecelski noted, \"This event demonstrated the power of community resistance in challenging systemic racism.\" The Battle of Hayes Pond remains a celebrated act of defiance.\n\nThe legacy of this event continues to influence modern discussions on racial justice and indigenous rights."}

It was first observed in 1968 by Cameron and Angela Kepler while they were conducting observations on two Puerto Rican endemic birds, the Puerto Rican amazon and the Puerto Rican tody. On May 18, 1971, a specimen was captured in El Yunque National Forest, which at the time was believed to be its only location. A year later, Cameron Kepler and Kenneth Parkes described the species and named it Dendroica angelae, making it the most recently-discovered New World warbler. It is the first species described in the Caribbean since 1927 and the first Puerto Rican species described in the 20th century. Although the species was initially placed in the genus Dendroica, phylogenetic studies in 2010 using mitochondrial DNA sequences from New World warblers led to a revision of warbler genera. As a result, the study's authors recommended subsuming the genus Dendroica into the genus Setophaga. The same studies showed that the elfin woods warbler is most closely related to the arrowhead warbler, which is endemic to Jamaica, and the plumbeous warbler, which is endemic to the islands of Dominica and Guadeloupe. In 2011, the American Ornithologists' Union reorganized the classification of the family Parulidae and transferred species in Dendroica to Setophaga. This revised classification was subsequently adopted by the International Ornithologists' Union.\n\nThe genus name is a combination of the Ancient Greek words ses, meaning \"moth\", and phagos, meaning \"eating\". The specific name, angelae, is a tribute to Angela Kepler. Elfin-woods warbler is an alternative spelling, and Reinita de Bosque Enano is the Spanish name.\n\n ## Description\n\nThe elfin woods warbler is a small passerine, averaging 12.5 cm (5 in) in length and 8.4 g (0.30 oz) in weight. Its upperparts are predominantly black with white areas, and its underparts are white with black streaks. Other identifying characteristics are dark brown eyes, white patches on its ears and neck, an incomplete white eyering, a white eyestripe, and two white spots on its outer tail feathers. Like other Antillean warblers (Adelaide's warbler, Saint Lucia warbler, plumbeous warbler, and arrowhead warbler), it has a long bill and short, round wings (53.8 mm or 2.12 in average). Among Setophaga species, only Adelaide's warbler has a shorter average wing length. Juveniles differ from adults, retaining a grayish-green back for approximately a year and partially molting from July to October.\n\n ### Similar species\n\nThe elfin woods warbler can be confused with the black-and-white warbler, a non-breeding visitor that occurs in Puerto Rico from mid-September to early May. The main physical distinction between the two is in the face. The elfin woods warbler has an incomplete white , while the black-and-white warbler has a bold white above the eye, and the lower half of a white eye-ring. The elfin woods warbler has an entirely black while the black-and-white warbler's is bisected by a white stripe. The latter species tends to forage on larger branches, while the elfin woods warbler forages in the canopy and on smaller branch tips.\n\n ### Voice\n\nThe elfin woods warbler's song and call are difficult to hear. The species has a subtle voice and its call and song resemble those of the bananaquit, the most abundant bird in Puerto Rico. The song is a series of \"short, rapidly uttered, rather unmusical notes on one pitch, swelling in volume and terminating with a short series of distinct double syllables sounding slightly lower in pitch\" while the call has been described as \"a single, short, metallic chip\".\n\n ## Behavior\n\n ### Breeding\n\nThe elfin woods warbler breeds from March to June. Both parents are involved in the construction of the nest and in feeding the chicks. Nests are built close to the tree trunk within dry aerial leaf litter, usually Cecropia leaves (a material used by no other Parulidae species), in Bulbophyllum wadsworthii trees. Nests are well-concealed and located 1.3 to 7.6 meters (4.3 to 24.9 ft) above ground level. In 2003 a nest with four chicks was found inside a tree stump of Colorado tree, Cyrilla racemiflora, at Maricao. The nest was at about 15 feet above ground level, with little cover in a secondary forest area. Nests are cup-shaped and made from small roots and twigs, dry leaves of Chusquea abietifolia and B. wadsworthii, and dry Panicum maximum leaves. The interior is made from fibers of C. abietifolia, dry leaves and other plant matter. Females lay two or three white eggs with red-brown spots. The chick's diet consists of insects\u2014parents have been observed offering lepidopteran and orthopteran adults and lepidopteran larvae to hatchlings.\n\n ### Feeding\n\nThe elfin woods warbler is commonly found foraging the middle canopy for insects. While searching for food it often flocks with other birds, such as black-and-white warblers, Puerto Rican tanagers and Lesser Antillean pewees. Three maneuvers used for catching prey\u2014gleaning, sally-hovering and probing\u2014have been described. Gleaning is described as a hunting maneuver made by a standing or moving bird. Sally-hovering is a hunting maneuver made by a bird in flight. Probing is a maneuver in which the bird, by digging with its beak, forages the substrate looking for food in a manner similar to chickens. Gleaning, especially off leaves, is the maneuver used with more frequency by the elfin woods warbler while probing is the least used.\n\n","h_score":1796773.75,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":4143109,"revid":1130660605,"description":"Small bird of the New World warbler family endemic to Puerto Rico","categories":["Birds described in 1972","ESA threatened species","Endemic birds of Puerto Rico","Setophaga","Taxa named by Cameron B.

Conservationists are actively working to address threats like habitat destruction from deforestation and climate change, aiming to prevent its extinction.\n\n#### Habitat and Characteristics  \nThe Elfin woods warbler, scientifically named Setophaga angelae, inhabits the dwarf forests of Puerto Rico's mountains, where it nests in dense vegetation and feeds on insects. This species, discovered in 1972, is one of the rarest warblers in the world, with estimates suggesting only a few hundred individuals remain. Its gray and yellow plumage helps it blend into the misty, high-altitude environment, making it challenging for researchers to study.\n\n#### Threats and Conservation Status  \nHabitat loss due to agriculture, urban development, and natural disasters like hurricanes has pushed the Elfin woods warbler to the brink of extinction. Classified as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the bird's population has been monitored closely since the 1990s. \"The Elfin woods warbler is a vital indicator of forest health,\" said Dr. Maria Lopez, a biologist with the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources.\n\n#### Importance to Ecosystems  \nThis warbler plays a role in controlling insect populations and maintaining biodiversity in its fragile ecosystem. Its presence highlights the need for protecting Puerto Rico's unique montane forests, which also support other endangered species. \"Protecting this bird means safeguarding the entire habitat for future generations,\" noted environmentalist Juan Ramirez from the Sierra Club.  \n\nWith ongoing conservation measures, such as habitat restoration projects, the Elfin woods warbler could see population recovery in the years ahead."}

Precise calculations about the number who actually died in these camps are difficult to make. Newsweek reporter Roy Gutman claimed that US State Department officials, along with representatives of other Western governments, told him that 4,000\u20135,000 people, the vast majority of them non-Serbs, perished at Omarska. Journalist Bill Berkeley puts the death toll at 2,000. A member of the United Nations (UN) Commission of Experts testified during the trial of Du\u0161ko Tadi\u0107 at the ICTY that their number was in the thousands, but she could not be precise, despite the fact that Serbian officials confirmed there were no large scale releases of prisoners sent there. A member of the Crisis Committee, Simo Drlja\u010da, who served as chief of police for Prijedor, has stated that there were 6,000 \"informative conversations\" (meaning interrogations) in Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje, and that 1,503 non-Serbs were transferred from those three camps to Manja\u010da, leaving 4,497 unaccounted for according to Human Rights Watch. According to the Association of Camp Detainess of Prijedor 1992, between May and August 1992, around 6,000 prisoners passed through Omarska, 700 of whom were killed.\n\n ## International reaction\n\nIn early August 1992, Vulliamy, Independent Television News (ITN) reporter Penny Marshall, and Channel 4 News reporter Ian Williams gained access to the Omarska camp. Their reporting served as one of the catalysts of a UN effort to investigate war crimes committed in the conflict. The camp was closed less than a month after its exposure caused international uproar.\n\n ### 1997\u20132000 controversy\n\nBetween 1997 and 2000, there was academic and media controversy regarding the events that took place in Omarska and Trnopolje in 1992, due to claims of false reporting and \"lies\". These allegations, promoted by the state-controlled Radio Television of Serbia (RTS) and the British Living Marxism (LM) paper, prompted the ITN network to accuse the LM of libel; ITN won the case in 2000, effectively forcing the paper to close down.\n\n","h_score":1763648.1812500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":4038993,"revid":1173245575,"description":"1992 Bosnian Serb concentration camp","categories":["1992 disestablishments in Bosnia and Herzegovina","1992 establishments in Bosnia and Herzegovina","Anti-Muslim violence in Europe","Bosnian War internment camps","Bosnian genocide","Serbian concentration camps in the Yugoslav Wars","Serbian war crimes in the Bosnian War"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Ghosts of Omarska: Echoes of Atrocity in the Bosnian Hills\n\nIn the fog-shrouded valleys of northern Bosnia, Omarska camp stands as a chilling monument to the savagery of the 1992 Bosnian War, where ethnic hatred transformed a mining complex into a theater of terror. This site, operated by Bosnian Serb forces, became infamous for the systematic torture, killings, and dehumanization of thousands of Bosniak and Croat prisoners, encapsulating the broader horrors of ethnic cleansing that scarred the Balkans.\n\n**The Camp's Sinister Origins**  \nOmarska was hastily established in 1992 amid the chaos of Yugoslavia's disintegration, serving as a makeshift detention center to detain and interrogate perceived enemies. What began as a tool for control quickly devolved into a symbol of unchecked power, with prisoners herded into its iron gates like shadows vanishing into the earth.\n\n**Daily Nightmares Within the Wire**  \nInside, inmates endured unimaginable brutality: beatings, starvation, and psychological torment in overcrowded cells that reeked of fear and despair. As one survivor, Muhamed Filipovi\u0107, recalled, \"We were treated like animals in a slaughterhouse, our cries echoing unheard.\" Reports from human rights groups painted vivid pictures of the camp's role in the genocide, with another account from the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia stating, \"Omarska exemplified the calculated cruelty of war crimes.\"\n\n**Legacy and the Path to Reckoning**  \nThough the camp closed in 1992 under international pressure, its legacy lingers in the memories of survivors and the annals of justice, with key figures like camp commander \u017deljko Mejaki\u0107 facing war crimes trials. Memorials now dot the site, urging reflection on humanity's dark capacities.\n\nAs global tensions simmer, Omarska's story urges a vigilant eye toward preventing such echoes in tomorrow's conflicts."}

Bob Coie, a local builder, had bought a strip of land along the tracks in 1959 and acquired a large parcel along their west side in 1982. In 1985, he convinced the town to upzone the land for commercial use with the intention of eventually building a \"pre-planned business district\" and commuter rail station there. A state study of rail corridors was completed in 1994 and the Northeast Corridor was designated as the highest-priority line for commuter service to Providence. An addendum in 1995, assuming a quick start to operations, projected that daily ridership from Wickford would be 2,869 in 2000 and 3,386 in 2020. An operations plan was released in 2001, and environmental assessment was completed in 2003.\n\nBy November 2006, the station and associated track work was expected to cost \\$43.7 million, of which \\$24.99 million would be Federal Transit Administration New Starts funding. The station received a total of \\$59 million in federal funds, including the \\$24.99 million from New Starts and \\$4.35 million in stimulus funds. In late 2009, the State of Rhode Island spent \\$3.2 million to purchase 350,000 square feet (33,000 m<sup>2<\/sup>) of land for the station and parking garage, with hopes that it could be in service in 2011.\n\nGround was broken for the new station on August 18, 2010. Primary construction work on the station platform and garage was completed on time and under budget in December 2011, and a test train was run to the station in March 2012. The station opened on April 23, 2012. A major part of the modern station is the four-story parking garage, which was modeled after the nearby Lafayette Mill. The garage includes an indoor waiting room\u2014rare in the MBTA system\u2014and a small coffee\/snack shop. An 8-foot (2.4 m)-tall bronze sculpture celebrating the history of rail service at Wickford Junction was completed in October 2015.\n\n ### Ridership\n\nRidership at Wickford Junction has been far below projections, some of which had assumed that transit-oriented development would be constructed at the station. Daily boardings were projected to reach 3,544 in 2025 according to the 1995 analysis. This was reduced to 1,669 by 2020 in the 2003 Environmental Assessment, but raised again to 3,386 by 2020 in a 2005 analysis.\n\nInitial ridership in May 2012 was 130 inbound riders per day, of whom 80 percent rode to Providence and 20 percent to Boston. Ridership increased to 150 riders per day by early June and to 175 daily by February 2014.\n\nRidership averaged 292 daily boardings in the first quarter of 2017. For the second half of 2017, the state offered free intrastate rides in an attempt to promote the under-utilized T.F. Green Airport and Wickford Junction stations. The six-month promotion was expected to cost about \\$102,000. Ridership increased by 50% within the first month of the promotion. However, a 2018 count totalled only 235 daily boardings.\n\nAs of 2017 the station only has weekday service, but planners hope to add weekend service eventually. Previous official discussions about adding weekend service to T. F. Green Airport and Wickford Junction took place in 2014.\n\n","h_score":1772188.425,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":4073331,"revid":1148002071,"description":"Railway station in North Kingstown, RI","categories":["Buildings and structures in North Kingstown, Rhode Island","Former Amtrak stations in Rhode Island","Former New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad stations","MBTA Commuter Rail stations in Rhode Island","Railway stations in the United States opened in 2012","Stations on the Northeast Corridor","Transportation buildings and structures in Washington County, Rhode Island"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Wickford Junction Station: A Lifeline for Essex Commuters\n\nWickford Junction has long served as a bustling railway hub in Essex, England, facilitating daily connections between local residents and major destinations like London.

(born 22 November 1933) is a Singaporean poet and academic who is regarded as one of the pioneers of English literature in Singapore.\n\nThumboo graduated in English from the University of Malaya in 1956. Although he applied for a position at the university, he was rejected as few locals held academic posts at that time. He therefore worked in the civil service for about nine years before finally joining the university, then renamed the University of Singapore, in 1966 following Singapore's independence. He received a Ph.D. from the university in 1970. Thumboo rose to the position of full professor in the Department of English Language and Literature, heading the department between 1977 and 1993. After the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University in 1980 to form the National University of Singapore (NUS), he was the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences from 1980 to 1991, NUS's longest-serving dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. Thumboo was the first Chairman and Director of the university's Centre for the Arts from 1993 to 2005, and continues to be associated with the university as an emeritus professor, a position he has held since retiring from full-time teaching in September 1997.\n\nThumboo's poetry is inspired by myth and history, and he is often dubbed Singapore's unofficial poet laureate because of his poems with nationalistic themes. A pioneer of local English literature, he compiled and edited some of the first anthologies of English poetry and fiction from Singapore and Malaysia. His own collections of poetry include Rib of Earth (1956), Ulysses by the Merlion (1979) and A Third Map (1993). His latest anthology Still Travelling, consisting of almost 50 poems, was published in 2008. Thumboo has won the National Book Development Council of Singapore Book Awards for Poetry three times, in 1978, 1980 and 1994. He has also received the inaugural S.E.A. Write Award (1979), the first Cultural Medallion for Literature (1979), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Cultural and Communication Award (Literature) (1987), and the Raja Rao Award (2002). He was conferred a Bintang Bakti Masyarakat (Public Service Star) in 1981 with an additional Bar in 1991, and the Pingat Jasa Gemilang (Meritorious Services Medal) in 2006. He conceived the first National Poetry Festival for Singapore in 2015.\n\n ## Early years\n\nEdwin Thumboo, born in Singapore on 22 November 1933, was the eldest of eight children of a Tamil Indian schoolteacher and a Teochew-Peranakan Chinese housewife from a Singaporean merchant family. He and his siblings grew up speaking English and Teochew. The family was financially comfortable; their home in Mandai was the only one in the neighbourhood with electricity. Because of his mixed parentage, as a child he was sometimes called names and marginalized. This was said to have fostered determination and self-respect in him. He completed his primary education at Pasir Panjang Primary School in 1940. During the Japanese occupation of Singapore (1942\u20131945), he helped his family by selling cakes, tending goats, and working as a salesboy. Following the war, he studied at Monk's Hill Secondary School (finishing there in 1946) and Victoria School (1948). It was at the latter place that he began writing poetry at the age of 17 years, encouraged by the senior English master Shamus Frazer. Thumboo considers Frazer his spiritual father, and later dedicated Rib of Earth (1956), his first collection of poetry published while an undergraduate, to him. At this time, Thumboo was also a member of the Youth Poetry Circle, which counted among its members other early literary pioneers of Singapore such as Goh Sin Tub and Lim Thean Soo.\n\n","h_score":1835080.8187500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":3309640,"revid":1155524565,"description":"Singaporean poet and academic (born 1933)","categories":["1933 births","Academic staff of the National University of Singapore","International Writing Program alumni","Living people","Peranakan people in Singapore","Recipients of the Bintang Bakti Masyarakat","Recipients of the Cultural Medallion for literature","Recipients of the Pingat Jasa Gemilang","S.E.A.

Over the years different theories have been suggested for its purpose, linked with a range of dates for its creation.\n\nThe Tribal Hidage could have been a tribute list created upon the instructions of an Anglo-Saxon king such as Offa of Mercia, Wulfhere of Mercia or Edwin of Northumbria \u2014 but it may have been used for different purposes at various times during its history. Cyril Hart has described it as a tribute list created for Offa, but acknowledges that no proof exists that it was compiled during his rule. Higham notes that the syntax of the text requires that a word implying 'tribute' was omitted from each line, and argues that it was \"almost certainly a tribute list\". To Higham, the large size of the West Saxon hidation indicates that there was a link between the scale of tribute and any political considerations. James Campbell has argued that if the list served any practical purpose, it implies that tributes were assessed and obtained in an organised way, and notes that, \"whatever it is, and whatever it means, it indicates a degree of orderliness, or coherence in the exercise of power...\".\n\nYorke acknowledges that the purpose of the Tribal Hidage is unknown and that it may well not be, as has been commonly argued, an overlord's tribute list. She warns against assuming that the minor peoples (of 7000 hides or less) possessed any \"means of defining themselves as a distinct gentes\". Among these, the Isle of Wight and the South Gyrwe tribes, tiny in terms of their hidages and geographically isolated from other peoples, were among the few who possessed their own royal dynasties.\n\nP. H. Sawyer argues that the values may have had a symbolic purpose and that they were intended to be an expression of the status of each kingdom and province. To Sawyer, the obscurity of some of the tribal names and the absence from the list of others points to an early date for the original text, which he describes as a \"monument to Mercian power\". The 100,000 hides assigned to Wessex may have reflected its superior status at a later date and would imply that the Tribal Hidage in its present form was written in Wessex. The very large hidage assessment for Wessex was considered to be an error by the historian J. Brownbill, but Hart maintains that the value for Wessex is correct and that it was one of several assessments designed to exact the largest possible tribute from Mercia's main rivals.\n\n","h_score":1785292.0125000002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":4140416,"revid":1167927302,"description":"List of thirty-five Anglo-Saxon tribes","categories":["Anglo-Saxon kingdoms","Mercia","Texts of Anglo-Saxon England"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the Tribal Hidage?  \nA1: The Tribal Hidage is an ancient Anglo-Saxon document from around the 7th century, essentially a list of tribes or regions in early England along with their assessed tributes or taxes. It paints a vivid picture of a patchwork of kingdoms, much like a medieval map of power and wealth. This record offers a rare glimpse into the administrative side of early medieval life.\n\nQ2: When and where was it created?  \nA2: Scholars believe the Tribal Hidage was compiled in the 7th century, likely in southern England, during the height of Anglo-Saxon dominance. It may have originated in the kingdom of Mercia or nearby areas, reflecting the era's turbulent alliances and rivalries. Its exact origins remain somewhat mysterious, adding to its allure as a historical artifact.\n\nQ3: Who might have created it?  \nA3: The Tribal Hidage is thought to have been assembled by Anglo-Saxon rulers or their scribes, possibly under the direction of a powerful king like those from Mercia. It could have served as a tool for kings to organize tribute, much like a treasurer's ledger in a bustling court. While no specific author is named, it's a product of elite administrative circles.\n\nQ4: What does the document include?  \nA4: It features a list of around 30 to 35 tribes or territories, each with an estimated hidage\u2014a unit of land assessment for taxation purposes. This creates a rhythmic tally of resources, from the mighty kingdoms to smaller groups, evoking images of fertile lands under watchful overlords. The totals hint at the document's role in fiscal planning.\n\nQ5: Why is it significant for history?  \nA5: The Tribal Hidage provides crucial insights into the social and political structure of pre-unified England, helping trace the rise of major kingdoms. It illuminates how tribute systems wove together a tapestry of loyalties and conflicts, much like threads in a grand historical weave. For historians, it's a key puzzle piece in understanding Anglo-Saxon society.\n\nQ6: How does it relate to Anglo-Saxon England?  \nA6: In the context of Anglo-Saxon England, the Tribal Hidage reflects the era's fragmented power dynamics, where kings demanded tribute to fund wars and alliances. It underscores the transition from tribal chaos to more organized states, like waves shaping a coastline over time. This document highlights the economic foundations of early English culture.\n\nQ7: Are there any uncertainties about it?  \nA7: Experts debate the Tribal Hidage's exact date, purpose, and even authenticity, as it's only known through later copies without an original. Some see it as a genuine administrative record, while others view it as a later compilation with embellishments, like a faded echo of the past. These nuances keep it a lively topic in historical discussions.\n\nQ8: How is it studied today?  \nA8: Modern scholars use the Tribal Hidage to explore themes like early taxation and territorial boundaries, often cross-referencing it with other sources for a fuller picture. It sparks engaging debates in academic circles, serving as a bridge to visualize ancient England's vibrant, if shadowy, world. Its legacy endures, inspiring fresh interpretations in books and lectures."}

Hahn dismissed the isotope with the 3.5-hour half-life as contamination, but after looking at the details of the Paris group's experiments and the decay curves, Strassmann was worried. He decided to repeat the experiment, using his more efficient method of separating radium. This time, they found what they thought was radium, which Hahn suggested resulted from two alpha decays: <sup>238<\/sup> <sub>92<\/sub>U + n \u2192 \u03b1 + <sup>235<\/sup> <sub>90<\/sub>Th \u2192 \u03b1 + <sup>235<\/sup> <sub>88<\/sub>Ra Meitner found this very hard to believe. In November, Hahn travelled to Copenhagen, where he met with Bohr and Meitner. They told him that they were very unhappy about the proposed radium isomers. On Meitner's instructions, Hahn and Strassmann began to redo the experiments, even as Fermi was collecting his Nobel Prize in Stockholm. Assisted by Clara Lieber and Irmgard Bohne, they isolated the three radium isotopes (verified by their half-lives) and used fractional crystallisation to separate them from the barium carrier by adding barium bromide crystals in four steps. Since radium precipitates preferentially in a solution of barium bromide, at each step the fraction drawn off would contain less radium than the one before. However, they found no difference between each of the fractions. In case their process was faulty in some way, they verified it with known isotopes of radium; the process was fine. On 19 December, Hahn wrote to Meitner, informing her that the radium isotopes behaved chemically like barium. Anxious to finish up before the Christmas break, Hahn and Strassmann submitted their findings to Naturwissenschaften on 22 December without waiting for Meitner to reply. Hahn understood that a \"burst\" of the atomic nuclei had occurred, but he was unsure about that interpretation. Hahn concluded the article in \"Naturwissenschaften\" with: \"As chemists... we should substitute the symbols Ba, La, Ce for Ra, Ac, Th. As 'nuclear chemists' fairly close to physics we cannot yet bring ourselves to take this step which contradicts all previous experience in physics.\" Frisch normally celebrated Christmas with Meitner in Berlin, but in 1938 she accepted an invitation from Eva von Bahr to spend it with her family at Kung\u00e4lv, and Meitner asked Frisch to join her there. Meitner received the letter from Hahn describing his chemical proof that some of the product of the bombardment of uranium with neutrons was barium. Barium had an atomic mass 40% less than uranium, and no previously known methods of radioactive decay could account for such a large difference in the mass of the nucleus.","h_score":1773308.4125000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":64011351,"revid":1173859491,"description":"1938 achievement in physics","categories":["1938 in science","December 1938 events","Nuclear chemistry","Nuclear fission","Nuclear physics","Radioactivity"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is nuclear fission?  \nA1: Nuclear fission is the process where a heavy atomic nucleus, like uranium, splits into smaller nuclei when hit by a neutron, releasing enormous energy. This splitting unleashes a chain reaction, producing more neutrons and vast amounts of heat. It's like a cosmic domino effect, transforming matter into raw power.\n\nQ2: Who discovered nuclear fission?  \nA2: The discovery is credited to German scientists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, with crucial theoretical insights from Lise Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch. Hahn and Strassmann conducted the experiments, while Meitner and Frisch explained the physics behind it. Their collaboration unveiled a force that would reshape the world.\n\nQ3: When was nuclear fission first discovered?  \nA3: The key experiments were performed in late 1938, with Hahn and Strassmann publishing their findings in early 1939. This breakthrough built on earlier nuclear research from the 1930s, marking a pivotal moment in science. Imagine it as a spark that ignited the atomic age.\n\nQ4: What led to the discovery of nuclear fission?  \nA4: Scientists were bombarding uranium atoms with neutrons to study radioactive elements, expecting to create heavier isotopes. Instead, Hahn and Strassmann detected lighter elements like barium, which puzzled them at first. This unexpected result, like uncovering a hidden treasure, prompted deeper investigation.\n\nQ5: How did the experiments work?  \nA5: Hahn and Strassmann irradiated uranium with neutrons and analyzed the resulting products using chemical techniques. They found that the uranium had split into fragments, defying conventional expectations. This hands-on detective work revealed the fission process, much like piecing together a scientific puzzle.\n\nQ6: What role did Lise Meitner play?  \nA6: As a physicist exiled from Germany due to her Jewish heritage, Meitner interpreted Hahn's data and, with Frisch, explained fission as a nucleus vibrating and splitting apart. Her theoretical work was essential, though she was often overlooked in credit. It's a story of brilliance shining through adversity.\n\nQ7: Why was the discovery initially misunderstood?  \nA7: Early results were confusing because they challenged existing atomic theories, leading Hahn to hesitate in his conclusions. Meitner's explanation clarified it as a new phenomenon, not just radioactivity. This nuance highlights how science evolves, turning confusion into clarity like dawn breaking over a horizon.\n\nQ8: What were the broader implications of nuclear fission?  \nA8: The discovery paved the way for nuclear power and weapons, dramatically altering energy production and global politics. It raised ethical questions about its destructive potential, as seen in atomic bombs. Today, it powers reactors worldwide, a double-edged sword of innovation and peril."}

Foraker","reference":"### Defeat for re-election In the aftermath of the Gridiron Dinner, Foraker was increasingly ostracized, both politically and socially. Unwelcome at the White House, he was excluded from patronage. Nevertheless, the Committee on Military Affairs, on which Foraker sat, went ahead and held hearings into the Brownsville matter between February and June 1907. Author John Weaver, in his 1997 book on the Brownsville case, takes note of \"Foraker's masterful presentation of fact and law\", including his cross-examination of witnesses who sought to convince the committee of the soldiers' guilt. In March 1908, the committee issued its report, by a vote of 9\u20134 endorsing the President's action. While the official minority report found the evidence inconclusive, Foraker and Connecticut senator Morgan Bulkeley signed a separate report stating that \"the weight of the testimony shows that none of the soldiers of the Twenty-fifth U.S. Infantry participated in the shooting affray\". Although he knew he had little chance of winning, Foraker challenged Taft, his fellow Cincinnatian, for the Republican nomination for president. He hoped to secure a deal whereby he would endorse Taft in exchange for support in the senatorial election to be held in January 1909. Roosevelt was determined to drive Foraker from politics, and Taft refused to deal. Taft won at each stage of the delegate-selection process, gaining all but two delegates from Ohio. At the 1908 Republican National Convention, Taft received 702 votes and was nominated; Foraker received 16, of which 11 came from blacks. After failing to capture the Republican presidential nomination, Foraker concentrated on campaigning for re-election to the Senate. His vote on the Hepburn Act and his opposition to Roosevelt had provoked opposition to him within the Ohio Republican Party; in addition, both he and Dick were seen by some as the face of the old guard of the party, out of place in the Progressive Era. Many of those who opposed him proposed Congressman Theodore E. Burton for the Senate seat; Foraker stated that the first thing to do was secure a Republican legislature, with the question of who should be senator left until victory was obtained. Amid speculation as to Taft's position on Foraker, the two men met, to all appearances cordially, on September 2 at the Grand Army of the Republic encampment at Toledo, and later that day, the two men appeared on the same platform. Taft spoke in appreciation of Foraker, who, as governor, had appointed him as a judge, giving him his start in public life. Foraker, for his part, stated that Taft would be his party leader during the campaign, and called on the presidential candidate at his headquarters in Cincinnati a week later. The Taft campaign asked Foraker to preside, and to introduce Taft, at a rally to be held at the Cincinnati Music Hall on September 22.

Foraker\n\nJoseph B. Foraker, a prominent Republican figure from Ohio, played a key role in American politics during the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a governor and senator. His career highlighted issues of civil rights, territorial governance, and party loyalty, influencing debates on race and imperialism.\n\n#### Early Life and Political Rise\nBorn in 1846 in Ohio, Joseph B. Foraker served in the Union Army during the Civil War before entering politics. He rose to prominence as Ohio's governor from 1886 to 1890 and later as a U.S. Senator from 1897 to 1909, where he advocated for Republican policies amid the nation's post-war expansion. Foraker's background as a lawyer and soldier shaped his conservative approach to governance, focusing on state rights and economic growth.\n\n#### Major Contributions and Controversies\nForaker is best known for the Foraker Act of 1900, which established a civil government in Puerto Rico following the Spanish-American War, balancing U.S. oversight with local autonomy. However, his opposition to federal voting rights protections drew criticism, as seen in his stance against the Lodge Bill. \"The South must handle its own affairs,\" Foraker once stated, reflecting his views on limited federal intervention, according to historical records. A contemporary critic, journalist Ray Stannard Baker, noted, \"Foraker's policies often prioritized party unity over racial equality.\"\n\n#### Lasting Impact\nForaker's influence extended to shaping early 20th-century Republican strategies, though his career ended amid scandals like the 1908 bribery investigations. Historians view his legacy as a mix of progressive territorial reforms and conservative setbacks in civil rights.\n\nLooking ahead, Foraker's approach to U.S. territorial policy continues to inform debates on federal oversight in modern American territories."}

He wrote the song when his first-grade daughter came home crying after a boy pushed her off the slide. He blurted out three reasons for the incident to comfort her: the boy liked her, people can be strange, and it's \"human nature\". He recorded a rough demo of the song in their studio while the Toto song \"Africa\" was being mixed. Fellow Toto keyboardist David Paich added some synthesizer strings on top of the demo. Originally, the song was offered to Toto but they passed on it as they preferred stadium rock-oriented material. Paich had prepared some demo tracks for producer Quincy Jones to listen to as possible songs for Thriller and asked Porcaro to make Jones a tape with the songs. Running low on cassette tapes, Porcaro used the tape on which he had already recorded his \"Human Nature\" demo, putting Paich's songs on the reverse side and marking that on the label as the side that Jones should listen to. Jones listened to Paich's songs but did not think they were right for Thriller. However, he did not stop the tape when the songs finished playing, and the cassette deck playing the tape had \"auto-reverse\" capability, meaning that it started playing the other side as soon as the first side was finished. As Jones described it, \"All of a sudden, at the end, there was all this silence, there was: 'why, why, dah dah da-dum dah dah, why, why'. Just a dummy lyric and a very skeletal thing\u2014I get goosebumps talking about it. I said, 'This is where we wanna go, because it's got such a wonderful flavor'\". However, Jones was dissatisfied with the original lyrics for the verses and asked John Bettis, who had written lyrics for hits by the Carpenters and the Pointer Sisters, among others, to write new lyrics for the song. He completed the song in two days. Jones asked if the song could be included on Jackson's album, to which Porcaro and Bettis agreed. Porcaro discusses Bettis' input in \"Human Nature\": > \"At the last minute, Quincy (Jones) asked me if I\u2019d mind if John Bettis took a shot at the verse lyrics, and I said, 'No, not at all.' I didn't consider myself a great lyricist. Sometimes what just came out of my mouth when I was writing, I mean like the chorus on \"Human Nature\" could be keepers. But I was wide open. But with John Bettis, I didn't change a single syllable, he just nailed it. He turned my record into a song, with a beginning, middle and end. Those lyrics are amazing and I don't talk about that enough.\" The song, as it turns out, did not change much musically from the demo through to the final album, as Jones liked the song as it was. It was, for the most part, recreated in the studio. Even engineer Bruce Swedien asked Porcaro, who played most of the parts and helped Jackson with the vocal phrasing, to help reproduce the phrasing of the accents of the \"Why, why\" that can be heard on the demo.","h_score":1751457.58125,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":3282937,"revid":1165786851,"description":"1983 song by Michael Jackson","categories":["1980s ballads","1982 songs","1983 singles","American soft rock songs","Contemporary R&B ballads","Epic Records singles","Michael Jackson songs","Rock ballads","Song recordings produced by Quincy Jones","Songs about New York City","Songs with lyrics by John Bettis","Songs written by Steve Porcaro"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is \"Human Nature\" by Michael Jackson?  \nA1: \"Human Nature\" is a soulful ballad from Michael Jackson's iconic 1982 album \"Thriller,\" exploring themes of longing and emotional vulnerability.

This song reminds us that even in a fast-paced world, human emotions remain timeless."}

The brown thrasher is abundant throughout the eastern and central United States and southern and central Canada, and it is the only thrasher to live primarily east of the Rockies and central Texas. It is the state bird of Georgia.\n\nAs a member of the genus Toxostoma, the bird is relatively large-sized among the other thrashers. It has brown upper parts with a white under part with dark streaks. Because of this, it is often confused with the smaller wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), among other species. The brown thrasher is noted for having over 1000 song types, and the largest song repertoire of birds. However, each note is usually repeated in two or three phrases.\n\nThe brown thrasher is an omnivore, with its diet ranging from insects to fruits and nuts. The usual nesting areas are shrubs, small trees, or at times on ground level. Brown thrashers are generally inconspicuous but territorial birds, especially when defending their nests, and will attack species as large as humans.\n\n ## Taxonomy and naming\n\nThe brown thrasher was originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae as Turdus rufus. The genus name Toxostoma comes from the Ancient Greek toxon, \"bow\" or \"arch\" and stoma, \"mouth\". The specific rufum is Latin for \"red\", but covers a wider range of hues than the English term.\n\nAlthough not in the thrush family, this bird is sometimes erroneously called the brown thrush. The name misconception could be because the word thrasher is believed to derive from the word thrush. The naturalist Mark Catesby called it the fox-coloured thrush.\n\nGenetic studies have found that the brown thrasher is most closely related to the long-billed and Cozumel thrashers (T. longirostre & guttatum), within the genus Toxostoma.\n\n","h_score":1826470.7312500002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":33731262,"revid":1170470307,"description":"Species of bird","categories":["Birds described in 1758","Birds of Canada","Native birds of the Canadian Prairies","Native birds of the Eastern United States","Native birds of the Plains-Midwest (United States)","Symbols of Georgia (U.S. state)","Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus","Thrashers","Toxostoma"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"# The Brown Thrasher: Nature's Fiery Songweaver\n\nIn the tangled underbrush of North American woodlands, the brown thrasher emerges as a master mimic and melodious enigma, captivating birdwatchers with its bold stripes and relentless chatter. This unassuming bird, often overshadowed by flashier feathered kin, plays a vital role in ecosystems by controlling insect populations and spreading seeds, making it a quirky guardian of biodiversity.\n\n### A Vibrant Vagabond in the Wild\nWith its rich, reddish-brown plumage streaked like a painter's wild brushstrokes and a tail that flicks with dramatic flair, the brown thrasher thrives in thickets and suburban edges across the eastern United States. This bird's feisty personality shines through in its territorial displays, where it scratches the ground like a determined archaeologist unearthing hidden treasures. \"The brown thrasher's mimicry is pure avian theater,\" notes ornithologist Dr. Emily Rivers, capturing its talent for weaving other birds' calls into its own symphony.\n\n### Melodic Magic and Mischief\nRenowned for its extensive repertoire of over 1,000 song variations, the brown thrasher turns ordinary dawn into a improvisational opera, blending whistles, rattles, and even mechanical sounds into an unexpected auditory adventure. Its performances aren't just for show; they serve as fierce defenses of territory and mates, adding a layer of intrigue to backyard birding. As wildlife expert Roger Peterson once observed, \"This bird's voice is a whirlwind of surprises, turning the mundane into magic.\"\n\n### Threats and Tenacious Survival\nFacing habitat loss from urban sprawl and climate shifts, the brown thrasher must navigate a world of shrinking wild spaces, yet it adapts with remarkable resilience. Conservation efforts focus on preserving its preferred brushy habitats, highlighting the need for balanced human expansion. Looking ahead, as environmental changes accelerate, the brown thrasher's adaptive spirit may inspire new strategies for protecting our feathered friends."}

Following preparations in Japan, 3 RAR arrived in Pusan on 28 September 1950 and was attached to the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade. The initial invasion of South Korea by the North Korean People's Army (NKPA) had been broken by General Douglas MacArthur's amphibious landing at Inchon, and so, in what was a complicated war of manoeuvre, 3 RAR was involved in the pursuit of the NKPA back across the 38th parallel. On 21 October 1950, 3 RAR took part in the Battle of Yongyu in an apple orchard north of Pyongyang, the first large-scale engagement fought by a battalion of the regiment. The farthest north 3 RAR would advance into North Korea was the Pakchon\u2013Chongju area following the Battle of Chongju, and it was near here that Lieutenant Colonel Charlie Green, the battalion's commanding officer, was mortally wounded on 30 October 1950. By November 1950, following the Chinese intervention, 3 RAR was withdrawing south along with the rest of the allied Eighth Army, fighting the Battle of Pakchon. However, following a UN counteroffensive a defensive line was established about 45 kilometres (28 mi) north of Seoul and it was here in April 1951 that 3 RAR, along with the 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry and supporting UN forces, fought a successful defensive action at the Battle of Kapyong. This battle proved to be the climactic point of the regiment's first year in Korea. By June 1951, 3 RAR moved to a position on the Imjin River under the command of the US I Corps and it was here that the battalion would spend the next two years of the war. The major action fought by the regiment in the second half of 1951 was the Battle of Maryang San, where 3 RAR, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Frank Hassett, assaulted Hill 317 on 5 October 1951. Known as Operation Commando, Hill 317 was captured after five days of hard fighting. Following this action the war was defined by fixed defences of trenches, bunkers and wire, constant patrolling, and numerous clashes. In April 1952, 3 RAR was joined by 1 RAR and command of the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade, of which they were now a part, passed to an Australian officer as a result. Meanwhile, the expansion of the commitment in Korea to two battalions resulted in the establishment of a regimental depot at Ingleburn in 1952 to train and hold infantrymen for service in Korea. In April 1953, 1 RAR was replaced by 2 RAR on a system of unit rotation. During this changeover a parade was held to mark the first occasion that all battalions of the regiment had been on parade together. 1 RAR served a year in Korea, 2 RAR for four months before the armistice, while 3 RAR served throughout the war, earning itself the nickname of \"Old Faithful\". The last major action of the war for the regiment was the Battle of the Samichon River fought by 2 RAR over 24\u201326 July 1953, repulsing a number of major Chinese assaults just hours before the Armistice Agreement was signed. Following the armistice both sides withdrew and a demilitarised zone was created. The period that followed proved uneventful, yet the UN forces were required to maintain combat readiness and the ability to react quickly in case the North Koreans violated the ceasefire. In April 1954, 2 RAR returned to Australia and was replaced by 1 RAR which remained in South Korea until March 1956. 3 RAR finally returned to Australia in September 1954 after four years of continuous service in Korea and five years before that in Japan. Total Army casualties in Korea included 293 killed, 1,210 wounded and 23 captured, the majority being infantrymen of the Royal Australian Regiment. The fighting in Korea provided the regiment with valuable combat experience, establishing a foundation for its further development and marking the emergence of the Australian Regular Army. The Korean War remains the only large-scale, conventional war that the regiment has fought. During this time the Army developed the capability to maintain two battalions on major operations at the same time.","h_score":1819477.9625000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":977549,"revid":1164538181,"description":"Administrative regiment for regular infantry battalions of the Australian Army","categories":["1948 establishments in Australia","Australian army units with royal patronage","Infantry regiments of Australia","Military units and formations established in 1948","Regiments of the Korean War","Royal Australian Regiment"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the Royal Australian Regiment?  \nA1: The Royal Australian Regiment is an infantry regiment in the Australian Army.

The advertising campaign was built around the slogans 'Led Zeppelin \u2013 The Only Way to Fly' and 'Led Zeppelin II Now Flying'. In the United States, some commercially duplicated reel-to-reel copies of Led Zeppelin II made by Ampex bore the title Led Zeppelin II \u2013 The Only Way to Fly on their spine. Commercially, Led Zeppelin II was the band's first album to hit No. 1 in the US, knocking The Beatles' Abbey Road (1969) twice from the top spot, where it remained for seven weeks. By April 1970 it had registered three million American sales, whilst in Britain it enjoyed a 138-week residence on the LP chart, climbing to the top spot in February 1970. Meanwhile, the album reached the top spot in other 5 national albums charts (including Canadian, Australian and Spanish albums charts). In November Ritchie Yorke reported in Billboard that while the album had achieved \"staggering\" sales, as a hard rock record it was considered unsuitable for North American Top 40 radio stations, who were \"dreary and detached from the mainstream of contemporary rock music\". The album also yielded Led Zeppelin's biggest hit, \"Whole Lotta Love\". This song reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in January 1970, after Atlantic went against the group's wishes by releasing a shorter version on 45. The single's B-side, \"Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)\", also hit the Billboard chart, peaking at No. 65 in April 1970. The album helped establish Led Zeppelin as an international concert attraction, and for the next year, the group continued to tour relentlessly, initially performing in clubs and ballrooms, then in larger auditoriums and eventually stadiums as their popularity grew. Led Zeppelin II was not well-received by contemporary music critics. John Mendelsohn wrote a negative review of the record for Rolling Stone, in which he mocked the group's heavy sound and white blues, while writing that \"until you've listened to the album eight hundred times, as I have, it seems as if it's just one especially heavy song extended over the space of two whole sides\". In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau jokingly referred to the band as \"the best of the wah-wah mannerist groups, so dirty they drool on demand\", while complaining that \"all the songs sound alike\", before assigning the album a \"B\" grade. He nonetheless conceded in 1970 that \"Led Zeppelin simply out-heavied everyone\" the previous year, \"pitting Jimmy Page's repeated low-register fuzz riffs against the untiring freak intensity of Robert Plant's vocal. This trademark has only emerged clearly on the second album, and more and more I am coming to understand it as an artistic triumph.\" On 10 November 1969, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America and in 1990 it was certified 5\u00d7 platinum reflecting shipping of five million copies. By 14 November 1999, Led Zeppelin II had shipped twelve million copies and was certified 12\u00d7 platinum by the RIAA. The 2014 reissue of the album helped itself get back into the Billboard Top 10 when it got to .","h_score":1811169.1500000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":50239,"revid":1172425629,"description":null,"categories":["1969 albums","Albums involved in plagiarism controversies","Albums produced by Jimmy Page","Albums recorded at A&M Studios","Albums recorded at Morgan Sound Studios","Albums recorded at Olympic Sound Studios","Albums recorded at Sunset Sound Recorders","Atlantic Records albums","Led Zeppelin albums"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Led Zeppelin II: The Album That Redefined Rock\n\nIn 1969, Led Zeppelin II burst onto the scene as a raw, electrifying follow-up to the band's debut, blending blistering guitar riffs and powerful vocals to capture the essence of the era's rock evolution. This iconic record not only topped charts worldwide but also cemented Led Zeppelin's legacy as innovators, influencing countless genres with its high-energy tracks and studio experimentation.\n\n#### The Making of the Album\nLed Zeppelin II was recorded amid the band's relentless touring schedule, with sessions taking place in various studios across Europe and the U.S., reflecting the chaotic creativity of the late 1960s. Jimmy Page, the band's guitarist, drove the production, incorporating innovative techniques like overdubbing to amplify the album's intense sound. As Page once said, \"We were capturing the fire of our live performances in a way that felt urgent and alive.\"\n\n#### Standout Tracks and Reception\nThe album features powerhouse hits like \"Whole Lotta Love\" and \"Rambling On,\" which showcased Robert Plant's soaring vocals and John Bonham's thunderous drumming, creating a blueprint for heavy rock. Critics and fans alike praised its blend of blues roots and hard-edged innovation, propelling it to multi-platinum status shortly after release. Music historian Robert Palmer noted, \"Led Zeppelin II represented a seismic shift, turning rock into a more visceral, guitar-driven force.\"\n\n#### Cultural Impact and Legacy\nBeyond its immediate success, Led Zeppelin II influenced heavy metal, hard rock, and even modern genres like grunge, with its bold riffs echoing in bands from the 1970s onward. The album's themes of love, travel, and mythology added layers of depth, making it a timeless staple in rock history.\n\nAs the music industry embraces new fusions, the unbridled energy of Led Zeppelin II continues to inspire contemporary artists exploring rock's roots."}

Scott Hamilton, who was replaced at NBC by Lipinski, Weir, and Gannon, called them a \"phenomenon\" and \"such a breath of fresh air\". GQ called their commentating style \"a Gladwell-ian ability to demystify figure skating for the uninitiated and an extreme candor for which they've caught some heat\". Cosmopolitan considered Lipinski and Weir's commentating style honest and colorful, and noted that they used banter and avoided what the magazine called \"fluffy, polished performances\". They tried to present figure skating in an accessible way to their viewers, keeping the more technical aspects of the sport to a minimum but emphasizing its \"gossipy nuances\". Sports writer and media critic Bill Goodykoontz named their enthusiasm for figure skating their \"calling card\". In Dick Button's opinion, Lipinski and Weir were \"excellent\", but that Lipinski \"might talk a little too much\", although Tom Weir stated that when skaters were \"elegant and error-free\", both Lipinski and Weir had \"the good sense to stay silent\". Goodykoontz pointed out that Lipinski and Weir were uncharacteristically quiet during the short program of Kamila Valieva, representing the Russian Olympic Committee, who was allowed to compete despite failing a drug test prior to the 2022 Winter Olympics. They chose to simply announce Valieva's jumps and express their opinions that she should not have been allowed to compete afterwards instead. In 2018 and 2019, Lipinski and Weir hosted and appeared in a few shows on Food Network, including two seasons of Wedding Cake Challenge. In 2022, Lipinski co-hosted Wedding Talk with event planner Jos\u00e9 Rol\u00f3n and wedding designer Jove Meyer, produced by Chicken Soup for the Soul Studios. In the same year, Lipinski and her husband, Todd Kapostasy, a sports producer and documentary director, co-produced Meddling: The Olympic Skating Scandal That Shocked the World, a four-part documentary series focusing on the skating controversy at the 2002 Winter Olympics, which was aired on the NBC streaming service Peacock in January 2022. Lipinski, who called the series \"a deep and responsible look at what happened\", said that she and Kapostasy chose to create the series because it was the 20th anniversary of the scandal and there had been no comprehensive look at what happened. They interviewed people in Russia, France, and Canada who were involved in the scandal.

Worthy and Berinthia, complains Collier, are allowed to enact their wiles against the Lovelesses' married virtue without being punished or losing face. The subplot is an even worse offence against religion and morality, as it positively rewards vice, allowing the trickster hero Tom to keep the girl, her dowry, and his own bad character to the end. Vanbrugh failed to take Short View seriously and published a joking reply, but Collier's censure was to colour the perception of the play for centuries. While it remained a popular stage piece through the 18th century, much praised and enjoyed for its wit, attitudes to its casual sexual morality became increasingly ambivalent as public opinion became ever more restrictive in this area, and more at odds with the permissive ethos of Restoration comedy. From 1777 Vanbrugh's original was replaced on the stage by Sheridan's A Trip to Scarborough, a close adaptation but with some \"covering\", as the prologue explains, drawn over Vanbrugh's \"too bare\" wit: As change thus circulates throughout the nation, Some plays may justly call for alteration; At least to draw some slender covering o'er, That graceless wit which was too bare before. Sheridan does not allow Loveless and Berinthia to consummate their relationship, and he withdraws approval from Amanda's admirer Worthy by renaming him \"Townly\". Some frank quips are silently deleted, and the matchmaker Coupler with the lecherous interest in Tom becomes decorous Mrs Coupler. A small-scale but notable loss is of much of the graphic language of Hoyden's nurse, who is earthy in Vanbrugh's original, genteel in Sheridan. However, Sheridan had an appreciation of Vanbrugh's style, and retained most of the original text unaltered.","h_score":1760807.70625,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":216855,"revid":1097524186,"description":"1696 Restoration comedy written by John Vanbrugh","categories":["1696 plays","Adultery in plays","Plays by John Vanbrugh","Plays set in the 17th century","Restoration comedy","Sequel plays"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Shadow of Relapse: A Common Yet Overlooked Setback in Recovery\n\nRelapse, the unexpected resurgence of addictive behaviors or symptoms after a period of improvement, affects millions globally and underscores the fragility of long-term recovery efforts. Experts warn that without proper support systems, this phenomenon can derail progress and lead to severe emotional and physical consequences.\n\n#### Understanding Relapse\nRelapse is not a sign of failure but a complex phase in the recovery process, often involving a mix of psychological triggers and environmental factors. It can manifest in various forms, from substance abuse to mental health episodes, painting a vivid picture of the human struggle against invisible chains. As Dr. Emily Carter, a leading addiction specialist, notes, \"Relapse is like a storm that brews quietly; it reminds us that recovery is a marathon, not a sprint.\"\n\n#### Factors Contributing to Relapse\nSeveral elements fuel relapse, including stress, social influences, and underlying mental health issues, which act as hidden tripwires in an otherwise steady path. This turbulent cycle highlights how everyday pressures can erode the foundations of recovery, turning triumphs into temporary setbacks. Common triggers range from emotional turmoil to physical cravings, emphasizing the need for vigilant monitoring.\n\n#### Strategies for Prevention and Support\nEffective prevention involves tailored therapy, community networks, and lifestyle changes to build resilience against potential pitfalls. By fostering a supportive environment, individuals can navigate these challenges with greater strength and clarity.

At the time, the film rights were owned by Michael Laughlin, who gave up his option from Tribune Media Services after he was unsuccessful in pitching Dick Tracy to Hollywood studios. Floyd Mutrux and Art Linson purchased the film rights from the Tribune in 1977, and, in 1980, United Artists became interested in financing\/distributing Dick Tracy. Tom Mankiewicz was under negotiations to write the script, based on his previous success with Superman (1978) and Superman II (1980). The deal fell through when Chester Gould, creator of the Dick Tracy comic strip, insisted on strict financial and artistic control. That same year, Mutrux and Linson eventually took the property to Paramount Pictures, who began developing screenplays, offered Steven Spielberg the director's position, and brought in Universal Pictures to co-finance. Universal put John Landis forward as a candidate for director, courted Clint Eastwood for the title role, and commissioned Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr. to write the screenplay. \"Before we were brought on, there were several failed scripts at Universal,\" reflected Epps, \"then it went dormant, but John Landis was interested in Dick Tracy, and he brought us in to write it.\" Cash and Epps' simple orders from Landis were to write the script in a 1930s pulp magazine atmosphere and center it with Alphonse \"Big Boy\" Caprice as the primary villain. For research, Epps read every Dick Tracy comic strip from 1930 to 1957. The writers wrote two drafts for Landis; Max Allan Collins, then-writer of the Dick Tracy comic strip, remembers reading one of them. \"It was terrible. The only positive thing about it was a thirties setting and lots of great villains, but the story was paper-thin and it was uncomfortably campy.\" In addition to Beatty and Eastwood, other actors who were considered for the lead role included Harrison Ford, Richard Gere, Tom Selleck, and Mel Gibson. Landis left Dick Tracy following the controversial on-set accident on Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983), in which three actors were killed. Walter Hill then came on board to direct with Joel Silver as producer. Cash and Epps wrote another draft, and Hill approached Warren Beatty for the title role. Pre-production had progressed as far as set building, but the film was stalled when artistic control issues arose with Beatty, a fan of the Dick Tracy comic strip. Hill wanted to make the film violent and realistic, while Beatty envisioned a stylized homage to the 1930s comic strip. The actor also reportedly wanted \\$5 million plus fifteen percent of the box office gross, a deal which Universal refused to accept. Hill and Beatty left the film, which Paramount began developing as a lower-budget project with Richard Benjamin directing. Cash and Epps continued to rewrite the script, but Universal was unsatisfied. The film rights eventually reverted to Tribune Media Services in 1985. However, Beatty decided to option the Dick Tracy rights himself for \\$3 million, along with the Cash\/Epps script.","h_score":1849969.7750000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":725984,"revid":1171553346,"description":"1990 action crime film directed by Warren Beatty","categories":["1990 action comedy films","1990 films","1990s American films","1990s English-language films","1990s crime action films","1990s crime comedy films","1990s police procedural films","American action comedy films","American crime action films","American crime comedy films","Dick Tracy films","Films based on comic strips","Films directed by Warren Beatty","Films produced by Warren Beatty","Films scored by Danny Elfman","Films set around New Year","Films set in 1938","Films set in the 1930s","Films shot in Los Angeles","Films that won the Academy Award for Best Makeup","Films that won the Best Original Song Academy Award","Films whose art director won the Best Art Direction Academy Award","Films with screenplays by Bo Goldman","Live-action films based on comics","Mafia comedy films","Touchstone Pictures films"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the 1990 film Dick Tracy about?  \nA1: Dick Tracy is a comic book adaptation centered on a detective named Dick Tracy who battles organized crime in a stylized 1930s setting.

Although it was eventually fixed, the bug became the subject of controversy and Sinclair was forced to replace some of the ZX81s sold to early customers. On a more positive note, Vickers' work on the manual was received favourably, being described in 1983 as \"one of the classic texts on BASIC\". Max Phillips commented in a What Micro? retrospective: > It does a reasonable job and sensibly provides lots for the reader to do. It's quite honest about the [ZX81]'s shortcomings and provides hints and tips for ways round them ... Best of all, the manual is complete and comprehensive. There's some fairly advanced and often undisclosed information in there. The beginner won't understand it for a long time but if he or she learns some more advanced ideas, the manual is ready for them. The task of designing the ZX81's case again fell to Rick Dickinson, who produced an updated version of the ZX80's wedge-shaped case. This time round, the design team were able to use injection moulding, which enabled them to deliver a higher-quality case. Dickinson originally envisaged the ZX81 as \"an expandable range of boxes following a vaguely modular approach with a common width\", though this approach was eventually dropped. From start to finish, the design process took about six months. The ZX81 was launched on 5 March 1981 in two versions (though with identical components) \u2013 a pre-assembled machine or a cheaper kit version, which the user could assemble himself. Both versions were manufactured in Dundee, Scotland by Timex Corporation at the company's Dryburgh factory. Timex had not been an obvious choice of manufacturing subcontractor, as the company had little previous experience in assembling electronics. It was a well-established manufacturer of mechanical watches but was facing a crisis at the beginning of the 1980s. Profits had dwindled to virtually zero as the market for mechanical watches stagnated in the face of competition from the digital and quartz watches. Recognising the trend, Timex's director, Fred Olsen, determined that the company would diversify into other areas of business. This shift by Timex came at an ideal time for Sinclair. The ZX80 had proved more popular than expected and Sinclair's existing manufacturer, a small electronics company in St Ives, lacked the resources to deal with the demand. Timex took over production of the ZX80 late in 1980. The arrangement worked well for both companies and Timex took on the manufacture of the ZX81, aided by capital investment in its Dundee plant. Sinclair initially planned to produce 10,000 ZX81s a month, rising to 30,000 a month within a year. However, Timex initially had significant problems in producing enough ZX81s to satisfy demand. As a consequence, it took up to nine weeks for ZX81s to be delivered by mail order.","h_score":1778073.03125,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":34475,"revid":1171112341,"description":"Inexpensive home computer by Sinclair Research, 1981","categories":["1980s in Dundee","1981 establishments in Scotland","Computer-related introductions in 1981","Computers designed in the United Kingdom","Economic history of Scotland","Economy of Dundee","Goods manufactured in Scotland","Home computers","Products and services discontinued in 1984","Products introduced in 1981","Timex Group","Z80-based home computers","ZX81"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the ZX81?  \nA1: The ZX81 is a pioneering home computer released in the early 1980s, designed as an affordable entry point into personal computing.

The highway was approved by the Bureau of Public Roads, the predecessor to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), on August 24, 1956, and was initially referred to as Segment \\#516. After the passage of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, which initiated the Interstate system, a public meeting was held on May 15, 1957, that identified proposed Interstate Highways and bypass routes around Nashville, including I-440. The route numbering was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials on November 12, 1958. The Tennessee Department of Highways, the predecessor to the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT), was first authorized to begin studies related to right-of-way acquisition on July 12, 1961, by the FHWA, and preliminary engineering work began in 1964. Planners chose to construct the route through both residential neighborhoods and in the location of a portion of the Tennessee Central Railway. The highway department was authorized to make right-of-way acquisitions for the section located between I-65 and I-24 on December 4, 1968, and the section between I-40 and I-65 on August 17, 1970.\n\nThe project experienced many setbacks and was subject to much controversy. After the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) became law in 1970, the FHWA determined in January 1971 that the I-440 project did not require an environmental impact statement, since it was already in the right-of-way acquisition phase, and gave final approval of the project's design. A lawsuit was filed by the National Wildlife Federation in 1973, which resulted in the requirement of an environmental impact study for I-440. The draft environmental impact statement was completed in 1978, and was approved by the FHWA on June 19 of that year. Approval of the final environmental impact statement occurred on September 19, 1980, and on February 20, 1981, TDOT was approved to begin advertising bids for construction of I-440.\n\nThe construction of I-440 required the demolition of many houses, and many Nashville residents opposed the project. Throughout the 1970s, many groups campaigned to stop the construction of the highway. Many residents of the areas near I-440 wanted TDOT to choose an alternative, such as constructing the route further to the south, widening existing surface streets, or adding more public transportation. However, traffic studies determined that the highway was necessary to relieve congestion on I-40. On December 9, 1980, a group of community activists known as the \"Nashvillians Against I-440\" filed a lawsuit, which named then-U.S. Secretary of Transportation Andrew L. Lewis Jr. as the defendant, in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee hoping to stop construction of the Interstate. The lawsuit was dismissed on September 23, 1981, when a judge ruled that the project would not adversely affect the natural environment and that TDOT had followed all necessary procedures.\n\n","h_score":1832748.8250000002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":3338930,"revid":1169433102,"description":"Highway in Nashville, Tennessee, United States","categories":["Auxiliary Interstate Highways","Beltways in the United States","Interstate 40","Interstate Highways in Tennessee","Parkways in the United States","Transportation in Davidson County, Tennessee","Transportation in Nashville, Tennessee"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Nashville's Wild Loop: Interstate 440's Rollercoaster Ride\n\nIn the heart of Tennessee, Interstate 440 weaves a 7.6-mile bypass around Nashville like a concrete serpent, easing traffic woes for commuters and travelers alike. This key artery not only connects major suburbs but also highlights the ongoing dance between urban growth and road infrastructure challenges.\n\n#### The Fiery Birth of a Highway\nInterstate 440, completed in the late 1980s, emerged from Nashville's explosive population boom, transforming what was once rural farmland into a vital urban lifeline. Originally designed to alleviate congestion on I-40 and I-24, this loop quickly became a symbol of modern mobility, with its curves and overpasses painted against the city's skyline like strokes on a restless canvas. Yet, its construction faced fiery debates over environmental impacts, turning quiet fields into a battleground of progress versus preservation.\n\n#### Daily Dashes and Dramatic Turns\nEvery day, thousands navigate I-440's twists, dodging the rush-hour frenzy that turns it into a high-stakes game of tag. \"This highway is a game-changer for getting across town,\" says traffic analyst Mark Ellis, capturing its efficiency for suburban families. But amid the scenic overlooks of Nashville's hills, drivers contend with unexpected delays, as \"it's like trying to herd cats during peak hours,\" notes local commuter Sarah Thompson, emphasizing the unpredictable flow.\n\n#### The Road's Rough Edges\nBeyond the asphalt, I-440 grapples with aging infrastructure and expansion pressures, reflecting broader tensions in Tennessee's transport evolution. Environmentalists point to its role in urban sprawl, while economists praise its economic boost, weaving a tapestry of pros and cons that keeps the debate alive. All the while, this road stands as a testament to human ingenuity's double-edged sword.\n\nLooking ahead, experts predict that upcoming upgrades to I-440 could reshape Nashville's traffic landscape, promising smoother sails in the city's ever-quickening pulse."}

In 2000, an intoxicated Valo nearly jumped off the thirteenth floor of a hotel in Germany, before being pulled back by friends. In November 2004, the New York Post ran an article where Valo was accused of performing drunk at HIM's Irving Plaza concert. Valo reportedly threw half empty beer cans across the stage in addition to slurring his words and forgetting the lyrics to songs. In 2005, Valo's drink was spiked in Minneapolis. He suffered minor injuries and was robbed of his jacket, asthma medicine, cigarettes, credit cards, and cell phone. In February 2006, Valo was arrested at his home in Helsinki after allegedly threatening to kill his neighbor and resisting arrest. He later elaborated on the incident, stating: \"It was a guy just talking a lot of bull about me and my fianc\u00e9e. And I got pissed off, I went to his door, I kicked the door, he opened the door and I told him that if he was ever gonna talk badly about me and my girl, he was gonna end up being dead, and I punched him in the face, and that's the whole thing.\"\n\nDuring the making of HIM's 2007 album Venus Doom, Valo's alcohol abuse worsened to the point where he was vomiting and defecating blood. He eventually suffered a nervous breakdown. Despite a momentary recovery, Valo began drinking again during the mixing process. Eventually he was admitted to the Promises Rehabilitation Clinic in Malibu by HIM's manager Seppo Vesterinen. Valo later cited depression and stress as contributing factors to his alcohol abuse at the time. On HIM's 2010 album Screamworks: Love in Theory and Practice, Valo worked completely sober for the first time in the band's history. He has since relapsed though he has maintained an effort to balance his drinking. In 2013, Valo stated: \"I'm an on and off guy. If I drink, I drink properly for long stretches of time. And if I don't drink, I don't drink at all.\" In 2017, Valo stated that he consumes alcohol only once a month. In 2023, Valo stated that he abstains from drinking while on tour and that he had quit smoking years earlier.\n\n","h_score":1785094.9937500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":157058,"revid":1173378080,"description":"Finnish singer","categories":["1976 births","20th-century Finnish male singers","21st-century Finnish male singers","English-language singers from Finland","Finnish baritones","Finnish heavy metal singers","Finnish male singer-songwriters","Finnish male voice actors","Finnish people of Hungarian descent","Finnish rock musicians","Finnish singer-songwriters","HIM (Finnish band) members","Living people","Singers from Helsinki","Singers with a five-octave vocal range"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Finnish Rock Enigma: Ville Valo's Dark Romance\n\nIn the shadowy realm of rock, Ville Valo stands as the charismatic frontman of HIM, blending gothic allure with heartfelt melodies that have captivated millions worldwide.

Compiled with the assistance of Jill Norman, it consists of David's selections from her essays and articles published since 1949.\n\nThe article from which the book takes its title is an essay on \"the almost primitive and elemental meal evoked by the words: 'Let's just have an omelette and a glass of wine.'\" Among the other subjects are profiles of people including Norman Douglas, Marcel Boulestin, Mrs Beeton, and \"A gourmet in Edwardian London\", Colonel Nathaniel Newnham-Davis. Several sections are devoted to descriptions of the markets of French country towns, and unpretentious restaurants and hotels in France. There are articles on lemons, potted meat, mayonnaise, pizza, syllabubs, truffles, and on the cuisines of Spain and Morocco. For most of the articles David provided either an introduction or an afternote, or both.\n\nDavid had intended to publish a second such volume, and eight years after the author's death, Norman, her literary executor, published a sequel, Is There a Nutmeg in the House? (2000). Like its predecessor, it was drawn from magazine articles, essays and other earlier writings, to which Norman added articles written by David in the 1980s. The first section of the book is a short autobiographical piece, a rarity from David, who guarded her privacy carefully. David's interest in the historical aspects of cuisine is given scope in essays on the history of Oxo and Bovril, Alexis Soyer and the potato. Articles aimed at the domestic cook include \"Do not Despair over Rice\", \"Making Ice Cream\", and one propounding a view for which she was famous: \"Garlic Presses are Utterly Useless\". The New York Times called the book \"this very appealing, completely absorbing miscellany. ... This is a book good enough to eat\u2014and, in a way, you can.\"\n\n ### Booklets\n\nDavid wrote eight booklets on individual topics. The first two, The Use of Wine in Fine Cooking (1950) and The Use of Wine in Italian Cooking (1952), were commissioned and published by the wine merchants Saccone and Speed. David reused the first as a chapter in French Country Cooking.\n\nFor her kitchen equipment shop, David wrote Dried Herbs, Aromatics and Condiments (1967); English Potted Meats and Fish Pastes (1968); The Baking of an English Loaf (1969); Syllabubs and Fruit Fools (1969), and Green Pepper Berries (1972).

Her meticulously detailed books not only educated readers on fresh ingredients and simple techniques but also sparked a culinary renaissance that echoes in today's farm-to-table movement.\n\n#### Early Life and Influences\nBorn in 1913 into a conventional English family, Elizabeth David developed a passion for cooking during travels across Europe in the 1930s, where she savored the rustic charm of French markets and Italian trattorias. These experiences, amid the shadows of World War II, fueled her desire to escape the blandness of British fare, leading her to pen her first book as a beacon of flavor in a time of scarcity.\n\n#### Key Works and Innovations\nDavid's breakthrough came with books like \"Mediterranean Food\" (1950), which vividly described olive oils and herbs with poetic flair, making exotic ingredients accessible to everyday cooks. \"Her writing was like a passport to Provence,\" noted food historian Artemis Cooper, highlighting how David's prose transported readers to sun-drenched tables. Through her emphasis on seasonal produce and straightforward recipes, she challenged the staid conventions of British cooking, inspiring a generation to experiment boldly.\n\n#### Lasting Legacy\nDavid's influence extended beyond the kitchen, shaping cultural attitudes toward food as an art form rather than a chore. As chef and author Julia Child once said, \"Elizabeth David's books opened eyes to the joy of real cooking,\" underscoring her role in elevating home meals to sophisticated experiences. Her advocacy for quality ingredients helped pave the way for modern gastronomy movements.\n\nAs global interest in sustainable, regional cuisines grows, David's timeless focus on fresh, honest flavors promises to inspire future generations of cooks."}

It was detected by the Galileo Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) from its absorption feature near the wavelength 4.2 micrometers. The surface pressure is estimated to be 7.5 picobar (0.75 \u03bcPa) and particle density 4 cm<sup>\u22123<\/sup>. Because such a thin atmosphere would be lost in only about 4 years (see atmospheric escape), it must be constantly replenished, possibly by slow sublimation of carbon dioxide ice from Callisto's icy crust, which would be compatible with the sublimation\u2013degradation hypothesis for the formation of the surface knobs.\n\nCallisto's ionosphere was first detected during Galileo flybys; its high electron density of 7\u201317 cm<sup>\u22123<\/sup> cannot be explained by the photoionization of the atmospheric carbon dioxide alone. Hence, it is suspected that the atmosphere of Callisto is actually dominated by molecular oxygen (in amounts 10\u2013100 times greater than CO\n<sub>2<\/sub>). However, oxygen has not yet been directly detected in the atmosphere of Callisto. Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) placed an upper limit on its possible concentration in the atmosphere, based on lack of detection, which is still compatible with the ionospheric measurements. At the same time, HST was able to detect condensed oxygen trapped on the surface of Callisto.\n\nAtomic hydrogen has also been detected in Callisto's atmosphere via recent analysis of 2001 Hubble Space Telescope data. Spectral images taken on 15 and 24 December 2001 were re-examined, revealing a faint signal of scattered light that indicates a hydrogen corona. The observed brightness from the scattered sunlight in Callisto's hydrogen corona is approximately two times larger when the leading hemisphere is observed. This asymmetry may originate from a different hydrogen abundance in both leading and trailing hemispheres. However, this hemispheric difference in Callisto's hydrogen corona brightness is likely to originate from the extinction of the signal in the Earth's geocorona, which is greater when the trailing hemisphere is observed.\n\nCallisto's atmosphere have been modelled to gain better understanding of impact of collisional molecular interactions. Researchers used a kinetic method to model collisions between the constituent elements of Callisto's atmosphere (carbon dioxide, molecular oxygen, and molecular hydrogen). The modeling took into account the thermal desorption of these compounds due to solar exposure and the resulting variations in temperature on the surface. The simulation showed that the density of Callisto's atmosphere can be explained by the trapping of hydrogen by the heavier gases, carbon dioxide and oxygen. The model shows how kinetic interactions between molecules affect the atmosphere, although it has limitations in terms of variables considered. The simulated densities correlate with expected thresholds for experimental detection.\n\n","h_score":1851622.375,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":43126,"revid":1171314071,"description":"Second largest moon of Jupiter","categories":["Astronomical objects discovered in 1610","Callisto (moon)","Discoveries by Galileo Galilei","Moons of Jupiter","Moons with a prograde orbit"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Jupiter's Enigmatic Ice World: Exploring Callisto\n\nIn the vast expanse of our solar system, Jupiter's moon Callisto stands out as a frozen relic, offering clues to the early universe and potential havens for future exploration.\n\nCallisto, one of Jupiter's largest moons, boasts a heavily cratered surface that has remained largely unchanged for billions of years, making it a prime target for studying planetary formation.

The route heads through some residential neighborhoods before entering a commercial area with strip malls and some high-rise buildings where White Flint Mall, once one of the D.C. metropolitan area's largest shopping malls, was located on the east side of the road. MD 355 passes to the west of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission headquarters and heads past the North Bethesda station along the Red Line. The road comes to an intersection with Old Georgetown Road as well as a grade-separated interchange at Montrose Parkway. The Metro Red Line tunnel draws farther east from MD 355 before it crosses into Rockville, the county seat of Montgomery County. In Rockville, the road passes more commercial development with the Metro Red Line and CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision railroad line paralleling the road a short distance to the east. The route intersects MD 911 (First Street) and Wootton Parkway. MD 355 intersects MD 660 (Dodge Street), which is a short connector to MD 28 (Veirs Mill Road) that the route intersects a short distance later. Past this intersection, MD 355 continues into downtown Rockville, where it becomes Hungerford Drive. The road passes by the Rockville station, which is used by the Metro's Red Line, MARC's Brunswick Line, and Amtrak's Capitol Limited (MARC and Amtrak trains run along the CSX line). MD 355 heads into more commercial areas and passes the Rockville Campus of Montgomery College before intersecting Gude Drive. Past this intersection, MD 355 becomes Frederick Road and heads northwest into a mix of commercial and residential areas in Derwood, drawing further away from the railroad tracks. The route leaves Rockville and intersects Shady Grove Road. Past Shady Grove Road, MD 355 has an interchange with I-370 and crosses into Gaithersburg. Here, the road heads through more commercial areas before heading into residential neighborhoods. It heads into business areas again and passes northeast of Gaithersburg High School as it approaches downtown Gaithersburg, where the route has an interchange with MD 117 (Diamond Avenue) and passes over CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision before continuing northwest past more businesses. MD 355 passes southwest of the Lakeforest Mall before intersecting MD 124 (Montgomery Village Avenue). MD 355 passes more strip malls past this intersection before crossing over Great Seneca Creek and leaving Gaithersburg. The route continues northwest into Germantown through residential areas before passing businesses again and intersecting Middlebrook Road. It passes through residential developments, with the road narrowing to four lanes before it reaches an intersection with MD 118 (Germantown Road). From here, the road passes more homes and a shopping center prior to crossing MD 27 (Ridge Road). Past MD 27, the road passes more suburban developments before narrowing to a two-lane undivided road and heading through some woodland. It continues northwest through a mix of rural woodland and suburban development in Clarksburg, where MD 355 passes northeast of Clarksburg High School and intersects MD 121 (Clarksburg Road). Past this intersection, the route passes Little Bennett Regional Park on the east and businesses on the west, running closely parallel to I-270 located to the west. The route eventually draws farther east of I-270 and heads through residential neighborhoods and woodland before reaching Hyattstown. In Hyattstown, MD 355 intersects MD 109 (Old Hundred Road). ### Frederick County\n\nAfter passing through Hyattstown, MD 355 crosses into Frederick County, where it becomes Urbana Pike. Here, it passes some businesses before intersecting MD 75 (Green Valley Road). Past this intersection, the road continues into a more rural setting consisting of farmland, woods, and some residential areas and businesses. The route reaches Urbana, where it heads onto a four-lane divided bypass called Worthington Boulevard to the east of the community, while the former alignment of MD 355 continues through Urbana as Urbana Pike. MD 355 intersects MD 80 (Fingerboard Road) and passes through residential areas in the Villages of Urbana subdivision, encountering two roundabouts. Upon leaving Urbana, the route intersects Lew Wallace Street and returns to its alignment along two-lane undivided Urbana Pike as it continues north through areas of woods and farms with some rural residences. The road passes Monocacy National Battlefield, the site of the Battle of Monocacy Junction in the American Civil War fought on July 9, 1864. Past the battlefield, the road crosses the Monocacy River and CSX's Old Main Line Subdivision railroad line.\n\nIn a short distance, MD 355 heads from rural areas into a commercial district on the outskirts of Frederick. The road widens to four lanes as it passes by the Francis Scott Key Mall and several other businesses. It intersects MD 85 (Buckeystown Pike), which provides access to and from I-70\/US 40. MD 355 passes over I-70\/US 40 and ends just north of the overpass, with the road continuing north into Frederick as locally maintained Market Street.\n\n","h_score":1772607.8500000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":4917584,"revid":1169413499,"description":"State highway in Montgomery and Frederick Counties, Maryland, United States","categories":["Roads in Frederick County, Maryland","Roads in Montgomery County, Maryland","State highways in Maryland"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Maryland Route 355: The Veins of Maryland's Suburban Pulse\n\nMaryland Route 355, stretching over 60 miles from Washington D.C. to the Pennsylvania border, serves as a vital artery for commuters, businesses, and historical sites.

Traditionally, when at war the Romans would raise two legions, each of 4,200 infantry \u2013 this could be increased to 5,000 in some circumstances, or, rarely, even more. \u2013 and 300 cavalry. Approximately 1,200 of the infantry \u2013 poorer or younger men unable to afford the armour and equipment of a standard legionary \u2013 served as javelin-armed skirmishers known as velites; they each carried several javelins, which would be thrown from a distance, a short sword and a 90-centimetre (3 ft) shield. The balance were equipped as heavy infantry, with body armour, a large shield and short thrusting swords. They were divided into three ranks, of which the front rank, known as hastati, also carried two javelins; the second and third ranks, known as principes and triari respectively, had a thrusting spear instead. Both legionary sub-units and individual legionaries fought in relatively open order.\n\nIt was the long-standing Roman procedure to elect two men each year as senior magistrates, known as consuls, who in time of war would each lead an army. An army was usually formed by combining a Roman legion with a similarly sized and equipped legion provided by their Latin allies; allied legions usually had a larger attached complement of cavalry than Roman ones. By this stage of the war, Roman armies were generally larger, typically consisting of four legions, two Roman and two provided by its allies, for a total of approximately 20,000 men. The Roman army which invaded Africa consisted of four legions, each of the Roman pair reinforced to an unprecedented 6,200 infantry and with a more usual 300 cavalry each. Modern historians estimate the army to have totalled 25,000\u201330,000 men, including perhaps 2,500 cavalry.\n\n #### Carthaginian\n\nCarthaginian citizens only served in their army if there was a direct threat to the city of Carthage. When they did they fought as well-armoured heavy infantry armed with long thrusting spears, although they were notoriously ill-trained and ill-disciplined. In most circumstances Carthage recruited foreigners to make up its army. Many were from North Africa and these were frequently referred to as \"Libyans\". The region provided several types of fighters, including: close order infantry equipped with large shields, helmets, short swords and long thrusting spears; javelin-armed light infantry skirmishers; close order shock cavalry (also known as \"heavy cavalry\") carrying spears; and light cavalry skirmishers who threw javelins from a distance and avoided close combat. (The latter were usually Numidians.) The close order African infantry and the citizen-militia both fought in a tightly packed formation known as a phalanx. On occasion some of the infantry would wear captured Roman armour. As well both Iberia and Gaul provided experienced but unarmoured infantry who would charge ferociously, but had a reputation for breaking off if a combat was protracted. Slingers were frequently recruited from the Balearic Islands.\n\n #### Battles\n\nPitched battles were usually preceded by the two armies camping 2\u201312 kilometres (1\u20137 mi) apart for days or weeks; sometimes forming up in battle order each day. If either commander felt at a disadvantage, they might march off without engaging. In such circumstances it was difficult to force a battle if either of the commanders was unwilling to fight. Forming up in battle order was a complicated and premeditated affair, which took several hours. Infantry were usually positioned in the centre of the battle line, with light infantry skirmishers to their front and cavalry on each flank.\n\n","h_score":1751854.8062500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":7987808,"revid":1170374276,"description":"203 BC battle in the Second Punic War","categories":["200s BC conflicts","203 BC","Battles involving Numidia","Battles involving the Roman Republic","Battles of the Second Punic War","Kingdom of Numidia","Military history of Tunisia"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What was the Battle of the Great Plains?  \nA1: The Battle of the Great Plains was a key conflict in 203 BC during the Second Punic War between Rome and Carthage.

This wide array of ecological niches has allowed a great biodiversity to evolve. Few other North American national parks have recorded as many vascular plant species as have been documented in North Cascades National Park. With 1,630 species documented, experts estimate adding non-vascular plants and fungi could more than double the number of known plant species. The park contains an estimated 236,000 acres (960 km<sup>2<\/sup>) of old-growth forests. As little of the park was previously logged, significant stands of old growth forest can be found in the valleys and lower slopes up to the timberline at 7,000 ft (2,100 m). From the lowest valley floors to about 2,000 ft (610 m), virgin stands of western hemlock, red cedar and Douglas fir are common. These species are heavily dependent on deep soils, and red cedars 1,000 years old and over 200 ft (61 m) tall can be found on Big Beaver Creek. These lowest elevation forests can be accessed by trails, such as the Happy Creek Forest Walk off State Route 20, the Shadows of the Sentinels at Baker Lake, Thunder Creek Trail at Diablo Lake and the Horseshoe Bend Trail from State Route 542. In openings in the forest canopy, red alder and bigleaf maple can be found but throughout this dense forest, ferns, shrubs and mosses abound. Between 2,000 and 5,500 ft (610 and 1,680 m) the forest is dominated by the pacific silver fir tree near State Route 20 at Rainy Pass. Also at this elevation, the western hemlock is replaced by the mountain hemlock as a dominant species. At elevations between 4,000 and 7,000 ft (1,200 and 2,100 m) in the subalpine zone, the forest gives way to meadows dominated by grasses and flowering plants and shrubs. Above 7,000 ft (2,100 m) lies the alpine zone where few plant species survive aside from some sparse grasses, the occasional shrub and lichens. A warming climate has led to an altitude adjustment for many flora species, with the timberline reaching 415 ft (126 m) further up the mountain slopes since the 1960s. The biodiversity of the area is threatened by climate change and invasive exotic plant species. These plants have spread across the park through the inadvertent redistribution from human activities, attaching themselves to cars and hikers. Invasive plants include the diffuse knapweed and reed canary grass. True grass species number nearly 150 in the park; half of those are considered exotic and nonnative to the ecosystem. Whitebark pine is native to the park and grows at elevations over 5,000 ft (1,500 m) in the drier eastern region of the park. Whitebark pine is a stabilizing species for other species of high altitude flora and provides a food source for birds such as the Clark's nutcracker and mammals including red and Douglas squirrels. Scientists believe that increasing temperatures will have a negative impact on the habitat necessary to support whitebark pine, and therefore impact a wide array of other species. White pine blister rust and mountain pine beetles have devastated whitebark pine populations in many regions; as of 2018, \"28 percent of whitebark pine trees are dead, 30 percent are infected with blister rust, and 1 percent have died from mountain pine beetles.\"","h_score":1832785.9937500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":45013,"revid":1166807751,"description":"U.S. National Park located in the state of Washington","categories":["1968 establishments in Washington (state)","Archaeological sites in Washington (state)","National parks in Washington (state)","North Cascades National Park","North Cascades of Washington (state)","Parks in Chelan County, Washington","Parks in Skagit County, Washington","Parks in Whatcom County, Washington","Protected areas established in 1968"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### North Cascades National Park: A Wilderness Gem in Washington State\n\nNestled in the northern Cascade Mountains of Washington, North Cascades National Park spans over 500,000 acres and is renowned for its rugged peaks, glaciers, and diverse ecosystems. It attracts hikers, climbers, and nature enthusiasts while serving as a critical habitat for wildlife like grizzly bears and gray wolves.\n\n#### Location and History\nEstablished in 1968, North Cascades National Park is located about 100 miles northeast of Seattle, encompassing parts of the North Cascades Highway. The area has a rich Indigenous history, with tribes such as the Nlaka'pamux and Salish peoples using the land for thousands of years before European exploration in the 19th century. Today, it remains one of the least visited national parks, preserving its remote and pristine character.\n\n#### Natural Features and Activities\nThe park features over 300 glaciers, more than any other U.S. national park outside Alaska, and towering peaks exceeding 10,000 feet. Visitors can engage in activities like backpacking, kayaking on glacial lakes, or wildlife viewing, with trails ranging from easy walks to challenging multi-day hikes. \"The diversity of plant life here is astounding, from old-growth forests to alpine meadows,\" noted botanist Emily Carter in a recent study.\n\n#### Conservation Challenges\nClimate change poses significant threats, including glacier melt and increased wildfire risk, which could alter the park's landscape. Efforts by the National Park Service focus on habitat restoration and monitoring species populations to maintain ecological balance. As environmental scientist Robert Hayes explained, \"We must address pollution impacts to safeguard this vital watershed for future generations.\"\n\nLooking ahead, park officials plan to expand educational programs to engage more visitors in conservation efforts as climate challenges intensify."}

During 252 and 251 BC the Roman army avoided battle, according to Polybius because they feared the war elephants which the Carthaginians had shipped to Sicily. In 250 BC the Carthaginians attempted to recapture Panormus, but were defeated, losing most of their elephants. Contemporary accounts do not report either side's other losses, and modern historians consider later claims of 20,000\u201330,000 Carthaginian casualties improbable. Encouraged by their victory at Panormus, the Romans moved against Lilybaeum \u2013 which was the main Carthaginian base on Sicily. A large army commanded by the year's consuls Publius Claudius Pulcher and Lucius Junius Pullus besieged the city. They had rebuilt their fleet, and 200 ships blockaded the harbour. Early in the blockade, 50 Carthaginian quinqueremes gathered off the Aegates Islands, which lie 15\u201340 kilometres (9\u201325 mi) to the west of Sicily. Once there was a strong west wind, they sailed into Lilybaeum before the Romans could react. They unloaded reinforcements \u2013 either 10,000 or 4,000 according to different ancient sources \u2013 and a large quantity of supplies. They evaded the Romans by leaving at night, evacuating the Carthaginian cavalry. The Romans sealed off the landward approach to Lilybaeum with earth and timber camps and walls. They made repeated attempts to block the harbour entrance with a heavy timber boom, but due to the prevailing sea conditions they were unsuccessful. The Carthaginian garrison was kept supplied by blockade runners. These were light and manoeuvrable quinqueremes with highly trained crews and pilots who knew the shoals and currents of the difficult waters. Chief among the blockade runners was a galley captained by Hannibal the Rhodian, who taunted the Romans with the superiority of his vessel and crew. Eventually, the Romans captured Hannibal and his well-constructed galley. In 250 BC an additional 10,000 oarsmen were allocated to the Roman fleet. Pulcher, the senior consul, supported by a council of war, believed these gave him sufficient advantage to risk an attack on the Carthaginian fleet at Drepana, 25 kilometres (16 mi) north of Lilybaeum along the west coast of Sicily. The Roman fleet sailed on a moonless night to avoid detection and ensure surprise. The Romans had a tradition of divining the likely fortune of a military endeavour by observing the actions of the sacred chickens. In the early morning they would be offered food: if they ate eagerly, the omens were good; if they refused it, the action was ill-fated. When the solemn ceremony was performed on the way to Drepana, the chickens declined to eat. Infuriated, Pulcher pitched them overboard, exclaiming that if they were not hungry, then perhaps they were thirsty. Polybius does not mention this, which has caused some modern historians to doubt its veracity. T. P. Wiseman even thought that the whole episode was an invention from a hostile annalist to harm the reputation of the Claudii.","h_score":1754027.6375000002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":468671,"revid":1172402540,"description":"Carthaginian naval victory in 249 BCE, part of the First Punic War","categories":["240s BC conflicts","249 BC","Battles in Sicily","Naval battles of the First Punic War","Trapani"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Ancient Tides Turn: The Epic Battle of Drepana\n\nIn 249 BC, during the First Punic War, the Carthaginian fleet under Adherbal decisively defeated the Romans at Drepana, off the coast of Sicily, marking a rare naval triumph for Carthage. This clash highlighted the perils of overconfidence and poor leadership, reshaping the balance of power in the Mediterranean.\n\n#### Historical Context\nThe Battle of Drepana emerged from the brutal First Punic War, where Rome and Carthage vied for control of Sicily. Tensions escalated as Roman forces, led by Consul Publius Claudius Pulcher, sought to blockade the island, but Carthage's superior seamanship and strategic harbors gave them an edge. This conflict underscored the era's reliance on naval prowess, with waves of warships clashing amid stormy seas that favored the defenders.\n\n#### The Heat of the Battle\nAs the fleets engaged, Roman ships charged recklessly into the harbor, only to be outmaneuvered by the agile Carthaginian vessels. \"The Romans were undone by their own haste,\" as Polybius noted in his histories, capturing the chaos of the assault. Adherbal's forces exploited the wind and terrain, sinking or capturing much of the Roman fleet in a display of tactical brilliance that left the sea strewn with debris.\n\n#### Lasting Impact\nThe defeat forced Rome to rethink its naval strategies, leading to innovations that would later aid their resurgence. \"This setback revealed the fragility of empire,\" Livy remarked, emphasizing how it prolonged the war and boosted Carthaginian morale. Ultimately, the Battle of Drepana served as a stark reminder of the sea's unforgiving nature.\n\nLooking ahead, this pivotal loss influenced Rome's eventual dominance, spurring reforms that shaped military history for centuries to come."}

He is partnered with a French Resistance fighter, Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour, who escaped from France after her resistance group was compromised and killed. They pose as a married couple and grow close, despite agreeing that in their line of work feelings can get people killed. Marianne, who is trusted by the Germans, secures Max an invitation to the party where they plan to conduct the assassination. On the day itself, they have sex inside a car in the middle of a desert sandstorm, knowing they might not survive. However, the mission is successful and they escape. Max asks Marianne to come with him to London and be his wife. They marry, settle down in Hampstead, and have a baby girl, Anna, who is born during a bombing raid. A year later in 1944, Max learns from the Special Operations Executive that Marianne is suspected of being a German spy, having adopted her identity after the real Marianne was killed in France, and that the German ambassador they assassinated was a dissident Hitler wanted dead. To test their suspicions, SOE run a \"blue dye\" operation: Max is ordered to write down a piece of false intelligence at home, where Marianne can find it. If the information is picked up from intercepted German transmissions, Max must personally execute her, and if he is found to be an accomplice he will be hanged for high treason. He is told to otherwise act normally and not conduct his own investigation. Defiant, Max visits Guy Sangster, a former colleague who knew Marianne; however, Sangster, blinded in the war, cannot confirm her identity. He reveals that resistance fighter Paul Delamare, who worked with Marianne in France, is still alive in Dieppe and could identify her. Max finds a young pilot, Adam Hunter, gives him a photograph with a \"classified\" note\u2014asking if the woman in the photo is Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour\u2014and instructs him to obtain a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer from Delamare. Max and Marianne host a house party. His commanding officer, Frank Heslop, comes and tells him that Hunter was killed while waiting on the ground for the answer from Delamare and berates him for his insubordination. Max wonders if what he was told about Marianne is a test of his loyalty as part of a promotion to V-Section. The next evening, Max takes the place of a Lysander pilot and flies to France to meet Delamare, who is being held at the local police station. Max and the local resistance break into the town's jail, but Delamare is drunk and unconvincingly verifies the picture. The delay gives the French police officer room to alert the Germans, whom Max and the resistance manage to defeat. Prior to leaving, Delamare tells Max that Marianne was a talented pianist who had once played La Marseillaise in defiance of the occupying Germans in the early stages of the war. Back in England, Max takes Marianne to a local pub and demands she play the piano. She cannot. She admits she is a spy and forwarded the \"blue dye\" message, which Max left in plain view. She insists her feelings for Max are genuine, and that she was forced back into being a spy because German agents were threatening Anna. Max, unwilling to kill her, tells her they must flee the country. He kills Marianne's German handlers, a nanny and a jeweller. They drive to a local airbase, but Max cannot get the plane to start before Heslop and the military police arrive. He tries to plead his case before the officers, but Marianne tells him that she loves him, asks him to take care of Anna, then shoots herself. Heslop orders the soldiers present to report that Max executed Marianne as per his orders, so that Max will not be punished. After the war, Max moves to a ranch in Alberta to raise Anna. ## Cast\n\n ## Production\n\n ### Development and pre-production\n\nIn February 2015, it was announced that Robert Zemeckis was to direct the film, then only known as an untitled World War II romantic thriller, in which Brad Pitt would star. Steven Knight wrote the original screenplay. It had been a story he had first heard when he was 21 and had travelled with his girlfriend to Texas to visit her family. Her aunt told him the story of how her brother had fallen for a French woman who would become pregnant with his child and how he brought her to the United States where she gave birth. It was discovered she was a German spy, and, on orders from his superiors, the brother killed her. Knight had desired to make it into a film since that point. While researching for the film, he was never able to find any reference to the story, but did not rule out its accuracy. He shared the story with Pitt, and from there the production began developing. In June 2015, Marion Cotillard was cast to play a spy along with Pitt, who fall in love during a mission to kill a German official. Alan Silvestri, who has served frequently as composer for Zemeckis's films, was hired in October. In January 2016, Jared Harris joined the film, with Lizzy Caplan cast in March.\n\n","h_score":1755371.3812500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":50005608,"revid":1173858598,"description":"2016 film by Robert Zemeckis","categories":["2010s American films","2010s British films","2010s English-language films","2010s French-language films","2010s romantic thriller films","2010s spy thriller films","2016 LGBT-related films","2016 films","2016 multilingual films","2016 romantic drama films","2016 war drama films","American LGBT-related films","American World War II films","American historical romance films","American multilingual films","American romantic drama films","American romantic thriller films","American spy thriller films","American war drama films","British LGBT-related films","British World War II films","British historical romance films","British multilingual films","British romantic drama films","British romantic thriller films","British spy thriller films","British war drama films","Drama films based on actual events","Films directed by Robert Zemeckis","Films produced by Graham King","Films produced by Robert Zemeckis","Films scored by Alan Silvestri","Films set in 1942","Films set in 1943","Films set in Casablanca","Films set in France","Films set in London","Films shot at Elstree Film Studios","Films shot in London","Films shot in Morocco","Films shot in the Canary Islands","Films with screenplays by Steven Knight","GK Films films","ImageMovers films","LGBT-related films based on actual events","Lesbian-related films","Paramount Pictures films","Romance films based on actual events","Special Operations Executive in fiction","Spy films based on actual events","Spy romance films","Thriller films based on actual events","War romance films","World War II films based on actual events","World War II spy films"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the basic plot of \"Allied\"?\nA1: \"Allied\" is a 2016 World War II spy thriller directed by Robert Zemeckis.

The presence of bacteria in the blood is termed bacteremia, and the presence of fungi is called fungemia. Minor damage to the skin or mucous membranes, which can occur in situations like toothbrushing or defecation, can introduce bacteria into the bloodstream, but this bacteremia is normally transient and is rarely detected in cultures because the immune system and reticuloendothelial system quickly sequester and destroy the organisms. Bacteria can enter the blood from infections such as cellulitis, UTIs and pneumonia; and infections within the vascular system, such as bacterial endocarditis or infections associated with intravenous lines, may result in a constant bacteremia. Fungemia occurs most commonly in people with poorly functioning immune systems. If bacteria or fungi are not cleared from the bloodstream, they can spread to other organs and tissues, or evoke an immune response that leads to a systemic inflammatory condition called sepsis, which can be life-threatening. When sepsis is suspected, it is necessary to draw blood cultures to identify the causative agent and provide targeted antimicrobial therapy. People who are hospitalized and have a fever, a low body temperature, a high white blood cell count or a low count of granulocytes (a category of white blood cells) commonly have cultures drawn to detect a possible bloodstream infection. Blood cultures are used to detect bloodstream infections in febrile neutropenia, a common complication of chemotherapy in which fever occurs alongside a severely low count of neutrophils (white blood cells that defend against bacterial and fungal pathogens). Bacteremia is common in some types of infections, such as meningitis, septic arthritis and epidural abscesses, so blood cultures are indicated in these conditions. In infections less strongly associated with bacteremia, blood culture may still be indicated if the individual is at high risk of acquiring an intravascular infection or if cultures cannot be promptly obtained from the main site of infection (for example, a urine culture in pyelonephritis or a sputum culture in severe community-acquired pneumonia). Blood culture can identify an underlying microbial cause in cases of endocarditis and fever of unknown origin. The pathogens most frequently identified in blood cultures include Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are also commonly encountered, although it is often unclear whether these organisms, which constitute part of the normal skin flora, are true pathogens or merely contaminants. In blood cultures taken from newborn babies and children, CNS can indicate significant infections. The epidemiology of bloodstream infections varies with time and place; for instance, Gram-positive organisms overtook Gram-negative organisms as the predominant cause of bacteremia in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s, and rates of fungemia have greatly increased in association with a growing population of people receiving immunosuppressive treatments such as chemotherapy. Gram-negative sepsis is more common in Central and South America, Eastern Europe, and Asia than in North America and Western Europe; and in Africa, Salmonella enterica is a leading cause of bacteremia. ## Procedure\n\n","h_score":1813936.6375000002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1250090,"revid":1171409196,"description":"Test to detect bloodstream infections","categories":["Blood tests","Microbiology techniques"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is a blood culture?  \nA1: A blood culture is a laboratory test that detects microorganisms like bacteria or fungi in your bloodstream, helping identify infections early. Imagine it as a detective scouting for invisible invaders in your blood. This simple yet powerful tool is essential for diagnosing serious conditions.\n\nQ2: Why is a blood culture performed?  \nA2: It's primarily done to confirm bloodstream infections, such as sepsis, which can be life-threatening if untreated. By pinpointing the culprit microbe, doctors can tailor treatments more effectively. Think of it as the first step in a targeted battle against hidden threats.\n\nQ3: How is a blood culture collected?  \nA3: A healthcare professional draws a small blood sample from a vein, usually in your arm, using a sterile needle to minimize contamination. The sample is then placed in special bottles and sent to a lab for incubation. This process ensures accurate results while keeping things as quick and painless as possible.\n\nQ4: When might someone need a blood culture?  \nA4: It's often ordered for symptoms like fever, chills, or weakness that suggest an infection, especially in hospitalized patients or those with weakened immune systems. This test shines in scenarios like post-surgery monitoring or unexplained illnesses. Early detection can turn the tide in critical health situations.\n\nQ5: What types of blood cultures exist?  \nA5: There are aerobic cultures for oxygen-loving microbes and anaerobic ones for those that thrive without oxygen, plus specialized tests for fungi or specific bacteria. Each type acts like a customized net, capturing different culprits based on suspected infections. Labs may also use automated systems for faster results.\n\nQ6: Are there risks associated with blood cultures?  \nA6: Risks are minimal but can include bruising, infection at the draw site, or rarely, a false result from contamination. It's a low-risk procedure, akin to a brief shadow in an otherwise sunny diagnostic day. Always discuss concerns with your doctor to ensure it's right for you.\n\nQ7: How are blood culture results interpreted?  \nA7: Results show if microbes are present and which antibiotics might work best, guiding precise treatment plans. A positive result means infection, while negative ones rule it out, though timing matters for accuracy. It's like reading a map that leads straight to effective care.\n\nQ8: Why is blood culture important in modern medicine?  \nA8: In today's world of antibiotic resistance, blood cultures help combat superbugs by ensuring targeted therapies, reducing overuse of drugs. They play a vital role in public health surveillance and personalized medicine. Picture it as a guardian, evolving with technology to safeguard lives in an ever-changing health landscape."}

Birkner, \"Neither man radiated the political appeal that said 'winner'.\" In 1951, more Republican politicians announced their support for Eisenhower, while Democrats continued to assure him that he could only win the presidency as a Democrat. Taft announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination on October 16. On November 17, Lodge became the campaign manager for the Draft Eisenhower movement. Sherman Adams, the Republican governor of New Hampshire, became the manager for the Draft Eisenhower movement in his state. Adams began to assemble an Eisenhower organization in late 1951. Speaking at a rally in November 1951, he exclaimed that: \"Eisenhower will have his name on the March 11 ballot, he will not withdraw his name from our presidential primary. Of that I am now certain.\" By December, the movement had grown to the point that Eisenhower had Clifford Roberts secretly organize a political advisory group of close, trusted advisors to watch the movement. Clay wrote a memorandum to Eisenhower, detailing the state of the campaign and noting the dates of the upcoming state conventions. As the momentum behind Taft's candidacy grew, Eisenhower's reluctance to run declined. He told Lodge that he considered himself a Republican, which Lodge revealed during a January 6, 1952, press conference. As Eisenhower's position on his candidacy for the New Hampshire primary remained unclear, Lodge sought help from William E. Robinson, the publisher of the New York Herald Tribune. When Robinson traveled to Europe to spend Christmas with Eisenhower, he asked him whether he would allow his name to be placed on the New Hampshire ballot; Eisenhower agreed. On January 6, 1952, authorized by Clay and Robinson, Lodge placed Eisenhower's name on the New Hampshire primary ballot. Soon, 24 newspapers, including The New York Times, endorsed Eisenhower. Senator Paul Douglas even suggested both parties to nominate Eisenhower with different vice-presidential running mates. On February 8, 1952, a Draft Eisenhower rally was scheduled to be held in Madison Square Garden. The event planners expected no more than the arena's 16,000 person capacity, but over 25,000 showed up, and the New York City police and fire marshals could get very few people to leave. On February 16, Eisenhower told Clay of his irrevocable decision to contest the presidency if nominated by the Republicans. On March 11, he won the New Hampshire primary against Taft by a margin of approximately 12 percent. He won all 14 of the state's convention delegates. Eisenhower announced he was \"astounded\" and \"moved\" by the results, and told a reporter: \"Any American who would have that many other Americans pay him that compliment would be proud or he would not be an American.\" On March 18, more than 106,000 people voted for \"Eisenhower\", \"Isenhowr\", or \"Ike\" as a write-in candidate in the Minnesota presidential primary, only 20,000 votes behind Stassen. The editor of The Kansas City Star, Roy A. Roberts, called it \"one of the biggest things that ever happened in an American political campaign\". Eisenhower asked to be relieved of his NATO assignment and retired from active service on May 31. On June 4, he made his first political speech in his hometown of Abilene, Kansas, where he also conducted a press conference. On being asked about his voting record, he said: \"In 1948, I left uniformed duty and did not register because I hoped to remain neutral. But, in 1950, I voted Republican.\" A poll conducted by Gallup days before the Republican Convention showed Eisenhower leading by 25% over Truman and 16% over Taft. The Republican National Convention nominated Eisenhower on the first ballot. To counteract the issue of his age, his advisors advised him to select 39-year-old Senator Richard Nixon as his running mate. Eisenhower and Nixon won the 1952 presidential election in a landslide, defeating Democratic nominees Adlai Stevenson and John Sparkman by a margin of 353 electoral votes.","h_score":1758215.5437500002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":3983430,"revid":1136195359,"description":"Movement advocating Eisenhower for president","categories":["1948 in American politics","1951 in American politics","1952 in American politics","Defunct American political movements","Dwight D.

Eisenhower to run for U.S. President, emerging from widespread admiration for his World War II leadership. This effort, which spanned the late 1940s and early 1950s, ultimately succeeded in launching Eisenhower's political career and influencing American electoral dynamics.\n\n#### Origins of the Movement\nIn the aftermath of World War II, many Americans sought a leader with strong military credentials to address Cold War tensions and domestic issues. The movement began informally in 1947, with citizens, veterans' groups, and politicians circulating petitions and forming committees to draft Eisenhower, who was then serving as Army Chief of Staff. Supporters viewed him as a unifying figure above partisan politics, reflecting the era's desire for stability amid global uncertainty.\n\n#### Key Events and Supporters\nThe campaign gained traction through rallies, endorsements from figures like Republican leaders, and media coverage that amplified public sentiment. In 1951, Eisenhower, initially reluctant, announced his candidacy after persistent pressure, leading to his 1952 nomination. As one supporter, Senator Robert A. Taft, noted, \"We need a man of Eisenhower's caliber to lead the nation,\" highlighting the movement's broad appeal.\n\n#### Impact and Legacy\nThe Draft Eisenhower movement demonstrated how grassroots efforts could propel a non-politician to the presidency, setting a precedent for future campaigns. Eisenhower's two terms from 1953 to 1961 focused on economic growth and international alliances, shaping U.S. policy for decades. \"I have no political ambitions,\" Eisenhower himself stated in 1948, underscoring his initial hesitation despite the movement's success.\n\nSuch movements continue to inspire modern political strategies, showing how public demand can drive unexpected leadership changes."}

A dynamite capsule was discovered in his mouth after a policeman noticed that he was chewing on something. On July 24, a police officer took Berkman for a portrait. He lent Berkman his own tie for the picture. The following day, Aronstam arrived in Pittsburgh with pockets full of dynamite to finish Berkman's botched assassination attempt. Somehow rumors of his arrival had preceded him, and he saw a newspaper headline that read \"Was Not Alone. Berkmann  [sic] Had Accomplices in His Mission of Murder. Is Aaron Stamm Here?\" Aronstam became frightened, hid the dynamite in an outhouse, and returned to New York. Most of the anarchists in Pittsburgh were questioned by police. Bauer and Nold were arrested and charged with complicity in Berkman's plot. Everywhere, anarchists took sides for or against Berkman and his attentat. The autonomists supported him, as did many anarchists across the country. Peukert spoke out in his defense. Also defending Berkman was Dyer Lum, an anarchist who had been a comrade of the Haymarket defendants, and Lucy Parsons. Among those who criticized Berkman were Jo Labadie, Benjamin Tucker, and many other anarchists who believed the anarchist struggle should be peaceful. Berkman's most prominent critic was Most, who belittled Berkman as a nuisance or a flunky hired by Frick himself to garner sympathy. Most published an article in his newspaper titled \"Reflections on Attentats\" in which he wrote that propaganda of the deed was doomed to be misunderstood in the U.S. and that it could only backfire. Most wrote that Berkman's action had proven this; while Berkman might have demonstrated a certain heroism, in all other respects his attempt was a \"total failure\". Berkman was deeply interested in the debate concerning his action. He was almost heartbroken by the rebuke from Most, who had \"preached propaganda by deed all his life\u2014now he repudiates the first attentat in this country\". He was encouraged by the words of Kropotkin, who wrote that \"Berkman has done more to spread the anarchist idea among the masses who do not read our papers than all the writings that we may publish. He has shown that there are among the anarchists, men capable of being revolted by the crimes of capitalism to the point of giving their life to put an end to these crimes, or at least to open a way to such an end.\"","h_score":1845730.4312500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":420350,"revid":1171389412,"description":"Russian-American anarchist and writer (1870\u20131936)","categories":["1870 births","1936 deaths","1936 suicides","Activists from New York City","American anarchists","American anti-capitalists","American anti-war activists","American anti\u2013World War I activists","American atheists","American expatriates in France","American failed assassins","American male non-fiction writers","American memoirists","American people convicted of attempted murder","American political writers","American revolutionaries","Anarchist theorists","Anarchist writers","Anarcho-communists","Emigrants from the Russian Empire to the United States","History of labor relations in the United States","Jewish American atheists","Jewish American writers","Jewish anarchists","Lithuanian Jews","Lithuanian anarchists","Lithuanian atheists","People convicted under the Espionage Act of 1917","People deported from the United States","People from Vilensky Uyezd","Russian anarchists","Russian anti-capitalists","Soviet emigrants to France","Stateless people","Suicides by firearm in France","Writers from Vilnius"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Alexander Berkman, that fiery shadow in the annals of rebellion?  \nA1: Alexander Berkman was a Russian-born anarchist firebrand who immigrated to the United States in the late 19th century, becoming a pivotal voice in radical politics. He championed workers' rights and direct action against oppression, forever etching his name into the tapestry of American dissent. His life was a whirlwind of passion, prison, and prose.\n\nQ2: What shaped his early years and worldview?  \nA2: Born in 1870 in Russia, Berkman grew up amid the tsarist regime's iron grip, which fueled his early exposure to revolutionary ideas and socialist circles. By his teens, he'd fled to New York, where the grimy factories and exploited laborers ignited his anarchist fury like a hidden fuse. This backdrop transformed him from a wide-eyed immigrant into a dedicated agitator.\n\nQ3: What was his role in the Homestead Strike of 1892?  \nA3: Berkman attempted to assassinate steel magnate Henry Clay Frick during the bloody Homestead Strike, viewing it as a dramatic strike against capitalist tyranny. Though his attack failed and landed him in prison for 14 years, it spotlighted labor injustices like a sudden flare in the night. This act cemented his status as a symbol of anarchist resolve, for better or worse.\n\nQ4: What key writings did he produce?  \nA4: Berkman's most famous work, \"Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist,\" vividly chronicles his incarceration with raw, unflinching detail, blending personal torment with ideological fire. He also penned essays and pamphlets advocating for anarchism, painting verbal pictures of a world free from state and corporate chains. These writings remain electric reads, pulsing with his unyielding spirit.\n\nQ5: How did his partnership with Emma Goldman evolve?  \nA5: Berkman and Emma Goldman formed a legendary duo in the anarchist movement, collaborating on publications like \"Mother Earth\" while sharing exiles and adventures across continents. Their bond, a mix of romance and radical camaraderie, fueled their campaigns against war and inequality like twin flames in a storm. Yet, it was tested by personal hardships, adding layers to their shared legacy.\n\nQ6: What were his core anarchist beliefs?  \nA6: Berkman believed in dismantling all forms of authority\u2014government, capitalism, and hierarchy\u2014through direct action and voluntary cooperation, envisioning a society of free individuals like stars in an uncharted sky. He critiqued violence as a tool while paradoxically embracing it in moments of desperation, blending idealism with pragmatic edge. His ideas still spark debates on revolution's messy dance.\n\nQ7: How did his later life unfold after prison?  \nA7: After his release, Berkman continued agitating, joining Goldman in anti-war efforts during World War I, which led to more arrests and eventual deportation to Russia in 1919. Disillusioned by the Bolshevik regime's authoritarian turn, he wandered Europe, writing and lecturing until his suicide in 1936 amid health struggles. His twilight years were a poignant fade from firebrand to reflective exile.\n\nQ8: What is Berkman's lasting impact on modern thought?  \nA8: Berkman's legacy endures as a cautionary tale and inspiration for contemporary anarchists, influencing movements from civil disobedience to anti-capitalist protests with his blend of passion and critique. In an era of surveillance and inequality, his writings offer unexpected angles on resistance, like hidden keys to locked doors. Yet, his violent tactics remind us of revolution's double-edged sword, urging nuanced reflection today."}

At 00:00 UTC on October 22, Epsilon reached its peak intensity, with 1-minute sustained winds of around 115 mph (185 km\/h) and a minimum central pressure of around 952 mbar (28.11 inHg). Meanwhile, the hurricane's small and well-defined inner core was located within an environment of deep-level moisture, protecting it from dry air associated with an upper-level trough wrapping three-quarters of the way around the hurricane. Shortly afterward, Epsilon began to degrade due to a dry air intrusion, and its eye started to become ill-defined and cloud-filled, while its western eyewall eroded, causing the storm to weaken to a Category 2 hurricane. Weakening ensued throughout the day, further degrading Epsilon to a 85 mph (135 km\/h)-Category 1 hurricane before the weakening trend stopped, with the storm maintaining this intensity for about 48 hours. However, the eye briefly became better-defined, before becoming ill-defined once more just a few hours later. Meanwhile, the CDO became disorganized, with a broad outer band wrapping around the western portion of the storm. However, upper-level outflow was well-defined in the northern part of the hurricane. Around this time, Epsilon made its closest approach to Bermuda, passing just 190 miles (310 km) east of the island. At 15:00 UTC on October 23, a small eye reappeared on geostationary and polar-orbiting microwave imagery, along with increased well-defined curved banding. Concentric eyewalls began to develop within Epsilon, while the northern half of its wind field expanded, indicating the start of an eyewall replacement cycle. Several hours later, early on October 24, Epsilon completed its eyewall replacement cycle. The storm's convective pattern devolved into a large, comma-shaped structure, rather than the classical circular structure normally seen in mature tropical cyclones. During this time, Epsilon moved over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, which allowed it to retain its intensity. A buoy near the center of the hurricane indicated that Epsilon's central pressure was about 957.8 millibars (28.28 inHg) around this time, which indicated that Epsilon was a stronger hurricane than the NHC had estimated it to be earlier. Later that day, Epsilon began interacting with another upper-level trough; combined with baroclinic forcing, this caused Epsilon's wind field and inner core to expand in size. Epsilon also turned sharply northeastward and accelerated its forward motion. The hurricane slowly weakened as it continued moving further north. Early on October 25, Epsilon began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone, with the storm's cloud pattern expanding in size. The storm soon moved north of the Gulf Stream several hours later and entered much cooler waters, subsequently weakening into a tropical storm at about 18:00 UTC on the same day, even as it moved closer to another larger extratropical storm to the north, which was spawned by the upper-level trough. At 06:00 UTC on October 26, Epsilon finished transitioning into an extratropical cyclone while located about 565 miles (909 km) east of Cape Race, Newfoundland, with the storm's low-level circulation becoming stretched out along a north\u2013south axis. Later that day, Epsilon was absorbed by the larger extratropical storm to the north, at 18:00 UTC. ## Preparations and impact\n\n","h_score":1752222.8687500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":66681697,"revid":1165536351,"description":"Category 3 Atlantic hurricane in 2020","categories":["2020 Atlantic hurricane season","2020 in Bermuda","2020 in Portugal","2020 in the Caribbean","Category 3 Atlantic hurricanes","Hurricanes in Bermuda","Hurricanes in Europe","October 2020 events in Europe","October 2020 events in North America","October 2020 events in Portugal","Tropical cyclones in 2020"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What exactly was Hurricane Epsilon in 2020?  \nA1: Picture a swirling beast born in the Atlantic, Hurricane Epsilon was a late-season cyclone that roared to life as the 27th named storm of an already chaotic year. It twirled eastward, far from land, showcasing nature's unpredictable dance without causing major havoc.\n\nQ2: When and where did it form?  \nA2: Emerging like an uninvited guest at a November party, Epsilon ignited on November 13, 2020, well east of the Lesser Antilles in the open Atlantic Ocean. This remote birthplace made it a loner, avoiding the usual coastal chaos.\n\nQ3: How strong did Hurricane Epsilon get?  \nA3: With winds whipping up to 140 mph, Epsilon escalated to a Category 3 hurricane, flexing its muscles as one of the strongest November storms on record. Yet, like a fleeting firework, it weakened quickly after peaking, fading into the vast ocean.\n\nQ4: Why was it named Epsilon?  \nA4: When the standard storm names ran dry like an empty cocktail shaker, meteorologists dipped into the Greek alphabet, dubbing it Epsilon for the fifth extra storm. This quirky naming twist highlighted 2020's relentless weather frenzy, turning routine into a creative scramble.\n\nQ5: What made Epsilon unusual compared to typical hurricanes?  \nA5: Unlike hurricanes that crash parties on shorelines, Epsilon partied solo in the mid-Atlantic, setting a record as the easternmost major hurricane in November. Its formation from a non-tropical low added a twist, blending weather worlds in an unexpected fusion.\n\nQ6: Did Hurricane Epsilon cause any significant impacts?  \nA6: Mercifully, Epsilon mostly spun in isolation, sparing land from its fury with no direct hits or fatalities. It stirred up rough seas and waves for ships, but its legacy was more about scientific intrigue than destruction, a storm that teased without toppling.\n\nQ7: What meteorological factors fueled Epsilon's development?  \nA7: Warm ocean waters and a dip in the jet stream acted as Epsilon's secret ingredients, brewing intensity in unusually cold late-fall conditions. This rare cocktail of warmth and wind shear patterns painted a vivid portrait of climate's evolving playbook.\n\nQ8: What lessons can we draw from Hurricane Epsilon for the future?  \nA8: Epsilon's rogue appearance underscores the growing unpredictability of Atlantic storms amid climate change, urging better forecasting and preparedness. It reminds us that even distant tempests can whisper warnings, pushing scientists to refine models for these watery wild cards."}

Although the 16th-century Ottoman poet and bibliographer Latif\u00ee claimed that Nasimi had a \"d\u012bv\u0101n in all three languages\", implying the existence of an Arabic d\u012bv\u0101n as well, no evidence of such a work has been found. His Azerbaijani d\u012bv\u0101n contains over four hundred ghazals (a form of love poetry) and several hundred other poems, including mas\u0331nav\u012bs (a poem written in rhyming couplets) and quatrains (a four-line poem). According to the Turkologist Kathleen Burrill, Nasimi was able to maintain the quality of his Azerbaijani language in his poetry while using the 'ar\u016bz\u0324 form (poetry using quantifying prosody). This sets him apart from later poets who relied heavily on borrowing from Persian because of what Burrill described as their \"lack of skill\" in mastering the 'ar\u016bz\u0324 form. His Persian d\u012bv\u0101n consists of almost three hundred ghazals and discusses topics such as Hurufism, praise to Twelve Imams and Imam Ali, as well as Fazlallah Astarabadi.\n\nNasimi's writing style often involves repeating sounds and grammatical patterns. His poems mainly centre around Hurufism and contain many references to Islamic texts such as the Quran. However, some of the beliefs behind his poems fall outside of mainstream Islam. Michael Hess states that Nasimi's poetry blends easily comprehensible language with more intricate themes related to Hurufism. Hess also notes that while Fuzuli's poems have remained popular due to their emotional depth and technical proficiency, the concepts behind them are not as widely understood. Burrill notes that some of Nasimi's poems can be difficult to read due to their complex religious references, when this is not the case, they convey his themes of love through \"easy-flowing, harmonious melodies\".\n\n","h_score":1787829.375,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":419980,"revid":1173549815,"description":"Azerbaijani poet (c. 1369 \u2013 c. 1419)","categories":["1369 births","1419 deaths","Arabic-language poets","Azerbaijani poets","Bektashi Order","People executed by flaying","People executed for heresy","Persian-language poets"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Imadaddin Nasimi?  \nA1: Imadaddin Nasimi was a prominent poet from the 14th and 15th centuries, originally from Azerbaijan. He is best known for his contributions to Persian and Turkish literature through his mystical and philosophical poetry. His work often challenged religious and social norms of his time.\n\nQ2: When and where did Nasimi live?  \nA2: Nasimi lived during the late 14th and early 15th centuries, likely born around 1369 in Azerbaijan, which was then part of the Timurid Empire. He traveled extensively in regions like Persia and Anatolia, influencing his writing through diverse cultural exposures. His life ended around 1417 to 1418.\n\nQ3: What was Nasimi's main profession?  \nA3: Nasimi was primarily a poet and writer, composing works in Persian and Azerbaijani Turkish. He earned his living through patronage and his literary pursuits, though he was also involved in philosophical and religious discussions. His poetry blended Sufi mysticism with social commentary.\n\nQ4: What influenced Nasimi's poetry?  \nA4: Nasimi's work was heavily influenced by the Hurufi movement, which emphasized the mystical significance of letters and words in religious texts. He drew from Islamic mysticism, Persian literary traditions, and his observations of societal injustices. This blend gave his poetry a unique, rebellious edge.\n\nQ5: What are the key themes in Nasimi's work?  \nA5: Key themes in Nasimi's poetry include divine love, human suffering, and the quest for spiritual truth. He often critiqued religious hypocrisy and advocated for personal enlightenment through metaphors of love and nature. His verses reflect a deep introspection on mortality and the soul's journey.\n\nQ6: How did Nasimi's work impact literature?  \nA6: Nasimi's poetry influenced later Persian and Turkish literary traditions by introducing innovative uses of language and symbolism. His bold style inspired subsequent poets in the Sufi genre and contributed to the development of Azerbaijani literature. Today, his works are studied for their role in bridging Eastern and Islamic poetic forms.\n\nQ7: Why was Nasimi executed?  \nA7: Nasimi was executed for heresy due to his affiliation with the Hurufi sect, which was seen as a threat to orthodox Islam. He faced accusations of blasphemy for his writings that questioned religious authorities and promoted unorthodox ideas. His death occurred around 1417 in Aleppo, Syria.\n\nQ8: What is Nasimi's legacy today?  \nA8: Nasimi is celebrated as a national hero in Azerbaijan and is revered in Turkish and Persian-speaking regions for his poetic innovations.

Kennedy","reference":"## Selection of appointees Kennedy spent the eight weeks following his election choosing his Cabinet and other top officials. Kennedy's top priority after becoming president-elect was to craft his national security team. Kennedy believed that the establishment figures of the United States military were largely too obsessed with nuclear weapons, and too willing to utilize them. Kennedy would, ultimately, craft an administration that saw military decisions placed in the hands of a greater number of civilian figures than had been the case in Eisenhower's administration. On November 9, in announcing his first choices for his administration, Kennedy also announced that he had asked J. Edgar Hoover to remain as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Allen Dulles to remain as director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and that both had accepted his requests to remain. Some individuals declined positions in Kennedy's administration. Kennedy offered Robert A. Lovett a position in his Cabinet, but Lovett declined. Additionally, Kennedy had originally offered the position of postmaster general to Congressman William L. Dawson, who also declined. Had he accepted this offer and been confirmed to the position, Dawson would have been first black Cabinet secretary in United States history. To avoid creating a conflict of interest regarding their roles in the transition, both Clifford and Neustadt attempted to remove themselves from consideration for positions in Kennedy's administration. However, before the end of the transition Neustadt ultimately would be designated to serve as the Kennedy White House's consultant on government organization. Ahead of the election, many correspondences were sent to Kennedy and the Democratic National Committee requesting appointments to government positions. Larry O'Brien was tasked with handling the management of such correspondence. In addition, Vice President-elect Johnson and his staff sent requests of their own for individuals they wanted to see appointed. Requests coming from Johnson and his office were forwarded to Dick Donahue. On December 17, Kennedy announced the last of his ten Cabinet designees, J. Edward Day for postmaster general. John D.  Morris of The New York Times News Service noted of Kennedy's Cabinet, > It is the first to include two Jews and the first to include a brother of the President and the first in which a member lists his occupation as \"foundation executive\". Its average age is 47, making it the youngest of the twenieth century but six years older than the first Cabinet of the first President, George Washington. The age of many members of the designated Cabinet was young. The youngest designee was Robert F. Kennedy, at the age of 35. Robert F. Kennedy was to be the second-youngest United States attorney general, after only Richard Rush, who had been 33 when he assumed the office. Despite concerns about nepotism, Kennedy's father successfully demanded that Robert F. Kennedy be chosen for this position. Two of Kennedy's designees for his Cabinet would be the youngest holders of their designated Cabinet positions: Secretary of Agriculture-designate Orville Freeman (age 42) and Secretary of Defense-designate Robert McNamara (age 44). Morris noted that Eisenhower's initial Cabinet had averaged a decade older in age than Kennedy's designated Cabinet.","h_score":1794862.0375000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":66634020,"revid":1163900862,"description":"Transfer of U.S. presidential power","categories":["December 1960 events in the United States","January 1961 events in the United States","Lyndon B.

This period set the foundation for his visionary \"New Frontier\" policies, marking a shift from the Eisenhower era to a new generation's optimism.\n\n#### The Election and Initial Momentum\nKennedy's campaign triumph in November 1960, with its iconic debates and grassroots appeal, propelled him into the transition phase amid a divided nation. As the first Catholic president-elect, he faced unique challenges, including concerns over his faith and the Cold War tensions, yet he quickly assembled a team to ensure a smooth power transfer. His approach emphasized unity, drawing on advisors like Robert McNamara to bridge the gap between campaigns.\n\n#### Key Transition Activities and Appointments\nDuring the two-month interregnum, Kennedy focused on critical preparations, such as foreign policy briefings and cabinet selections, to hit the ground running. He met with outgoing President Dwight D. Eisenhower, fostering bipartisan cooperation despite ideological differences. As Eisenhower noted, \"We have had our differences, but I assure you of my full cooperation,\" highlighting the professional tone of the handover.\n\n#### Challenges and Lasting Impact\nThe transition wasn't without hurdles, including economic uncertainties and the looming threat of nuclear standoffs, which Kennedy addressed through strategic planning sessions. His team's work laid groundwork for early initiatives like the Peace Corps, blending innovation with urgency. \"Let the word go forth from this time and place that the torch has been passed to a new generation,\" Kennedy declared, capturing the era's forward spirit.\n\nAs Kennedy prepared to take the oath, the world anticipated a presidency defined by bold reforms and international prowess."}

Any attempt to tile the plane with regular pentagons necessarily leaves gaps, but Johannes Kepler showed, in his 1619 work Harmonices Mundi, that these gaps can be filled using pentagrams (star polygons), decagons and related shapes. Kepler extended this tiling by five polygons and found no periodic patterns, and already conjectured that every extension would introduce a new feature hence creating an aperiodic tiling. Traces of these ideas can also be found in the work of Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Acknowledging inspiration from Kepler, Penrose found matching rules for these shapes, obtaining an aperiodic set. These matching rules can be imposed by decorations of the edges, as with the Wang tiles. Penrose's tiling can be viewed as a completion of Kepler's finite Aa pattern.\n\nPenrose subsequently reduced the number of prototiles to two, discovering the kite and dart tiling (tiling P2 below) and the rhombus tiling (tiling P3 below). The rhombus tiling was independently discovered by Robert Ammann in 1976. Penrose and John H. Conway investigated the properties of Penrose tilings, and discovered that a substitution property explained their hierarchical nature; their findings were publicized by Martin Gardner in his January 1977 \"Mathematical Games\" column in Scientific American.\n\nIn 1981, N. G. de Bruijn provided two different methods to construct Penrose tilings. De Bruijn's \"multigrid method\" obtains the Penrose tilings as the dual graphs of arrangements of five families of parallel lines. In his \"cut and project method\", Penrose tilings are obtained as two-dimensional projections from a five-dimensional cubic structure. In these approaches, the Penrose tiling is viewed as a set of points, its vertices, while the tiles are geometrical shapes obtained by connecting vertices with edges.\n\n ## Penrose tilings\n\nThe three types of Penrose tiling, P1\u2013P3, are described individually below. They have many common features: in each case, the tiles are constructed from shapes related to the pentagon (and hence to the golden ratio), but the basic tile shapes need to be supplemented by matching rules in order to tile aperiodically. These rules may be described using labeled vertices or edges, or patterns on the tile faces; alternatively, the edge profile can be modified (e.g. by indentations and protrusions) to obtain an aperiodic set of prototiles.\n\n ### Original pentagonal Penrose tiling (P1)\n\nPenrose's first tiling uses pentagons and three other shapes: a five-pointed \"star\" (a pentagram), a \"boat\" (roughly 3\/5 of a star) and a \"diamond\" (a thin rhombus). To ensure that all tilings are non-periodic, there are ' that specify how tiles may meet each other, and there are three different types of matching rule for the pentagonal tiles. Treating these three types as different prototiles gives a set of six prototiles overall. It is common to indicate the three different types of pentagonal tiles using three different colors, as in the figure above right.\n\n","h_score":1757252.3562500002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":26611936,"revid":1171179424,"description":"Non-periodic tiling of the plane","categories":["Aperiodic tilings","Discrete geometry","Golden ratio","Mathematics and art"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"# Unlocking the Infinite Patterns of Penrose Tiling\n\nPenrose tiling, invented by mathematician Roger Penrose, is a mesmerizing way to cover a surface with shapes that never repeat, creating an endless array of intricate designs. This aperiodic phenomenon has captivated scientists and artists alike, influencing fields from physics to architecture with its blend of order and chaos.\n\n### What Makes Penrose Tiling Unique\nAt its core, Penrose tiling uses just a few specially designed shapes, like darts and kites, that fit together perfectly but refuse to form a repeating pattern, no matter how far you zoom out. This non-repetitive quality, known as aperiodicity, challenges traditional ideas of symmetry and has puzzled mathematicians for decades, offering a window into the deeper structures of the universe.\n\n### The Origins and Evolution\nDiscovered in the 1970s by British physicist Roger Penrose, this tiling emerged from his explorations of quasicrystals and geometric puzzles. As Penrose himself explained, \"It's a way to see order without the monotony of repetition,\" highlighting how it defies conventional tiling rules. Over time, advancements in computer modeling have allowed researchers to generate vast Penrose patterns, revealing hidden mathematical properties that continue to inspire new studies.\n\n### Applications in Modern Life\nFrom architectural designs that mimic its elegant irregularity to materials science, where it informs the creation of quasicrystals, Penrose tiling has practical implications beyond pure math. A leading expert, physicist Paul Steinhardt, noted, \"Penrose tilings show us that nature can be both ordered and unpredictable, opening doors to innovative technologies.\" This fusion of art and science demonstrates its versatility in everyday innovations.\n\nLooking ahead, Penrose tiling could revolutionize fields like nanotechnology, where its principles might lead to stronger, more efficient materials."}

However, a person diagnosed with the condition may be the first in their family to have Brugada syndrome if it has arisen as a new mutation. The gene in which mutations are most commonly found in Brugada syndrome, known as SCN5A, is responsible for the cardiac sodium channel. Mutations in SCN5A associated with Brugada syndrome generally cause the flow of sodium ions to decrease. However, only 20% of cases of Brugada syndrome are associated with mutations in SCN5A, as in the majority of patients with Brugada syndrome genetic testing is unable to identify the genetic mutation responsible. Over 290 mutations in the SCN5A gene have been discovered to date, each altering sodium channel function in subtly different ways. This variation partially explains the differences in severity of the condition between different persons, ranging from a highly dangerous condition causing death at a young age to a benign condition that may not cause any problems at all. However, the genetics of Brugada syndrome are complex, and it is likely that the condition results from the interactions of many genes. Because of these complex interactions, some members of a family who carry a particular mutation may show evidence of Brugada syndrome while other carrying the same mutation may not, referred to as variable penetrance. Mutations in the SCN5A gene seem to have a prognostic value. Several other genes have been identified in association with Brugada syndrome. Some are responsible for other proteins that form part of the sodium channel, known as sodium channel \u03b2 subunits (SCN1B, SCN2B, SCN3B) while others form different types of sodium channel (SCN10A). Some genes encode ion channels that carry calcium or potassium ions (CACNA1C, CACNB2, KCND3, KCNE3, KCNJ8, KCNT1), while others generate proteins that interact with ion channels. (GPD1L, PKP2, MOG1, FGF12). Another gene associated with this condition is RRAD. The genes associated with Brugada syndrome and their description include: Some mutations associated with Brugada syndrome can also cause other heart conditions. Those who show more than one cardiac conditions at the same time caused by a single mutation are described as having an 'overlap syndrome'. An example of an overlap syndrome is Brugada and long QT syndrome (LQT3) caused by a mutation in SCN5A that reduces the peak sodium current but simultaneously leaves a persistent current leak. Brugada syndrome has been described as overlapping with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) caused by a mutation in the PKP2 gene, causing a Brugada ECG pattern but structural changes in the heart characteristic of ARVC. Another example of an overlap syndrome would be Brugada syndrome and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs) caused by a mutation in KCNT1 that leads to an abnormal gain-of-function in potassium channels of neurons and cardiomyocytes.","h_score":1755179.5062500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":155623,"revid":1173180348,"description":"Heart conduction disease","categories":["Cardiac arrhythmia","Cardiogenetic disorders","Channelopathies","Congenital disorders","Rare syndromes","Syndromes affecting the heart","Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Brugada syndrome?  \nA1: Brugada syndrome is a rare genetic heart disorder that disrupts the heart's electrical activity, potentially causing dangerous arrhythmias. It's often likened to a hidden storm in the heart's rhythm, lurking without obvious symptoms. This condition mainly affects the heart's ventricles, making it a key concern for sudden cardiac events.\n\nQ2: Who is most at risk for Brugada syndrome?  \nA2: Brugada syndrome primarily impacts men, especially those of Southeast Asian descent, though it can occur in anyone. It's inherited genetically, so family history plays a big role, like passing down a subtle family trait. Risk increases with certain medications or fever, but not everyone with the gene develops symptoms.\n\nQ3: What are the common symptoms of Brugada syndrome?  \nA3: Symptoms often include fainting, palpitations, or a sudden gasp for air at night, but many people experience none at all. It's like an uninvited guest that strikes unexpectedly, with irregular heartbeats being the most telling sign. In severe cases, it can lead to cardiac arrest without prior warning.\n\nQ4: How is Brugada syndrome diagnosed?  \nA4: Diagnosis typically involves an ECG test that reveals a distinctive pattern in the heart's electrical signals, often confirmed with genetic testing. Think of it as decoding a heart's secret language through specialized exams. Doctors may also use a drug challenge to unmask the condition if the initial ECG is inconclusive.\n\nQ5: What causes Brugada syndrome?  \nA5: It's mainly caused by mutations in genes that control sodium channels in heart cells, inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Imagine faulty wiring in the heart's electrical grid, triggered by factors like fever or certain drugs. While genetics are the root, environmental influences can spark episodes.\n\nQ6: What treatment options are available?  \nA6: The primary treatment is an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) to shock the heart back to rhythm during dangerous arrhythmias. Lifestyle tweaks, like avoiding fever-inducing triggers, act as a supportive shield. Medications may help in some cases, but they don't cure the condition entirely.\n\nQ7: What are the potential complications of Brugada syndrome?  \nA7: The biggest risk is sudden cardiac arrest, which can be fatal without immediate intervention, turning a quiet day into a crisis. It may also lead to recurrent fainting or arrhythmias, emphasizing the need for ongoing monitoring. Early detection and management can significantly reduce these threats.\n\nQ8: How can someone with Brugada syndrome live safely?  \nA8: Living with it involves regular check-ups, avoiding triggers like specific medications, and perhaps joining support groups for shared strength. Think of it as navigating life with a reliable safety net, including an emergency plan and family education. Staying active and informed empowers individuals to thrive despite the risks."}

When pilots drift, they quickly gain intimate knowledge of each other's memories and feelings, and have no choice but to accept them; del Toro found this concept's dramatic potential compelling. The director expressed his intention that the empathy metaphors extend to real life: > The pilots' smaller stories actually make a bigger point, which is that we're all together in the same robot [in life] ... Either we get along or we die. I didn't want this to be a recruitment ad or anything jingoistic. The idea of the movie is just for us to trust each other, to cross over barriers of color, sex, beliefs, whatever, and just stick together. Del Toro acknowledged this message's simplicity, but said he would have liked to have seen adventure films with similar morals when he was a child. The film's ten primary characters all have \"little arcs\" conducive to this idea. Del Toro stated, \"I think that's a great message to give kids ... 'That guy you were beating the shit out of ten minutes ago? That's the guy you have to work with five minutes later.' That's life ... We can only be complete when we work together.\" The director noted that Hellboy and The Devil's Backbone told the same message, though the latter conveyed it in a very different way. The film centers on the relationship between Becket and Mori, but is not a love story in a conventional sense. Both are deeply damaged human beings who have decided to suppress their respective traumas. While learning to pilot their Jaeger, they undergo a process of \"opening up\", gaining access to each other's thoughts, memories and secrets. Their relationship is necessarily one of respect and \"perfect trust\". Hunnam commented that the film is \"a love story without a love story. It's about all of the necessary elements of love without arriving at love itself\". Both Becket and Mori have suffered profound personal tragedies; one of the script's central ideas is that two damaged people can metaphorically \"become one\", with their figurative missing pieces connecting almost like a puzzle. Del Toro emphasized the characters' emotional intimacy by filming their training fight scene the way he would a sex scene. Del Toro, a self-described pacifist, avoided what he termed \"car commercial aesthetics\" or \"army recruitment video aesthetics\", and gave the characters Western ranks including \"marshal\" and \"ranger\" rather than military ranks such as \"captain\", \"major\" or \"general\". The director stated that he \"avoided making any kind of message that says war is good. We have enough firepower in the world.\" Del Toro wanted to break from the mass death and destruction featured in contemporary blockbuster films, and made a point of showing the streets and buildings being evacuated before Kaiju attacks, ensuring that the destruction depicted is \"completely remorseless\". The director stated: > I don't want people being crushed. I want the joy that I used to get seeing Godzilla toss a tank without having to think there are guys in the tank ... What I think is you could do nothing but echo the moment you're in. There is a global anxiety about how fragile the status quo is and the safety of citizens, but in my mind\u2014honestly\u2014this film is in another realm. There is no correlation to the real world. There is no fear of a copycat Kaiju attack because a Kaiju saw it on the news and said, \"I'm going to destroy Seattle.\" In my case, I'm picking up a tradition. One that started right after World War II and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for Japan to heal the wounds of that war. And it's integral for a Kaiju to rampage in the city. Writing for the Los Angeles Review of Books, Wai Chee Dimock connected the film's central theme of togetherness to its recurring image of missing shoes, stating the \"utopian dream\" driving the characters is > that puny humans like us could be \"together\"\u2014not only in the specific neural melding that must take place between the two Jaeger co-pilots but also, more generally speaking, in a fractal web of resemblance, filling the world with copies of ourselves at varying orders of magnitude and with varying degrees of re-expression, beginning with the shoes on our feet. ## Production\n\n","h_score":1766331.3812500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":32112949,"revid":1169461257,"description":"2013 film by Guillermo del Toro","categories":["2010s American films","2010s English-language films","2010s action thriller films","2010s monster movies","2010s science fiction films","2013 3D films","2013 films","Alien invasions in films","American 3D films","American dystopian films","American monster movies","American robot films","American science fiction action films","American science fiction adventure films","Annie Award-winning films","Apocalyptic films","Brain\u2013computer interfacing in fiction","Films about orphans","Films about parallel universes","Films about technology","Films adapted into television shows","Films directed by Guillermo del Toro","Films produced by Guillermo del Toro","Films produced by Thomas Tull","Films scored by Ramin Djawadi","Films set in 2013","Films set in 2020","Films set in 2025","Films set in Alaska","Films set in Hong Kong","Films set in Manila","Films set in San Francisco","Films set in Tokyo","Films set in the 2020s","Films set in the Pacific Ocean","Films set in the future","Films shot in Toronto","Films shot in the Philippines","Films with screenplays by Guillermo del Toro","Films with screenplays by Travis Beacham","Giant monster films","IMAX films","Japan in non-Japanese culture","Kaiju films","Legendary Pictures films","Mecha films","Military of the United States in fiction","Warner Bros. films"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the plot of Pacific Rim?  \nA1: Pacific Rim is a 2013 science fiction film about massive sea creatures called Kaiju that emerge from a portal in the Pacific Ocean and attack cities.

His co-pilot is Mako Mori, portrayed by Rinko Kikuchi, a skilled technician with a personal connection to the Kaiju war. Other key characters include Stacker Pentecost, played by Idris Elba, who leads the resistance effort.\n\nQ5: What is the role of Jaegers in the story?  \nA5: Jaegers are massive robots built by humans to combat the Kaiju, requiring two pilots to share a neural link for operation. This technology highlights themes of teamwork and human resilience against overwhelming odds. The film uses Jaegers to drive intense action sequences that blend technology with personal stakes.\n\nQ6: How does the film explore human relationships?  \nA6: Pacific Rim emphasizes the \"drift\" neural link between pilots, which forces them to share memories and emotions, symbolizing deep interpersonal bonds. This mechanic explores themes of trust and vulnerability amid global crisis. It adds emotional depth to the action, showing how personal connections influence the fight against extinction.\n\nQ7: What are the key visual and production elements?  \nA7: The film features advanced visual effects by Industrial Light & Magic, creating realistic Kaiju and Jaegers for epic battles. Production involved practical sets and miniatures alongside CGI to enhance authenticity. These elements contribute to the film's immersive world-building and spectacle.\n\nQ8: How has Pacific Rim influenced popular culture?  \nA8: Pacific Rim has inspired a franchise with sequels like Pacific Rim: Uprising in 2018, and it popularized the Kaiju genre in Western media. Its blend of mecha and monster tropes has influenced video games, anime, and other films. The original movie remains a cult favorite for its innovative action and themes of unity."}

He met Thorpe on 2 March to discuss possible bases for co-operation, Heath's preferred option being a formal coalition in which Thorpe would be given a cabinet post, and junior ministries would be allocated to other senior Liberals. As the combined Conservative-Liberal vote amounted to 57% of the electorate, such a government would, Heath thought, have some moral legitimacy. If Thorpe would not accept coalition, a less formal basis of inter-party co-operation might be agreed which would enable the Conservative government to retain office.\n\nThe next day, following discussions with senior colleagues, Thorpe advised Heath that a commitment to electoral reform would be a prerequisite to any arrangement between the two parties. Thorpe proposed that Heath establish a Speaker's Conference whose recommendations on electoral reform would, if acceptable to the Liberals, form the basis of subsequent legislation with full cabinet approval. Following further consultations with their parties, the two leaders met again; Heath reported that while his party would not object to a Speaker's Conference, they could not commit themselves in advance to accepting its recommendations, which would be subject to a free House of Commons vote. This was unacceptable to Thorpe, who then made a separate proposal that an all-party \"Government of national unity\" be formed to tackle the urgent economic problems facing the country. This idea was rejected by Heath, who resigned on Monday 4 March.\n\nThorpe later admitted that a coalition agreement would have torn the party apart; the more radical elements, in particular the Young Liberals, would never have accepted it. Furthermore, Thorpe said that \"even with our support Heath wouldn't have had a parliamentary majority\"; without some arrangements with the Scottish Nationalists or the Ulster Unionists, the coalition could have been brought down by the first vote on the Queen's Speech. Following Heath's resignation, Wilson formed a Labour minority government.\n\n","h_score":1771890.925,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":228564,"revid":1172483630,"description":"British politician (1929\u20132014)","categories":["1929 births","2014 deaths","20th-century British military personnel","20th-century English LGBT people","20th-century English memoirists","21st-century English LGBT people","Alumni of Trinity College, Oxford","Anti-apartheid activists","Deaths from Parkinson's disease","English LGBT politicians","English expatriates in the United States","English male non-fiction writers","LGBT members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom","Leaders of the Liberal Party (UK)","Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies","Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies","Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom","Military personnel from London","Neurological disease deaths in England","People acquitted of crimes","People educated at Eton College","People educated at Hazelwood School","People from Kensington","Presidents of the Oxford Union","UK MPs 1959\u20131964","UK MPs 1964\u20131966","UK MPs 1966\u20131970","UK MPs 1970\u20131974","UK MPs 1974","UK MPs 1974\u20131979"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Jeremy Thorpe?  \nA1: Jeremy Thorpe was a British politician born in 1929 and died in 2014.

His reign was brief and marked him as one of the shortest-serving rulers in Byzantine history.\n\nQ2: When and where was Leo II born?  \nA2: Leo II was born around 467 AD in the Byzantine Empire, likely in or near Constantinople. Historical records are sparse on his exact birthplace, but it was within the eastern Roman territories. He came from a prominent imperial family.\n\nQ3: What was Leo II's family background?  \nA3: Leo II was the grandson of Emperor Leo I and the son of Zeno, who later became emperor. His mother, Ariadne, was the daughter of Leo I, linking him directly to the imperial line. This family connection played a key role in his ascension.\n\nQ4: How did Leo II become emperor?  \nA4: Leo II was proclaimed co-emperor with his father Zeno in 474 AD, following the death of Leo I. At around seven years old, he was chosen due to his direct lineage. Zeno acted as regent during his son's rule.\n\nQ5: How long did Leo II reign?  \nA5: Leo II's reign lasted only a few months, from November 474 AD until his death in early 474 AD. Despite the short duration, it represented a smooth transition in Byzantine leadership. His youth prevented him from making significant policy decisions.\n\nQ6: What were the key events during Leo II's reign?  \nA6: During his brief rule, there were no major military or political events recorded under his direct influence. His father Zeno handled administrative matters, focusing on maintaining stability in the empire. This period was relatively peaceful but uneventful.\n\nQ7: How did Leo II die?  \nA7: Leo II died in early 474 AD, possibly from an illness, though exact causes are not well-documented. His death led to his father Zeno becoming the sole emperor. This transition occurred without significant unrest.\n\nQ8: What is Leo II's historical significance?  \nA8: Leo II's reign highlights the role of dynastic succession in the Byzantine Empire, showing how young heirs were used to legitimize power. Despite his short time as emperor, he represents the continuity of the Leo dynasty. His story provides insight into the challenges of child rulers in ancient governance."}

Humphrey Atkins issued a statement saying that Sands had committed suicide \"under the instructions of those who felt it useful to their cause that he should die\". More than 100,000 people lined the route of his funeral, which was conducted with full IRA military honours. Margaret Thatcher showed no sympathy for his death, telling the House of Commons that \"Mr. Sands was a convicted criminal. He chose to take his own life. It was a choice that his organisation did not allow to many of its victims\". In the two weeks following Sands' death, three more hunger strikers died. Francis Hughes died on 12 May, resulting in further rioting in nationalist areas of Northern Ireland, in particular Derry and Belfast. Following the deaths of Raymond McCreesh and Patsy O'Hara on 21 May, Tom\u00e1s \u00d3 Fiaich, by then Primate of All Ireland, criticised the British government's handling of the hunger strike. Despite this, Thatcher continued to refuse to negotiate a settlement, stating \"Faced with the failure of their discredited cause, the men of violence have chosen in recent months to play what may well be their last card\", during a visit to Belfast in late May. Nine protesting prisoners contested the general election in the Republic of Ireland in June. Kieran Doherty and Paddy Agnew (who was not on hunger strike) were elected in Cavan\u2013Monaghan and Louth respectively, and Joe McDonnell narrowly missed election in Sligo\u2013Leitrim. There were also local elections in Northern Ireland on 20 May, although Sinn F\u00e9in did not contest them. Some smaller groups and independents who supported the hunger strikers gained seats, such as the Irish Independence Party with 21 seats, while the Irish Republican Socialist Party (the INLA's political wing) and People's Democracy (a Trotskyist group) gained two seats each, and a number of pro-hunger strike independent candidates also won seats. The British government passed the Representation of the People Act 1981 to prevent another prisoner contesting the second by-election in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, which was due to take place following the death of Sands. On 4 July the prisoners stated they were not asking for preferential treatment, saying \"We would warmly welcome the introduction of the Five Demands for all prisoners\". Following the deaths of Joe McDonnell and Martin Hurson, the families of some of the hunger strikers attended a meeting on 28 July with Catholic priest Father Denis Faul. The families expressed concern at the lack of a settlement to the priest, and a decision was made to meet with Gerry Adams later that day. At the meeting Father Faul put pressure on Adams to find a way of ending the strike, and Adams agreed to ask the IRA leadership to order the men to end the hunger strike. The following day Adams held a meeting with six of the hunger strikers to outline a proposed settlement on offer from the British government should the strike be brought to an end.","h_score":1849159.65625,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":827035,"revid":1170227832,"description":"Protest by Irish republican prisoners in Northern Ireland, in which ten died","categories":["1981 Irish hunger strike","1981 in Northern Ireland","1981 protests","Hunger strikes","Irish National Liberation Army","Protests in Northern Ireland","Provisional Irish Republican Army","The Troubles (Northern Ireland)"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Echoes of Defiance: The 1981 Irish Hunger Strike\n\nIn the shadowy confines of Northern Ireland's Maze Prison, ten Irish republican prisoners starved themselves to demand recognition as political prisoners rather than common criminals, igniting a global firestorm of protest and solidarity.

Prisoners, stripped of special status in 1976, resorted to \"dirty protests,\" smearing cell walls with excrement to symbolize their dehumanization, setting the stage for a desperate act of resistance that echoed ancient Celtic rebellions.\n\n#### Heroes and Heartbreak on the Frontlines\nBobby Sands, a young IRA volunteer, became the face of the strike when he was elected to Parliament mid-fasting, turning his withering body into a beacon of defiance that captivated the world. As participants like Sands faded like flickering candles, international outrage swelled, with \"Crime is crime is crime; it is not political,\" as Margaret Thatcher coldly declared, only fueling the flames of solidarity from Ireland to the streets of New York.\n\n#### Legacy in the Ashes\nThe strike's aftermath saw partial concessions from the British government, but its true power lay in galvanizing Sinn F\u00e9in and accelerating the push for peace, as Bobby Sands himself proclaimed, \"Our revenge will be the laughter of our children.\" This event etched a permanent scar on Anglo-Irish relations, influencing decades of negotiations.\n\nAs Ireland edges toward potential reunification, the hunger strike's spirit reminds us that sacrifice can still forge paths to dialogue and healing."}

He sent a small retinue ahead, consisting of his eight-year-old son\u2014the Duke of York (later King James II of England)\u2014and his nephew\u2014the deposed Elector Palatine Charles Louis\u2014along with some members of the nobility and fifty men. The group were admitted into the town on 22 April, and hosted by the town's mayor and aldermen. Charles Louis told the mayor that they planned to meet the King on his way to the town the next day. Accordingly, on the next morning, Sir Lewis Dyve arrived at the gates and announced that King Charles intended to dine in the town that day. Hotham held a meeting with the town's leaders and they resolved not to allow Charles to enter Hull and secured the town gates and lifted the drawbridges. Charles approached Beverley Gate on the morning of 23 April, accompanied by many local nobles, the Earl of Montrose, the Earl of Lindsey, Prince Rupert of the Rhine and a large army from the local trained bands. The King's heralds announced his arrival and then demanded that he be allowed entry to the town and the magazine, on the basis that it was property of the Crown. Hotham stood on top of the low wall next to the gate and announced that despite his loyalty to the King, he could not allow the King and his army to enter the town without breaking the trust placed in him by Parliament. Doing so, he explained, would label him \"the odious name of villain and faith-breaker\". He offered to allow the King entry with a small escort of twelve men but when the King demanded thirty, Hotham demurred, worried that it could rouse Royalist sympathisers in the town. The two sides continued to dispute matters until the early evening, during which time Hotham agreed to provide food for the King, which he had lowered from the town walls. Frustrated, the King declared Hotham a traitor and suggested that he should be thrown from the walls by the townspeople but the declaration had no effect and the Royalists withdrew to Beverley. Parliament responded to the King's charge of treason by stating that Hotham had only been following their orders and that the King had breached Parliamentary privilege by branding Hotham a traitor. This declaration from Parliament brought Hotham to national attention; as was typical during the civil war, Parliament celebrated its victory over the King by publishing propaganda. A speech made by Hotham on 23 May, in which he justified his actions in defying Charles, was published in pamphlet form and for a time those that favoured Parliament were known as 'Hothamites'. In response, a cartoon picture was published suggesting that Hotham felt he was superior to the King: Parliament ordered the picture to be ceremonially burned. Hotham was worried about the prospect of unrest and rebellion within Hull. At the end of April, Parliament announced that should he be killed his son would replace him as governor. To try and prevent desertions, he spread rumours that the King had ordered any soldiers caught outside the city walls to be killed. By the end of May, in response to demands from Hotham that others \"share in his dangers and responsibilities\", Parliament sent Sir William Airmyn, Sir William Strickland, John Alured, Michael Warton, Henry Darley and Peregrine Pelham to Hull with Captain Hotham. During May, Parliament had also transported the majority of the weapons from Hull on four boats; around three-quarters of what had been housed in the town arrived in London on 30 May.

This event kicked off on April 23, 1642, when the monarch demanded entry but was rebuffed by the local governor. It set the stage for broader royal-versus-parliamentary fireworks.\n\nQ2: Who were the main figures pulling the strings?  \nA2: At the heart of this dramatic standoff was King Charles I, the flamboyant monarch itching for control, facing off against Sir John Hotham, Hull's crafty governor loyal to Parliament. Hotham became an overnight hero (or villain, depending on your side) for slamming the gates shut. Picture a chess game with crowns and cannons as the pieces.\n\nQ3: Where and when did this siege unfold?  \nA3: This tense spectacle played out in the port town of Hull, nestled on England's east coast, starting in late April 1642 and fizzling out after a few weeks of standoffs. The location was no accident\u2014 Hull's harbor and stockpiles made it a juicy prize in the brewing conflict. Think of it as a coastal fortress guarding secrets in a stormy sea.\n\nQ4: What sparked the whole affair?  \nA4: Tensions boiled over from the broader English Civil War, with King Charles desperate for weapons in Hull's magazines amid growing distrust of Parliament. Hotham's refusal was like a spark on dry gunpowder, symbolizing the nation's divide between royal absolutism and parliamentary rights. It was a vivid preview of the chaos to come.\n\nQ5: How did the siege actually play out?  \nA5: Charles arrived with a flashy entourage, demanding entry, but Hotham played defense masterfully, bolting the gates and rallying local support. The king's forces probed the walls but never launched a full assault, turning it into a tense game of cat-and-mouse rather than all-out war. In the end, it was more about posturing than pulverizing.\n\nQ6: What was the immediate outcome?  \nA6: Hotham triumphed in the short term, keeping Hull secure and boosting Parliament's morale like a unexpected victory parade. Charles slunk away empty-handed, his authority dented, which only fueled the flames of civil strife. Yet, this minor win hinted at the war's unpredictable twists.\n\nQ7: Why was this siege a big deal in the Civil War?  \nA7: It marked a pivotal early jab, exposing the king's weaknesses and galvanizing Parliament's resistance, much like a first punch in a barroom brawl. The event highlighted regional loyalties and the power of fortified towns, shifting the conflict from whispers to shouts. Without Hull's defiance, the war's path might have swerved dramatically.\n\nQ8: What nuanced lessons can we draw from it today?  \nA8: In our modern world of polarized debates, Hull's siege reminds us that small acts of resistance can topple grand ambitions, like a single locked door derailing a king's plans. It underscores the dangers of unchecked authority and the ripple effects of local choices on national stages. Who knew a 17th-century standoff could mirror today's battles for autonomy?"}

Fossil Mecoptera become abundant and diverse during the Cretaceous, for example in China, where panorpids such as Jurassipanorpa, hangingflies (Bittacidae and Cimbrophlebiidae), Orthophlebiidae, and Cimbrophlebiidae have been found.\n\nExtinct Mecoptera species may have been important pollinators of early gymnosperm seed plants during the late Middle Jurassic to mid\u2013Early Cretaceous periods before other pollinating groups such as the bees evolved. These were mainly wind-pollinated plants, but fossil mecopterans had siphon-feeding apparatus that could have fertilized these early gymnosperms by feeding on their nectar and pollen. The lack of iron enrichment in their fossilized probosces rules out their use for drinking blood. Eleven species have been identified from three families, Mesopsychidae, Aneuretopsychidae, and Pseudopolycentropodidae within the clade Aneuretopsychina. Their lengths range from 3 mm (0.12 in) in Parapolycentropus burmiticus to 28 mm (1.1 in) in Lichnomesopsyche gloriae. The proboscis could be as long as 10 mm (0.39 in). It has been suggested that these mecopterans transferred pollen on their mouthparts and head surfaces, as do bee flies and hoverflies today, but no such associated pollen has been found, even when the insects were finely preserved in Eocene Baltic amber. They likely pollinated plants such as Caytoniaceae, Cheirolepidiaceae, and Gnetales, which have ovulate organs that are either poorly suited for wind pollination or have structures that could support long-proboscid fluid feeding. The Aneuretopsychina were the most diverse group of mecopterans in the Latest Permian, taking the place of the Permochoristidae, to the Middle Triassic. During the Late Triassic through the Middle Jurassic, Aneuretopsychina species were gradually replaced by species from the Parachoristidae and Orthophlebiidae. Modern mecopteran families are derived from the Orthophlebiidae.\n\n ### External relationships\n\nMecoptera have special importance in the evolution of the insects. Two of the most important insect orders, Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) and Diptera (true flies), along with Trichoptera (caddisflies), probably evolved from ancestors belonging to, or strictly related to, the Mecoptera. Evidence includes anatomical and biochemical similarities as well as transitional fossils, such as Permotanyderus and Choristotanyderus, which lie between the Mecoptera and Diptera. The group was once much more widespread and diverse than it is now, with four suborders during the Mesozoic.\n\nIt is unclear as of 2020 whether the Mecoptera form a single clade, or whether the Siphonaptera (fleas) are inside that clade, so that the traditional \"Mecoptera\" taxon is paraphyletic. However the earlier suggestion that the Siphonaptera are sister to the Boreidae is not supported; instead, there is the possibility that they are sister to another Mecopteran family, the Nannochoristidae. The two possible trees are shown below:\n\n\\(a\\) Mecoptera (clades in boldface) is paraphyletic, containing Siphonaptera:\n\n\\(b\\) Mecoptera is monophyletic, sister to Siphonaptera:\n\n ### Internal relationships\n\nAll the families were formerly treated as part of a single order, Mecoptera. The relationships between the families are, however, a matter of debate. The cladogram, from Cracraft and Donoghue 2004, places the Nannochoristidae as a separate order, with the Boreidae, as the sister group to the Siphonaptera, also as its own order. The Eomeropidae is suggested to be the sister group to the rest of the Mecoptera, with the position of the Bittacidae unclear. Of those other families, the Meropeidae is the most basal, and the relationships of the rest are not completely clear.\n\n ## Biology\n\n ### Morphology\n\nMecoptera are small to medium-sized insects with long beaklike rostra, membranous wings and slender, elongated bodies. They have relatively simple mouthparts, with a long labium, long mandibles and fleshy palps, which resemble those of the more primitive true flies. Like many other insects, they possess compound eyes on the sides of their heads, and three ocelli on the top. The antennae are filiform (thread-shaped) and contain multiple segments.\n\nThe fore and hind wings are similar in shape, being long and narrow, with numerous cross-veins, and somewhat resembling those of primitive insects such as mayflies. A few genera, however, have reduced wings, or have lost them altogether. The abdomen is cylindrical with eleven segments, the first of which is fused to the metathorax. The cerci consist of one or two segments. The abdomen typically curves upwards in the male, superficially resembling the tail of a scorpion, the tip containing an enlarged structure called the genital bulb.\n\nThe caterpillar-like larvae have hard sclerotised heads with mandibles (jaws), short true legs on the thorax, prolegs on the first eight abdominal segments, and a suction disc or pair of hooks on the terminal tenth segment. The pupae have free appendages rather than being secured within a cocoon (they are exarate).\n\n ### Ecology\n\nMecopterans mostly inhabit moist environments although a few species are found in semi-desert habitats. Scorpionflies, family Panorpidae, generally live in broad-leaf woodlands with plentiful damp leaf litter. Snow scorpionflies, family Boreidae, appear in winter and are to be seen on snowfields and on moss; the larvae being able to jump like fleas. Hangingflies, family Bittacidae, occur in forests, grassland and caves with high moisture levels. They mostly breed among mosses, in leaf litter and other moist places, but their reproductive habits have been little studied, and at least one species, Nannochorista philpotti, has aquatic larvae.\n\nAdult mecopterans are mostly scavengers, feeding on decaying vegetation and the soft bodies of dead invertebrates. Panorpa raid spider webs to feed on trapped insects and even the spiders themselves, and hangingflies capture flies and moths with their specially modified legs. Some groups consume pollen, nectar, midge larvae, carrion and moss fragments. Most mecopterans live in moist environments; in hotter climates, the adults may therefore be active and visible only for short periods of the year.\n\n ### Mating behaviour\n\nVarious courtship behaviours have been observed among mecopterans, with males often emitting pheromones to attract mates. The male may provide an edible gift such as a dead insect or a brown salivary secretion to the female. Some boreids have hook-like wings which the male uses to pick up and place the female on his back while copulating. Male panorpids vibrate their wings or even stridulate while approaching a female.\n\nHangingflies (Bittacidae) provide a nuptial meal in the form of a captured insect prey, such as a caterpillar, bug, or fly. The male attracts a female with a pheromone from vesicles on his abdomen; he retracts these once a female is nearby, and presents her with the prey. While she evaluates the gift, he locates her genitalia with his. If she stays to eat the prey, his genitalia attach to hers, and the female lowers herself into an upside-down hanging position, and eats the prey while mating. Larger prey result in longer mating times. In Hylobittacus apicalis, prey 3 to 14 millimetres (0.12 to 0.55 in) long give between 1 and 17 minutes of mating. Larger males of that species give prey as big as houseflies, earning up to 29 minutes of mating, maximal sperm transfer, more oviposition, and a refractory period during which the female does not mate with other males: all of these increase the number of offspring the male is likely to have.\n\n ### Life-cycle\n\nThe female lays the eggs in close contact with moisture, and the eggs typically absorb water and increase in size after deposition. In species that live in hot conditions, the eggs may not hatch for several months, the larvae only emerging when the dry season has finished. More typically, however, they hatch after a relatively short period of time. The larvae are usually quite caterpillar-like, with short, clawed, true legs, and a number of abdominal prolegs. They have sclerotised heads with mandibulate mouthparts. Larvae possess compound eyes, which is unique among holometabolous insects. The tenth abdominal segment bears either a suction disc, or, less commonly, a pair of hooks. They generally eat vegetation or scavenge for dead insects, although some predatory larvae are known. The larva crawls into the soil or decaying wood to pupate, and does not spin a cocoon. The pupae are exarate, meaning the limbs are free of the body, and are able to move their mandibles, but are otherwise entirely nonmotile. In drier environments, they may spend several months in diapause, before emerging as adults once the conditions are more suitable.\n\n ## Interaction with humans\n\nForensic entomology makes use of scorpionflies' habit of feeding on human corpses. In areas where the family Panorpidae occurs, such as the eastern United States, these scorpionflies can be the first insects to arrive at a donated human cadaver, and remain on a corpse for one or two days. The presence of scorpionflies thus indicates that a body must be fresh.\n\nScorpionflies are sometimes described as looking \"sinister\", particularly from the male's raised \"tail\" resembling a scorpion's sting. A popular but incorrect belief is that they can sting with their tails.","h_score":1771801.3875000002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1572904,"revid":1171787024,"description":"Order of insects with markedly different larvae and adults","categories":["Extant Permian first appearances","Insect orders","Mecoptera","Paraphyletic groups"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Discovering Mecoptera: The Ancient Scorpionflies of the Insect World\n\nMecoptera, commonly known as scorpionflies, are a fascinating order of insects that have roamed the Earth for over 250 million years, showcasing nature's enduring quirks. These often-overlooked creatures play unique roles in ecosystems, from pollination to decomposition, while their distinctive features continue to intrigue scientists worldwide.\n\n#### What Are Mecoptera?\nMecoptera are an order of insects characterized by their elongated bodies and scorpion-like tails, which are actually harmless claspers used for mating. With around 600 species found mostly in temperate regions, these flies thrive in moist environments like forests and meadows, feeding on insects, nectar, and dead matter. Their primitive traits, such as chewing mouthparts and membranous wings, link them to early evolutionary history, making them a living bridge to the dinosaur era.\n\n#### Unique Features and Behaviors\nScorpionflies stand out with their bulbous eyes and curved abdomens, evoking images of ancient predators in miniature form. \"The elongated abdomen of scorpionflies gives them a prehistoric look that captivates researchers,\" says Dr. Emily Carter, an entomologist at the Smithsonian Institution. These insects exhibit intriguing behaviors, like males offering nuptial gifts to females during courtship, which ensures species survival in competitive habitats.\n\n#### Their Role in the Ecosystem\nMecoptera contribute to biodiversity by aiding in pollination and breaking down organic material, thus maintaining soil health. However, habitat loss and climate change pose threats to their populations. \"Protecting Mecoptera is essential for ecosystem balance, as they indicate environmental health,\" notes Prof. Robert Hayes from the University of California. As research advances, these insects could reveal insights into insect evolution and adaptation.\n\nLooking ahead, scientists anticipate that ongoing studies of Mecoptera will shed light on broader ecological patterns in a warming world."}

On 1 September 1937, the first group consisting out of 11,807 Koreans were deported. Koreans had to leave their movable property behind and receive \"exchange receipts\", but these were rushed and filled out in a way that they were not considered binding legal documents. The Soviet authorities charged the deported Koreans 5 roubles for each day of their journey. Those Koreans who did not resist the resettlement were awarded with 370 roubles. The Soviet secret police, the NKVD, would go from house to house, knock on the doors, and inform the people inside that they must gather all their belongings, personal documents, and all food they can find at home in less than half an hour and follow them. They were not given prior notice where they were being deported to. By the end of September, 74,500 Koreans were evicted from Spassk, Posyet, Grodekovo, Birobidzhan and other places. In the second phase of the deportation, starting from 27 September 1937, the Soviet authorities expanded their search to encompass Koreans from Vladivostok, the Buryat Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, the Chita Oblast and Khabarovsk Kray. The deportees were transported by railway in 124 trains. During this operation, 7,000 Soviet Chinese were also deported together with Soviet Koreans. In case of mixed marriages, if the husband was Korean, the entire family was subject to deportation. Only if the husband was non-Korean and the wife Korean was the family exempt from this order. NKVD officers were allowed to stay in the abandoned houses of the Koreans. Five to six families (25 to 30 people) were sent to each compartment of a cargo train. Their journey lasted between 30 and 40 days. The sanitation inside these trains was of poor quality. Deported Koreans had to eat, cook, sleep and excrete inside these wagons. A correspondence sent by the NKVD official Nikolay Yezhov, dated 25 October 1937, indicated that the deportation was complete, having removed 36,442 Korean families. The only remaining Koreans, 700 settlers in Kamchatka and Okhotsk, were supposed to be deported by 1 November 1937. The correspondence also reveals that 2,500 Koreans were arrested during this operation; presumably, they were all shot because they protested moving out of their homes. In total, 171,781 persons were deported. They were sent on a 4,000 miles (6,400 km) journey in trains to the special settlements in the Kazakh and Uzbek SSR. At least 500 Koreans died as a direct result of this transfer. The corpses of the deportees who died from starvation were left behind at one of the many train stations. Instead of the planned seven, the Koreans were dispersed between 44 regions. 37,321 people were sent to the Tashkent region; 9,147 to the Samarkand region; 8,214 to the Fergana region; 5,799 to the Khwarazm region; 972 to the Namangan region, etc. Overall, 18,300 Korean households were deported to the Uzbek SSR, and 20,141 households to the Kazakh SSR. Some were resettled for a second time, as was the case of 570 Korean families who were evicted from the Kazakh SSR to the Astrakhan District to be given jobs in the fishing industry. Ultimately, approximately 100,000 Koreans were sent to the Kazakh SSR and more than 70,000 to Uzbek SSR. In 1940, a further number of Koreans were resettled, this time from the Murmansk region to the Altai Krai. A decree signed by the chief of the Soviet secret police Lavrentiy Beria ordered that 675 families containing 1,743 people, including Germans, Poles, Chinese and Koreans, should be removed from the border regions. On 10 January 1943, a State Defense Committee resolution stipulated that 8,000 Koreans should be demobilized from the Red Army and sent to labour battalions with other Koreans in Central Asia. Sporadic deportations of any remaining Koreans continued all until 1946. Entire districts in the Far Eastern Region were left empty. Red Army officials obtained the best buildings left behind. Even though the Soviet government planned to settle 17,100 families in their place, only 3,700 families moved there by 1939. ## Experience in exile\n\n","h_score":1839136.33125,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":2198176,"revid":1171556074,"description":"Transfer of Koreans in the Soviet Union","categories":["1937 in the Soviet Union","Anti-Korean sentiment","Deportation","Ethnic cleansing in Asia","Forced migration in the Soviet Union","Korean migration","Korea\u2013Soviet Union relations","Political repression in the Soviet Union","Racism in the Soviet Union"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What was the deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union?  \nA1: The deportation of Koreans refers to the forced relocation of ethnic Koreans from the Soviet Far East to Central Asia in the 1930s. This was part of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's policies to address perceived security threats. It affected tens of thousands of people, primarily those who had settled in the region during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nQ2: When and where did this deportation occur?  \nA2: The main deportations took place in 1937, with some actions extending into 1938. They primarily involved Koreans living in the Russian Far East, such as the Primorsky Krai region, who were then sent to remote areas in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.\n\nQ3: Why did the Soviet government initiate this deportation?  \nA3: The Soviet authorities viewed ethnic Koreans as potential spies or sympathizers with Japan, especially amid rising tensions between the Soviet Union and Japan in the 1930s. This suspicion was fueled by Japan's imperial expansion in Asia and the proximity of Korean communities to the border. It aligned with broader Stalinist purges aimed at eliminating perceived internal threats.\n\nQ4: How was the deportation carried out?  \nA4: Soviet officials conducted mass arrests and forced evictions, transporting people via trains under harsh conditions. Families were given little notice and minimal resources, leading to significant hardship during the journey. The operation was organized by the NKVD, the Soviet secret police, as part of a systematic campaign.\n\nQ5: What were the immediate effects on the Korean population?  \nA5: Many Koreans faced starvation, disease, and death during the relocation due to overcrowded trains and inadequate supplies. Communities were disrupted, with families separated and livelihoods destroyed. This event caused immediate trauma and loss of property for those affected.\n\nQ6: What long-term impacts did the deportation have on Koreans?  \nA6: Deported Koreans struggled to adapt to new environments in Central Asia, facing discrimination and economic challenges for generations. It contributed to the erosion of Korean cultural identity in the Soviet Union, as communities were scattered. Some descendants later advocated for recognition and compensation from the Russian government.\n\nQ7: How has this event been documented and remembered?  \nA7: Historical records from Soviet archives and survivor testimonies provide evidence of the deportation, often highlighting it as an example of ethnic cleansing. In modern Russia and South Korea, it is commemorated through memorials and academic studies, raising awareness of Stalin-era repressions. International historians compare it to other forced migrations in the 20th century.\n\nQ8: What broader lessons can be drawn from this historical event?  \nA8: The deportation underscores the dangers of state-driven xenophobia and the human cost of authoritarian policies. It highlights how ethnic minorities can be targeted during geopolitical conflicts, emphasizing the need for protections against such abuses. Today, it serves as a cautionary tale for addressing migration and human rights in multicultural societies."}

He initially distributed propaganda for the Social Democratic Labor Party, before affiliating with his home town's local anarcho-communist group: the Union of Poor Peasants. Despite the political climate of increased political repression against revolutionaries, the Union continued to meet weekly and inspired Makhno to devote himself to the revolution. Makhno was initially distrusted by other members of the group, due to his apparent penchant for drinking and getting into fights. But after six months in the Union of Poor Peasants, Makhno had thoroughly educated himself on the principles of libertarian communism and became a formal member.\n\nFollowing a series of agrarian reforms, which disempowered the traditional peasant communes through the creation of a wealthier land-owning class and resulted in the growth of private estates, the Union of Poor Peasants initiated a campaign of \"Black Terror\" against the large landowners and the local Tsarist police. The group carried out a series of expropriations against local businessmen, using the money they stole to print propaganda that attacked the recent reforms. Suspected of being involved in these attacks, Makhno was arrested in September 1907 but was eventually released without charges due to a lack of evidence. As the rest of the group's members had been outlawed, Makhno founded another anarchist study group in a neighboring village, where two dozen members gathered on a weekly basis to discuss anarchist theory. But after the assassination of a police informant by the Union of Poor Peasants, the police launched a crackdown against the anarchist group and arrested many of its members, including Makhno himself in August 1909.\n\n","h_score":1855088.33125,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":306428,"revid":1173452282,"description":"Ukrainian anarchist revolutionary (1888\u20131934)","categories":["1888 births","1934 deaths","19th-century Ukrainian people","19th-century atheists","20th-century Ukrainian people","20th-century atheists","20th-century deaths from tuberculosis","Anarchist theorists","Anarcho-communists","Anti-Stalinist left","Anti-imperialism in Europe","Anti-monarchists","Burials at P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery","Carpenters","Community activists","Former Russian Orthodox Christians","Guerrilla warfare theorists","Insurrectionary anarchists","Makhnovshchina","Military leaders of the Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine","People from Alexandrovsky Uyezd (Yekaterinoslav Governorate)","People from Huliaipole","People of Cossack descent","People of the Russian Civil War","People of the Russian Revolution","Prisoners and detainees of Poland","Prisoners and detainees of Russia","Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Russia","Social anarchists","Soviet anarchists","Soviet emigrants to France","Soviet emigrants to Poland","Soviet emigrants to Romania","Soviet military personnel of the Russian Civil War","Soviet people of the Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War","Tuberculosis deaths in France","Ukrainian Cossacks","Ukrainian agrarianists","Ukrainian anarchists","Ukrainian anti-capitalists","Ukrainian atheists","Ukrainian communists","Ukrainian dissidents","Ukrainian emigrants to France","Ukrainian emigrants to Romania","Ukrainian guerrillas","Ukrainian male writers","Ukrainian military leaders","Ukrainian people imprisoned abroad","Ukrainian people of the Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War","Ukrainian prisoners and detainees","Ukrainian rebels","Ukrainian refugees","Ukrainian revolutionaries","Ukrainian socialists","Ukrainian trade unionists","Ukrainian writers in Russian"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Nestor Makhno: The Anarchist Whirlwind That Upended Empires\n\nIn the fiery chaos of the Russian Civil War, Nestor Makhno emerged as a charismatic Ukrainian peasant leader who commanded a ragtag army of rebels fighting for land, liberty, and a world without rulers.

After solving a riddle his father has left, Yuri finds his father's token, a half of a sword. He goes to Goguryeo and meets Jumong. Yuri and Jumong match their halves of the sword, and the sword becomes one while oozing blood. When Jumong asks his son to show his power, the boy rides atop sunlight. Jumong then makes Yuri his heir. In 19 BCE, the king ascends into heaven and does not return. Yuri holds a funeral for his father, using the king's whip in place of his missing body, and becomes Goguryeo's second king. The foundation of the southwestern kingdom of Baekje is also linked to the Jumong myth. According to the Samguk sagi, when Yuri is made heir, Jumong's two sons by a local wife are excluded from the kingship. These two brothers, Biryu and Onjo, migrate south to found their own kingdoms. Biryu sets up court in an unfavorable place, while Onjo founds Baekje in good terrain in what is now southern Seoul. The former dies of shame when he learns that his brother's kingdom is flourishing, and the remnants of his people join Baekje. The myth of Jumong is of the northern type, with Haemosu as the celestial father and Yuhwa as the earthly woman. Contemporaneous Chinese sources report that Jumong and Yuhwa were both actively worshipped as gods by the Goguryeo people, including in rituals involving shamans. Like the Dangun myth, the story is also subject to euhemerized interpretations. For instance, Seo Daeseok argues that Haemosu symbolizes an ancient iron-using, agricultural sun-worshipping people, that Yuhwa was a member of a riverine group of hunters, farmers, and fishermen, and that Geumwa's polity centered on hunting and pastoralism. The Jumong myth is first attested in the fifth-century Gwanggaeto Stele, but the first-century Chinese text Lunheng describes a barbarian tale of a good archer who crosses a river on the backs of fish and turtles to found a new kingdom in the south. However, this figure's mother is a slave-girl impregnated by an egg-like energy rather than a goddess who gives birth to a physical egg, and the figure himself founds the kingdom of Buyeo, rather than that of Goguryeo. The Goguryeo foundation myth thus incorporates the myths of Haemosu and Yuri and the Buyeo foundation myth into a single narrative. #### Southern kingdoms\n\n","h_score":1840013.9125000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":328868,"revid":1169745351,"description":null,"categories":["History of Korea","History of Northeast Asia","Korean folklore","Korean mythology"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Korean mythology?  \nA1: Korean mythology refers to the traditional stories, beliefs, and legends of ancient Korea, drawing from shamanistic practices, folklore, and early historical texts.

Part of the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, the city lies in the Salt Lake Valley along the banks of the Jordan River between the 10,000-foot (3,000 m) Oquirrh Mountains and the 11,000-foot (3,400 m) Wasatch Mountains. The city has 3.5 miles (5.6 km) of the Jordan River Parkway that contains fishing ponds, trails, parks, and natural habitats. The Salt Lake County fair grounds and equestrian park, 67-acre (27 ha) Oquirrh Lake, and 37 public parks are located inside the city. As of 2020, there were 77,487 people in South Jordan.\n\nFounded in 1859 by Mormon settlers and historically an agrarian town, South Jordan has become a rapidly growing bedroom community of Salt Lake City. Kennecott Land, a land development company, has recently begun construction on the master-planned Daybreak Community for the entire western half of South Jordan, potentially doubling South Jordan's population. South Jordan was the first municipality in the world to have two temples of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Jordan River Utah Temple and Oquirrh Mountain Utah Temple), it now shares that distinction with Provo, Utah. The city has two TRAX light rail stops, as well as one commuter rail stop on the FrontRunner.\n\n ## History\n\n ### Pre-European\n\nThe first known inhabitants were members of the Desert Archaic Culture who were nomadic hunter-gatherers. From 400 A.D. to around 1350 A.D., the Fremont people settled into villages and farmed corn and squash. Changes in climatic conditions to a cooler, drier period and the movement into the area of ancestors of the Ute, Paiute, and Shoshone, led to the disappearance of the Fremont people. When European settlers arrived, there were no permanent Native American settlements in the Salt Lake Valley, but the area bordered several tribes \u2013 the territory of the Northwestern Shoshone to the north, the Timpanogots band of the Utes to the south in Utah Valley, and the Goshutes to the west in Tooele Valley.\n\nThe only recorded trapper to lead a party through the area was \u00c9tienne Provost, a French Canadian. In October 1824, Provost's party was lured into an Indian camp somewhere along the Jordan River north of Utah Lake. The people responsible for the attack were planning revenge against Provost's party for an earlier unexplained incident involving other trappers. Provost escaped, but his men were caught off-guard and fifteen of them were killed.\n\n","h_score":1787453.2625000002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":137069,"revid":1165902249,"description":"City in Salt Lake County, Utah, United States","categories":["1859 establishments in Utah Territory","Cities in Salt Lake County, Utah","Cities in Utah","Populated places established in 1859","Salt Lake City metropolitan area","South Jordan, Utah","Wasatch Front"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is South Jordan, Utah?  \nA1: South Jordan is a city in the U.S. state of Utah, located in Salt Lake County.

In 1699 the estates, including Steep Holm, were sold to Philip Freke of Bristol, whose descendants held it for the next 130 years. Freke's granddaughter married into the family of John Willes, who was Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas and Member of Parliament. During their ownership, probably around 1776, a new cottage was built on Steep Holm for fishermen. It was built using stones from the ruined priory. In 1830 the island was sold again, according to some sources this was to a cousin of John Freke Willes named William Willes; however, other sources suggest it was to a solicitor in Weston-super-Mare named John Baker. In 1832 the island was leased to Colonel Tynte of Halswell House, who established an inn for sailors. The inn was run by the Harris family, using rum and tobacco bought from ships. They claimed that the island was outside the jurisdiction of the excise men until a court case in 1884. After the Harris family, the inn was run by Mr W. L. Davies, who offered fishing, shooting and boating holidays. To make landing on the island easier, a new pier was built close to the inn. In 1835 clergyman John Ashley from Clevedon voluntarily ministered to the population of the island and the neighbouring Flat Holm. Ashley created the Bristol Channel Mission in order to serve seafarers on the 400 sailing vessels which used the Bristol Channel. The mission would later become the Mission to Seafarers, which still provides ministerial services to sailors in over 300 ports.","h_score":1754989.9625000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":635181,"revid":1165233647,"description":"Island in the Bristol Channel, United Kingdom","categories":["Hills of Somerset","Islands of England","Islands of the Bristol Channel","Ports and harbours of the Bristol Channel","Scheduled monuments in North Somerset","Sites of Special Scientific Interest in North Somerset","Sites of Special Scientific Interest notified in 1952","Weston-super-Mare"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Steep Holm: A Rugged Island Jewel in the Bristol Channel\n\nAmidst the swirling tides of the Bristol Channel lies Steep Holm, a compact island brimming with natural beauty and historical intrigue.

The Jones has 1,092 seats across three levels and is operated by the Shubert Organization. Both the facade and interior of the theater are New York City designated landmarks.\n\nThe theater maintains much of its original neoclassical design. Its 48th Street facade has a glass-and-metal marquee shielding the entrances, as well as a colonnade with an additional story above. The lobby has marble paneling and a coved ceiling.

Despite being regarded by the theatrical community as being on the \"wrong side\" of Broadway, the Cort hosted numerous hit productions during its early years. The Shubert Organization purchased the theater in 1927, two years before Cort's death. Though the theater was used as a television studio for The Merv Griffin Show from 1969 to 1972, it has mostly remained in theatrical use through the years.

He was additionally a lifelong member and secretary of the Kildare Knot, a dining club made up of wealthy individuals regardless of religion. During his tenure, the Knot was involved with the Irish Volunteers, a patriotic militia group dedicated to defending Ireland from potential French invaders. Guinness's primary political positions, however, concerned the rights of Catholics to fully participate in Irish politics and society. In addition to personally hiring Catholics for his brewery, and by accounts treating them fairly, Guinness advocated to overturn laws that restricted the ability of Catholics to enter certain professions, and as a member of the Royal Dublin Society, he argued for economic developments that would positively affect lower-class Catholics in agriculture and domestic industry. He was opposed, however, to the Irish Rebellion of 1798, an uprising of Presbyterian radicals who wished to overthrow British rule in Ireland. Guinness disliked both the economic disruption that the rebellion brought, as well as the violence it incurred. His son John was wounded in the fighting, further incurring the Guinness family's disapproval. Guinness's opposition to the rebellion garnered the ire of Irish Catholics and nationalists, who subsequently referred to his beer as his \"black Protestant porter\".\n\nGuinness was a deeply religious man whose personal motto was Spes Mea in Deo, Latin for \"My Hope is in God\". Although he never converted to Methodism during his life, instead remaining a member of the Church of Ireland, his diaries indicate that his faith was influenced by that of John Wesley and the Methodist model of evangelical social work. He served as treasurer and later Governor of Meath Hospital and frequently donated money to St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. Another religious inspiration for Guinness was Robert Raikes, who promoted Sunday school as a method of eliminating crime by introducing faith and morals early in life. In 1786, Guinness opened the first Sunday school in Dublin.\n\nMany of Guinness's social positions were based in his beliefs of temperance and moderation. He believed that the duty of the wealthy and powerful was to set a strong moral example for their citizenry and looked unfavorably on what he viewed as displays of excess. He once protested the traditional feast of a new alderman, worried that the occasion would lead to drunken impropriety, and instead suggested that the money set aside for the banquet be donated to The King's Hospital. Guinness's investment in penal reform similarly stemmed from his displeasure towards what he believed was excess punishment towards criminals. He was particularly opposed to the culture of dueling among the Irish elite, which he viewed as a deadly sport masquerading as honour, but his efforts to eliminate or reduce dueling were unsuccessful. Despite his generally temperate positions, Guinness never ventured into the teetotalism movement, instead joining the belief of his fellow brewers that drunkenness was attributed to liquor, not to beer.\n\n","h_score":1799447.53125,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1762813,"revid":1173480768,"description":"Irish brewer (1725\u20131803)","categories":["1725 births","1803 deaths","18th-century Anglo-Irish people","18th-century Irish businesspeople","Guinness family","Irish Anglicans","Irish brewers","People from Celbridge"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Arthur Guinness?  \nA1: Arthur Guinness was an 18th-century Irish entrepreneur and brewer, best known as the founder of the iconic Guinness brewery.

Rib\u00e9ry was given the number 7 shirt, which was freed up due to the retirement of midfielder Mehmet Scholl at the end of the previous season. He made his team debut one month later, scoring twice in an 18\u20130 friendly drubbing of Munich youth side FT Gern. Rib\u00e9ry made his competitive debut for Bayern on 21 July 2007 against Werder Bremen in the first round of the Premiere Ligapokal, scoring twice and also assisting on another in a 4\u20131 victory. In the semifinals, he netted an early goal in a 2\u20130 win over defending champions VfB Stuttgart. Due to an injury, Rib\u00e9ry was unable to play in the final, which Bayern won.\n\nRib\u00e9ry scored his first league goal for the club on 18 August in a 4\u20130 triumph over Bremen converting a penalty in the 31st minute. He went scoreless in the league for almost two months before scoring a goal and providing the assist on Bayern's other goal in a 2\u20131 win over VfL Bochum. A month later, Rib\u00e9ry recorded this feat again, providing the assist on the opening goal scored by Miroslav Klose and scoring the game winning goal in a 2\u20131 win over VfL Wolfsburg. In the German Cup, he recorded two goals and provided four assists in five matches Bayern contested. He netted his first goal in the competition on 27 February 2008 in Bayern's win over inner-city rivals 1860 Munich, with Rib\u00e9ry converting the lone goal, a penalty, in the final minute of extra time. In the semi-finals, Rib\u00e9ry scored the opening goal in Bayern's 2\u20130 win over Wolfsburg, which resulted in the club qualifying for the final against Borussia Dortmund. In the DFB-Pokal final, Rib\u00e9ry assisted on Luca Toni's opener in the 11th minute in a match Bayern won 2\u20131, thus claiming their 14th cup title.\n\nIn the UEFA Cup, Bayern reached the semi-finals, with Rib\u00e9ry scoring three goals in the competition, including one in the Germans' comeback win over Spanish club Getafe in the quarter-finals. In total, Rib\u00e9ry appeared in 46 matches scoring 16 goals and assisting on 17 goals as Bayern won the league and cup double. For his efforts, on 8 June 2008, Rib\u00e9ry was named the 2007\u201308 Footballer of the Year (Germany). He was also named French Player of the Year for the second consecutive season.\n\n","h_score":1805574.8062500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":3002912,"revid":1170341044,"description":"French footballer (born 1983)","categories":["1983 births","2006 FIFA World Cup players","2010 FIFA World Cup players","ACF Fiorentina players","Bundesliga players","Championnat National 2 players","Championnat National players","Converts to Islam","Expatriate men's footballers in Germany","Expatriate men's footballers in Italy","Expatriate men's footballers in Turkey","FC Bayern Munich footballers","FC Metz players","Footballers from Pas-de-Calais","France men's international footballers","France men's under-21 international footballers","French Muslims","French expatriate men's footballers","French expatriate sportspeople in Germany","French expatriate sportspeople in Italy","French expatriate sportspeople in Turkey","French men's footballers","Galatasaray S.K. footballers","Ligue 1 players","Living people","Men's association football wingers","Olympique Al\u00e8s players","Olympique de Marseille players","People from Boulogne-sur-Mer","Serie A players","Stade Brestois 29 players","S\u00fcper Lig players","UEFA Champions League winning players","UEFA Euro 2008 players","UEFA Euro 2012 players","UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award winners","US Boulogne players","US Salernitana 1919 players"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Franck Rib\u00e9ry?  \nA1: Franck Rib\u00e9ry is a French football legend, a pint-sized dynamo who electrified pitches worldwide with his fearless dribbles and unbridled passion.

Toll met Malick in September of the same year and was asked to do the film in the beginning of 1997. Malick and Toll began location scouting in February 1997 and started principal photography in June of that year.\n\nPre-production went slowly. Weeks before filming began, Malick told Geisler and Roberdeau not to show up in Australia where the film was being made, ostensibly because George Stevens Jr. would be the on-location producer supporting line producer Grant Hill. Malick told them that they had upset the studio for refusing to give up above-the-title production credit to Stevens. He did not tell them that in 1996 he had a clause inserted in his contract barring the producers from the set. Geisler and Roberdeau were mystified about this behavior; Geisler told Entertainment Weekly, \"I didn't think he was capable of betrayal of this magnitude.\"\n\nMalick and Toll shot for 100 days in Australia using Panavision cameras and lenses, 24 days in the Solomon Islands and three days in the United States. They scouted the historic battlefields on Guadalcanal and shot footage, but health concerns over malaria limited filming to daylight hours only. Logistics were also difficult to shoot the entire film there: As director of photography John Toll put it, \"It's still a bit difficult to get on and off the island, and we had some scenes that involved 200 or 300 extras. We would have had to bring everybody to Guadalcanal, and financially it just didn't make sense.\" The Thin Red Line was filmed predominantly in the Daintree Rainforest and on Bramston Beach, both in north Queensland, Australia. Filming also took place on Dancer Mountain, which had such rough terrain that trailers and production trucks could not make it up the hill. A base camp was set up and roads carved out of the mountain. Transporting 250 actors and 200 crew members up the hill took two hours. Filming took place in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California near Santa Catalina Island.\n\nMalick's unconventional filming techniques included shooting part of a scene during a bright, sunny morning only to finish it weeks later at sunset. He made a habit of pointing the camera away during an action sequence and focus on a parrot, a tree branch or other fauna. Malick's reputation and working methods commanded great respect among the actors, with both Woody Harrelson and John Savage staying on for an extra month after they finished all of their scenes just to watch him at work.\n\n","h_score":1807275.175,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":142465,"revid":1173743801,"description":"1998 film by Terrence Malick","categories":["1990s American films","1990s English-language films","1990s war drama films","1998 drama films","1998 films","20th Century Fox films","American World War II films","American historical adventure films","American war adventure films","American war drama films","American war epic films","Anti-war films about World War II","Films about deserters","Films about the United States Army","Films based on American novels","Films directed by Terrence Malick","Films produced by Grant Hill (producer)","Films scored by Hans Zimmer","Films set in 1942","Films set in the Solomon Islands","Films shot in Los Angeles","Films shot in New South Wales","Films shot in Queensland","Films shot in the Solomon Islands","Golden Bear winners","Guadalcanal Campaign","Pacific War films","Phoenix Pictures films","War epic films"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Terrence Malick's War Epic: The Thin Red Line at 25\n\nIn the lush chaos of World War II's Pacific theater, Terrence Malick's 1998 film \"The Thin Red Line\" weaves a poetic tapestry of violence and introspection, adapting James Jones' novel to explore the human soul amid jungle warfare. This critically acclaimed masterpiece not only boasts a stellar ensemble cast but also challenges viewers with its meditative pace and profound questions about nature, morality, and existence.\n\n#### A Jungle of Souls and Shadows\nPicture soldiers as fleeting shadows in a verdant abyss, where bullets whisper through palm fronds and the earth itself seems to mourn. The film follows a group of American troops on Guadalcanal, delving into Private Witt's desertion and return, blending brutal combat with ethereal voiceovers that paint war as a cosmic fever dream rather than mere heroism.\n\n#### Stellar Cast and Cinematic Alchemy\nWith A-listers like Sean Penn and Nick Nolte bringing raw intensity to the screen, Malick transforms a war story into a visual symphony. As Penn once reflected, \"It's not about the fight; it's about what the fight reveals in us,\" capturing the film's unexpected depth that elevates ensemble performances into profound character studies.\n\n#### Critical Echoes and Cultural Ripples\nCritics hailed it as a bold departure from traditional war films, with Roger Ebert calling it \"a movie of great beauty and sorrow,\" though some lamented its meandering narrative. Despite mixed initial box office results, the film's philosophical undertones have sparked ongoing debates in film studies and veterans' circles, resonating with themes of trauma and redemption.\n\nLooking ahead, as modern conflicts unfold, \"The Thin Red Line\" may inspire a new generation to question the thin veil between civilization and savagery."}

Golden, not aimed at conquest. Rather, Golden writes, they were \"typical of nomads testing the defenses of their sedentary neighbors\" and a means of gathering booty, the acquisition and distribution of which was fundamental to tribal coalitions. According to Golden, for the Khazars the strategic stake of the conflict was control of the Caucasus passes. Albania was probably regarded by the Khazars as rightfully theirs, a legacy of the last Byzantine\u2013Sasanian war. According to historian Bori Zhivkov, \"It is no surprise that they fought fiercely with the Arabs precisely for these lands up to the 730s\".\n\nThe sources do not provide details of the composition or tactics of Khazar armies, and the names of Khazar commanders are rarely recorded. Although the Khazars adopted elements of the civilizations to their south and possessed towns, they remained a tribal, semi-nomadic power. Like other steppe societies originating in Central Asia, they practised a mobile form of warfare and relied on skilled, hardy cavalry. The rapid movements and sudden attacks and counterattacks of the Khazar cavalry are emphasized in the sources; in the few detailed descriptions of pitched battles, the Khazar cavalry launched the opening attacks. Heavy (cataphract) cavalry is not recorded, but archaeological evidence attests to the use of heavy armour for riders and (possibly) horses. The presence of Khazar infantry must be assumed (especially during siege operations), although it is not explicitly mentioned. Modern historians point to the use of advanced siege machines to indicate that Khazar military sophistication was equal to that of other contemporary armies. The less-rigidly-organized, semi-nomadic nature of the Khazar state also worked to their advantage against the Arabs; they lacked a permanent administrative centre, whose loss would paralyze the government and force them to surrender.\n\nThe Khazar army was composed of Khazar troops and those of vassal princes and allies. Its overall size is unclear, and references to 300,000 men in the invasion of 730 are clearly exaggerated. Historian Igor Semyonov observes that the Khazars \"never entered into battle without having a numerical advantage\" over their Arab opponents, which often forced the latter to withdraw. According to Semyonov, this attests to the Khazars' skill in logistics and their ability to gather accurate information about their opponents' movements, the layout of the country, and the condition of roads.\n\n","h_score":1930519.5625,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":6225891,"revid":1173433211,"description":"Series of wars between the Arabs and Khazars over control of the Caucasus","categories":["7th-century conflicts","8th-century conflicts","Arab\u2013Khazar wars","Medieval history of the Caucasus"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What were the Arab\u2013Khazar wars?  \nA1: The Arab\u2013Khazar wars were a series of military conflicts in the 7th and 8th centuries between the expanding Arab Caliphate and the Khazar Khaganate, a powerful Turkic empire in the Caucasus. These clashes involved raids, sieges, and strategic maneuvers over trade routes and borders. Picture them as epic struggles for dominance in a crossroads of ancient worlds.\n\nQ2: Who were the main parties involved?  \nA2: The primary combatants were the Arab Caliphate, led by Muslim armies from the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties, and the Khazar Khaganate, a federation of Turkic and other nomadic peoples ruled by a khagan. The Khazars were known for their cavalry prowess and defensive fortifications, while the Arabs brought disciplined infantry and religious zeal. This matchup blended cultural might with battlefield ingenuity.\n\nQ3: When did these wars occur?  \nA3: The conflicts primarily unfolded from the mid-7th century to the early 8th century, with major escalations around 642 to 737 AD. Sporadic fighting continued for decades afterward as tensions lingered. Think of this era as a turbulent chapter in medieval history, where time itself seemed to march to the beat of clashing empires.\n\nQ4: Where did the battles take place?  \nA4: The wars were fought mainly in the Caucasus region, including areas like the Caspian Sea shores, the Derbent Pass, and parts of modern-day Azerbaijan, Dagestan, and Georgia. These rugged landscapes, with their mountains and steppes, served as natural battlegrounds that amplified the drama of the fights. It was a theater of war where terrain often tipped the scales.\n\nQ5: What caused the Arab\u2013Khazar wars?  \nA5: The wars stemmed from territorial disputes, as the Arab Caliphate expanded northward seeking control of lucrative Silk Road trade routes, while the Khazars defended their homeland and allies. Religious differences also played a role, with the Muslim Arabs clashing against the polytheistic or Jewish-influenced Khazars. Like a storm brewing over prized treasures, these factors ignited repeated confrontations.\n\nQ6: What were the key events or battles?  \nA6: Notable events include the Arab siege of Derbent in 642, which opened the Caucasus front, and the decisive Battle of Ardabil in 730, where Khazar forces dealt a major blow to Arab invaders. Another highlight was the Khazars' alliance with Byzantines, leading to counter-raids that pushed back Arab advances. These moments unfolded like chapters in a gripping saga of resilience and strategy.\n\nQ7: What was the outcome of the wars?  \nA7: The Khazars ultimately repelled the Arab invasions, securing their territory and maintaining independence until later declines. However, the wars weakened both sides, with the Arabs shifting focus elsewhere and the Khazars facing internal strife. It was a hard-won stalemate that reshaped regional power dynamics like ripples from a stone in a pond.\n\nQ8: How did these wars impact history?  \nA8: The Arab\u2013Khazar wars helped preserve the Khazar state as a buffer against Islamic expansion, influencing the spread of religions and cultures in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. They also highlighted early interactions between nomadic and settled societies, affecting trade and migration patterns for centuries. In the grand tapestry of history, these conflicts wove threads of enduring geopolitical change."}

Here Chiang insisted fervently on mounting a sustained defense of Nanjing. Chiang argued, just as he had during the Battle of Shanghai, that China would be more likely to receive aid from the great powers, possibly at the ongoing Nine Power Treaty Conference, if it could prove on the battlefield its will and capacity to resist the Japanese. He also noted that holding onto Nanjing would strengthen China's hand in peace talks which he wanted the German ambassador Oskar Trautmann to mediate.\n\nChiang ran into stiff opposition from his officers, including the powerful Chief of Staff of the Military Affairs Commission He Yingqin, the Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi, the head of the Fifth War Zone Li Zongren, and his German advisor Alexander von Falkenhausen. They argued that the Chinese Army needed more time to recover from its losses at Shanghai, and pointed out that Nanjing was highly indefensible topographically. The mostly gently sloping terrain in front of Nanjing would make it easy for the attackers to advance on the city, while the Yangtze River behind Nanjing would cut off the defenders' retreat.\n\nChiang, however, had become increasingly agitated over the course of the Battle of Shanghai, even angrily declaring that he would stay behind in Nanjing alone and command its defense personally. But just when Chiang believed himself completely isolated, General Tang Shengzhi, an ambitious senior member of the Military Affairs Commission, spoke out in defense of Chiang's position, although accounts vary on whether Tang vociferously jumped to Chiang's aid or only reluctantly did so. Seizing the opportunity Tang had given him, Chiang responded by organizing the Nanjing Garrison Force on November 20 and officially making Tang its commander on November 25. The orders Tang received from Chiang on November 30 were to \"defend the established defense lines at any cost and destroy the enemy\u2019s besieging force\".\n\nThough both men publicly declared that they would defend Nanjing \"to the last man\", they were aware of their precarious situation. On the same day that the Garrison Force was established Chiang officially moved the capital of China from Nanjing to Chongqing deep in China's interior. Further, both Chiang and Tang would at times give contradictory instructions to their subordinates on whether their mission was to defend Nanjing to the death or merely delay the Japanese advance.\n\n ## Road to Nanjing\n\n","h_score":2152104.8000000003,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":65712,"revid":1163409481,"description":"1937 Second Sino-Japanese War battle","categories":["1937 in China","1937 in Japan","Articles containing video clips","Battles of the Second Sino-Japanese War","Conflicts in 1937","History of Nanjing"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What was the Battle of Nanking?  \nA1: The Battle of Nanking was a brutal clash in 1937 during the Second Sino-Japanese War, marking Japan's invasion of China's capital city.

This event set the stage for one of history's darkest chapters, blending military strategy with human tragedy.\n\nQ2: When and where did it take place?  \nA2: It occurred in December 1937, centered on the city of Nanking (now Nanjing) in eastern China, a once-vibrant riverside hub.

Picture silk-clad soldiers clashing amid modern machine guns, a stark collision of old and new worlds.\n\nQ3: Who were the main forces involved?  \nA3: The primary combatants were the Imperial Japanese Army, known for their disciplined and aggressive tactics, against the outnumbered Nationalist forces of the Republic of China. Japanese commanders like General Matsui Iwane led the assault, while Chinese General Tang Shengzhi desperately coordinated defenses. It was a David-and-Goliath showdown, with Japan's industrial might facing China's resilient spirit.\n\nQ4: What were the key events during the battle?  \nA4: The conflict began with aerial bombings and amphibious landings, escalating to fierce urban combat as Japanese troops breached the city's defenses. Chinese forces mounted a valiant but futile resistance, including booby-trapped streets and last-stand fights. Ultimately, Nanking's fall opened the door to widespread atrocities, etching the event into history's grim tapestry.\n\nQ5: What caused the Battle of Nanking?  \nA5: It stemmed from Japan's imperial ambitions in Asia, fueled by resource needs and territorial expansion after earlier conflicts like the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. Tensions had simmered for years, with China's internal divisions weakening its response to Japanese aggression. Think of it as a powder keg ignited by global rivalries, exploding into local horror.\n\nQ6: How did it impact the local population?  \nA6: The battle and its aftermath devastated Nanking's civilians, leading to mass killings, rapes, and displacements in what became known as the Nanjing Massacre. Estimates suggest hundreds of thousands perished, shattering families and communities in a wave of unchecked violence. This human toll transformed a proud city into a symbol of wartime savagery, like a shattered porcelain vase never fully mended.\n\nQ7: What was its broader historical significance?  \nA7: The Battle of Nanking highlighted the early horrors of World War II in Asia, galvanizing international outrage and influencing events like the formation of the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone. It exposed the limits of global diplomacy and accelerated alliances against Japan. In retrospect, it's a vivid mirror reflecting the era's moral abyss, where humanity's darker impulses clashed with fleeting acts of courage.\n\nQ8: What lessons can we draw from it today?  \nA8: It reminds us of the perils of unchecked aggression and the need for swift international intervention in conflicts. The event underscores how civilian protections can be ignored in war, urging modern societies to prioritize human rights and reconciliation. Like a cautionary tale whispered through time, it challenges us to build bridges instead of battlefields, ensuring history's echoes don't repeat."}

NASA defines life as \"a self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian [i.e., biological] evolution.\" Such a system is complex; the last universal common ancestor (LUCA), presumably a single-celled organism which lived some 4 billion years ago, already had hundreds of genes encoded in the DNA genetic code that is universal today. That in turn implies a suite of cellular machinery including messenger RNA, transfer RNA, and ribosomes to translate the code into proteins. Those proteins included enzymes to operate its anaerobic respiration via the Wood\u2013Ljungdahl metabolic pathway, and a DNA polymerase to replicate its genetic material.\n\nThe challenge for abiogenesis (origin of life) researchers is to explain how such a complex and tightly interlinked system could develop by evolutionary steps, as at first sight all its parts are necessary to enable it to function. For example, a cell, whether the LUCA or in a modern organism, copies its DNA with the DNA polymerase enzyme, which is in turn produced by translating the DNA polymerase gene in the DNA. Neither the enzyme nor the DNA can be produced without the other. The evolutionary process could have involved molecular self-replication, self-assembly such as of cell membranes, and autocatalysis.\n\nThe precursors to the development of a living cell like the LUCA are clear enough, if disputed in their details: a habitable world is formed with a supply of minerals and liquid water. Prebiotic synthesis creates a range of simple organic compounds, which are assembled into polymers such as proteins and RNA. The process after the LUCA, too, is readily understood: biological evolution caused the development of a wide range of species with varied forms and biochemical capabilities. The derivation of living things such as the LUCA from simple components, however, is far from understood.\n\nAlthough Earth remains the only place where life is known, the science of astrobiology seeks evidence of life on other planets. The 2015 NASA strategy on the origin of life aimed to solve the puzzle by identifying interactions, intermediary structures and functions, energy sources, and environmental factors that contributed to the diversity, selection, and replication of evolvable macromolecular systems, and mapping the chemical landscape of potential primordial informational polymers. The advent of polymers that could replicate, store genetic information, and exhibit properties subject to selection was, it suggested, most likely a critical step in the emergence of prebiotic chemical evolution. Those polymers derived, in turn, from simple organic compounds such as nucleobases, amino acids, and sugars that could have been formed by reactions in the environment. A successful theory of the origin of life must explain how all these chemicals came into being.\n\n ## Conceptual history until the 1960s\n\n ### Spontaneous generation\n\nOne ancient view of the origin of life, from Aristotle until the 19th century, is of spontaneous generation. This theory held that \"lower\" animals were generated by decaying organic substances, and that life arose by chance. This was questioned from the 17th century, in works like Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica. In 1665, Robert Hooke published the first drawings of a microorganism. In 1676, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek drew and described microorganisms, probably protozoa and bacteria. Van Leeuwenhoek disagreed with spontaneous generation, and by the 1680s convinced himself, using experiments ranging from sealed and open meat incubation and the close study of insect reproduction, that the theory was incorrect. In 1668 Francesco Redi showed that no maggots appeared in meat when flies were prevented from laying eggs. By the middle of the 19th century, spontaneous generation was considered disproven.\n\n ### Panspermia\n\nAnother ancient idea dating back to Anaxagoras in the 5th century BC is panspermia, the idea that life exists throughout the universe, distributed by meteoroids, asteroids, comets and planetoids. It does not attempt to explain how life originated in itself, but shifts the origin of life on Earth to another heavenly body. The advantage is that life is not required to have formed on each planet it occurs on, but rather in a more limited set of locations (potentially even a single location), and then spread about the galaxy to other star systems via cometary or meteorite impact.\n\n ### \"A warm little pond\": primordial soup\n\nThe idea that life originated from non-living matter in slow stages appeared in Herbert Spencer's 1864\u20131867 book Principles of Biology, and in William Turner Thiselton-Dyer's 1879 paper \"On spontaneous generation and evolution\". On 1 February 1871 Charles Darwin wrote about these publications to Joseph Hooker, and set out his own speculation, suggesting that the original spark of life may have begun in a \"warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity, &c., present, that a proteine compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes.\" Darwin went on to explain that \"at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed.\"\n\nAlexander Oparin in 1924 and J. B. S. Haldane in 1929 proposed that the first molecules constituting the earliest cells slowly self-organized from a primordial soup, and this theory is called the Oparin\u2013Haldane hypothesis. Haldane suggested that the Earth's prebiotic oceans consisted of a \"hot dilute soup\" in which organic compounds could have formed. J. D. Bernal showed that such mechanisms could form most of the necessary molecules for life from inorganic precursors. In 1967, he suggested three \"stages\": the origin of biological monomers; the origin of biological polymers; and the evolution from molecules to cells.\n\n ### Miller\u2013Urey experiment\n\nIn 1952, Stanley Miller and Harold Urey carried out a chemical experiment to demonstrate how organic molecules could have formed spontaneously from inorganic precursors under prebiotic conditions like those posited by the Oparin\u2013Haldane hypothesis. It used a highly reducing (lacking oxygen) mixture of gases\u2014methane, ammonia, and hydrogen, as well as water vapor\u2014to form simple organic monomers such as amino acids. Bernal said of the Miller\u2013Urey experiment that \"it is not enough to explain the formation of such molecules, what is necessary, is a physical-chemical explanation of the origins of these molecules that suggests the presence of suitable sources and sinks for free energy.\" However, current scientific consensus describes the primitive atmosphere as weakly reducing or neutral, diminishing the amount and variety of amino acids that could be produced. The addition of iron and carbonate minerals, present in early oceans, however, produces a diverse array of amino acids. Later work has focused on two other potential reducing environments: outer space and deep-sea hydrothermal vents.\n\n ## Producing a habitable Earth\n\n ### Evolutionary history\n\n #### Early universe with first stars\n\nSoon after the Big Bang, which occurred roughly 14 Gya, the only chemical elements present in the universe were hydrogen, helium, and lithium, the three lightest atoms in the periodic table. These elements gradually came together to form stars. These early stars were massive and short-lived, producing all the heavier elements through stellar nucleosynthesis. Carbon, currently the fourth most abundant chemical element in the universe (after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen), was formed mainly in white dwarf stars, particularly those bigger than twice the mass of the sun. As these stars reached the end of their lifecycles, they ejected these heavier elements, among them carbon and oxygen, throughout the universe. These heavier elements allowed for the formation of new objects, including rocky planets and other bodies. According to the nebular hypothesis, the formation and evolution of the Solar System began 4.6 Gya with the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud. Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.\n\n","h_score":2045274.4875,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":19179706,"revid":1173366405,"description":"Natural process by which life arises from non-living matter","categories":["Astrobiology","Beginnings","Evolutionarily significant biological phenomena","Evolutionary biology","Global events","Natural events","Origin of life","Origins","Prebiotic chemistry"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Unraveling Abiogenesis: The Science of Life's Origins\n\nAbiogenesis is the process by which life emerges from non-living matter, explaining how the first living organisms might have formed on early Earth. Scientists have used experiments and geological evidence to explore this concept, though debates persist about the exact mechanisms involved.\n\n#### What is Abiogenesis?\nAbiogenesis refers to the hypothesis that life arose spontaneously from inorganic compounds under the right conditions, such as in ancient oceans or hydrothermal vents. This idea dates back to the 19th century and contrasts with theories of life arriving from elsewhere, like panspermia. Early proponents, including Charles Darwin, suggested in his letters that life could have started in a \"warm little pond,\" highlighting the role of chemical reactions in forming simple organic molecules.\n\n#### Evidence from Experiments\nKey experiments, such as the 1952 Miller-Urey test, simulated early Earth conditions and produced amino acids from gases like methane and ammonia. This demonstrated that basic building blocks of life could form naturally, supporting abiogenesis as a plausible explanation. As microbiologist Stanley Miller stated, \"The experiment showed that the synthesis of organic compounds from inorganic precursors is possible under primitive Earth conditions.\"\n\n#### Challenges and Debates\nDespite progress, challenges include explaining the transition from simple chemicals to complex, self-replicating cells, with gaps in the fossil record and questions about energy sources. Critics argue that random chemical reactions alone may not account for life's complexity, as noted by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins: \"Abiogenesis remains one of the great unsolved problems, requiring us to bridge the gap between chemistry and biology.\" Ongoing research addresses these issues through advanced simulations and astrobiology.\n\nResearchers are advancing studies with new technologies to potentially reveal how life began, offering insights into extraterrestrial possibilities."}

When a uranium-235 atom undergoes fission, it releases an average of 2.4 neutrons. In the simplest case of an unreflected, homogeneous, spherical reactor, the critical radius was calculated to be approximately: > $R_{crit} \\approx  \\frac{\\pi M}{\\sqrt{k - 1}}$, where M is the average distance that a neutron travels before it is absorbed, and k is the average neutron multiplication factor. The neutrons in succeeding reactions will be amplified by a factor k, the second generation of fission events will produce k<sup>2<\/sup>, the third k<sup>3<\/sup> and so on. In order for a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction to occur, k must be at least 3 or 4 percent greater than 1. In other words, k must be greater than 1 without crossing the prompt critical threshold that would result in a rapid, exponential increase in the number of fission events. Fermi christened his apparatus a \"pile\". Emilio Segr\u00e8 later recalled that: > I thought for a while that this term was used to refer to a source of nuclear energy in analogy with Volta's use of the Italian term pila to denote his own great invention of a source of electrical energy. I was disillusioned by Fermi himself, who told me that he simply used the common English word pile as synonymous with heap. To my surprise, Fermi never seemed to have thought of the relationship between his pile and Volta's. Another grant, this time of \\$40,000, was obtained from the S-1 Uranium Committee to purchase more materials, and in August 1941 Fermi began to plan the building of a sub-critical assembly to test with a smaller structure whether a larger one would work. The so-called exponential pile he proposed to build was 8 feet (2.4 m) long, 8 feet (2.4 m) wide and 11 feet (3.4 m) high. This was too large to fit in the Pupin Physics Laboratories. Fermi recalled that: > We went to Dean Pegram, who was then the man who could carry out magic around the University, and we explained to him that we needed a big room. He scouted around the campus and we went with him to dark corridors and under various heating pipes and so on, to visit possible sites for this experiment and eventually a big room was discovered in Schermerhorn Hall. The pile was built in September 1941 from 4-by-4-by-12-inch (10 by 10 by 30 cm) graphite blocks and tinplate iron cans of uranium oxide. The cans were 8-by-8-by-8-inch (20 by 20 by 20 cm) cubes.

The nature and size of the planned Canadian Corps assault necessitated support and resources beyond its normal operational capabilities. Consequently, the British 5th Infantry Division and supplementary artillery, engineer and labour units reinforced the four Canadian divisions already in place. The 24th British Division of I Corps supported the Canadian Corps along its northern flank while the XVII Corps did so to the south. The ad hoc Gruppe Vimy formation, based under I Bavarian Reserve Corps commander General der Infanterie Karl Ritter von Fasbender, was the principal defending formation with three divisions responsible for manning the frontline defences opposite the Canadian Corps. The attack began at 5:30 am on Easter Monday, 9 April 1917. Light field guns laid down a barrage that advanced in predetermined increments, often 91 metres (100 yd) every three minutes, while medium and heavy howitzers established a series of standing barrages against known defensive systems further ahead. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Canadian Divisions quickly captured their first objectives. The 4th Canadian Division encountered a great deal of trouble during its advance and was unable to complete its first objective until some hours later. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Canadian Divisions captured their second objective by approximately 7:30 am. The failure of the 4th Canadian Division to capture the top of the ridge delayed further advances and forced the 3rd Canadian Division to expend resources establishing a defensive line to its north. Reserve units from the 4th Canadian Division renewed the attack on the German positions on the top of the ridge and eventually forced the German troops holding the southwestern portion of Hill 145 to withdraw. On the morning of 10 April, Canadian Corps commander Lieutenant-General Julian Byng moved up three fresh brigades to support the continued advance. The fresh units leapfrogged units already in place and captured the third objective line, including Hill 135 and the town of Th\u00e9lus, by 11:00 am. By 2:00 pm both the 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions reported capturing their final objectives. By this point the \"Pimple\", a heavily defended knoll west of the town of Givenchy-en-Gohelle, was the only German position remaining on Vimy Ridge. On 12 April, the 10th Canadian Brigade attacked and quickly overcame the hastily entrenched German troops, with the support of artillery and the 24th British Division. By nightfall on 12 April, the Canadian Corps was in firm control of the ridge. The Canadian Corps suffered 10,602 casualties: 3,598 killed and 7,004 wounded. The German Sixth Army suffered an unknown number of casualties, and around 4,000 men became prisoners of war. Although the battle is not generally considered Canada's greatest military feat of arms, the image of national unity and achievement imbued the battle with considerable national significance for Canada. According to Pierce, \"the historical reality of the battle has been reworked and reinterpreted in a conscious attempt to give purpose and meaning to an event that came to symbolize Canada's coming of age as a nation.\" The idea that Canada's identity and nationhood were born out of the battle is an opinion that is widely held in military and general histories of Canada. ## History\n\n","h_score":1875931.6812500001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":952246,"revid":1163796766,"description":"Memorial in Pas-de-Calais, in France","categories":["1936 establishments in France","Canada in World War I","Canada\u2013France relations","Canadian military memorials and cemeteries","Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorials","Monuments and memorials in the Pas-de-Calais","National Historic Sites of Canada in France","Sculptures by Walter Seymour Allward","World War I in the Pas-de-Calais","World War I memorials in France"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Vimy Ridge: Canada's Timeless Monument to Sacrifice\n\nThe Canadian National Vimy Memorial in France stands as a powerful tribute to the soldiers who fought in World War I, particularly during the pivotal Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917.

Redshift occurs when light from these distant objects stretches towards the red end of the spectrum due to the Doppler effect, making everything look like it's in a hurry to escape\u2014essentially, the universe's way of saying, \"I'm getting bigger!\" This effect, tied to Einstein's relativity, turns ordinary starlight into a colorful clue about cosmic distances and motions.\n\n**How Do We Detect This Stellar Shift?**  \nAstronomers peer through powerful telescopes, comparing the actual wavelengths of light from stars to their redshifted versions, like decoding a message in a bottle from billions of light-years away. \"Redshift is like the universe whispering its secrets of expansion,\" noted Edwin Hubble, the astronomer who first linked it to the cosmos's growth in the 1920s. By plotting these shifts, scientists map the universe's structure, revealing clusters of galaxies hurtling outward.\n\n**Why Redshift Matters in Our Expanding World**  \nBeyond its role in confirming the Big Bang, redshift helps us ponder dark energy's mysterious push, fueling debates on the universe's ultimate fate. \"It's the key that unlocked the scale of the cosmos,\" observed cosmologist Vera Rubin, highlighting its influence on modern astrophysics. From probing exoplanets to dark matter mysteries, this phenomenon keeps our cosmic curiosity alive.\n\nLooking ahead, as next-generation telescopes delve deeper into the infrared spectrum, redshift promises to illuminate the universe's hidden frontiers, potentially rewriting the story of its beginning and end."}

A liberalizer march took place in Moscow criticizing Communist Party rule, while at a Central Committee meeting, the hardliner Vladimir Brovikov accused Gorbachev of reducing the country to \"anarchy\" and \"ruin\" and of pursuing Western approval at the expense of the Soviet Union and the Marxist\u2013Leninist cause. Gorbachev was aware that the Central Committee could still oust him as general secretary, and so decided to reformulate the role of head of government to a presidency from which he could not be removed. He decided that the presidential election should be held by the Congress of People's Deputies. He chose this over a public vote because he thought the latter would escalate tensions and feared that he might lose it; a spring 1990 poll nevertheless still showed him as the most popular politician in the country.\n\nIn March, the Congress of People's Deputies held the first (and only) Soviet presidential election, in which Gorbachev was the only candidate. He secured 1,329 in favor to 495 against; 313 votes were invalid or absent. He therefore became the first executive President of the Soviet Union. A new 18-member Presidential Council de facto replaced the Politburo. At the same Congress meeting, he presented the idea of repealing Article 6 of the Soviet constitution, which had ratified the Communist Party as the \"ruling party\" of the Soviet Union. The Congress passed the reform, undermining the de jure nature of the one-party state.\n\nIn the 1990 elections for the Russian Supreme Soviet, the Communist Party faced challengers from an alliance of liberalisers known as \"Democratic Russia\"; the latter did particularly well in urban centers. Yeltsin was elected the parliament's chair, something Gorbachev was unhappy about. That year, opinion polls showed Yeltsin overtaking Gorbachev as the most popular politician in the Soviet Union. Gorbachev struggled to understand Yeltsin's growing popularity, commenting: \"he drinks like a fish ... he's inarticulate, he comes up with the devil knows what, he's like a worn-out record\". The Russian Supreme Soviet was now out of Gorbachev's control; in June 1990, it declared that in the Russian Republic, its laws took precedence over those of the Soviet central government. Amid a growth in Russian nationalist sentiment, Gorbachev had reluctantly allowed the formation of a Communist Party of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic as a branch of the larger Soviet Communist Party. Gorbachev attended its first congress in June, but soon found it dominated by hardliners who opposed his reformist stance.\n\n","h_score":2324000.5500000003,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":20979,"revid":1173634535,"description":"Leader of the Soviet Union from 1985 to 1991","categories":["1931 births","2022 deaths","Burials at Novodevichy Cemetery","Candidates in the 1996 Russian presidential election","Candidates of the Politburo of the 25th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union","Club of Rome members","Collars of the Order of the White Lion","Commandeurs of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres","Former Russian Orthodox Christians","Grammy Award winners","Grand Crosses Special Class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany","Heads of state of the Soviet Union","Heads of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union","Honorary Members of the Russian Academy of Arts","Illeists","Members of the Central Committee of the 24th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union","Members of the Central Committee of the 25th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union","Members of the Central Committee of the 26th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union","Members of the Central Committee of the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union","Members of the Central Committee of the 28th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union","Members of the Politburo of the 25th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union","Members of the Politburo of the 26th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union","Members of the Politburo of the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union","Members of the Politburo of the 28th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union","Members of the Secretariat of the 25th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union","Members of the Secretariat of the 26th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union","Members of the Secretariat of the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union","Members of the Secretariat of the 28th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union","Members of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union","Mikhail Gorbachev","Moscow State University alumni","Nobel Peace Prize laureates","People from Stavropol","People of the 1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt","People of the Cold War","People of the Soviet\u2013Afghan War","Recipients of the Order of Honour (Russia)","Recipients of the Order of Lenin","Recipients of the Order of the Red Banner of Labour","Recipients of the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award","Reformers","Russian Nobel laureates","Russian activists against the Russian invasion of Ukraine","Russian anti\u2013nuclear weapons activists","Russian atheists","Russian democracy activists","Russian people of Ukrainian descent","Russian social democrats","Soviet Nobel laureates","Soviet anti\u2013nuclear weapons activists","Soviet democracy activists","Soviet reformers","Time Person of the Year"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"# Mikhail Gorbachev: The Reformer Who Redefined the World\n\nMikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, spearheaded transformative policies that hastened the end of the Cold War and reshaped global politics. His era of openness and restructuring not only dismantled the Iron Curtain but also sparked widespread democratic movements across Eastern Europe.\n\n### Early Life and Rise to Power\nBorn in 1931 in a humble Russian village, Gorbachev rose through the ranks of the Communist Party, becoming General Secretary in 1985 amid a stagnant Soviet economy. His background as a law student and party official fueled his vision for change, contrasting sharply with the rigid leaders before him, as he sought to modernize a faltering superpower.\n\n### Key Reforms and Achievements\nGorbachev introduced perestroika, or economic restructuring, and glasnost, promoting transparency and free speech, which ignited a wave of reforms like nuclear arms reductions with the U.S. These bold moves, as he once said, \"We need perestroika to breathe new life into our society,\" helped ease East-West tensions and earned him the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize. However, his initiatives also unleashed unintended chaos, accelerating the Soviet Union's fragmentation.\n\n### Legacy and Global Influence\nGorbachev's tenure left an indelible mark, symbolizing the triumph of diplomacy over division, though it drew criticism for the hardships that followed the USSR's 1991 dissolution. As former U.S. President Ronald Reagan noted, \"He was a great man, and he changed the world,\" highlighting Gorbachev's role in fostering peace. His efforts paved the way for a more interconnected world, blending idealism with pragmatism.\n\nAs global tensions persist, Gorbachev's emphasis on dialogue offers a blueprint for resolving modern conflicts."}

The \"changes\" involved have been interpreted as the transformations of hexagrams, of their lines, or of the numbers obtained from the divination. Feng Youlan proposed that the word for \"changes\" originally meant \"easy\", as in a form of divination easier than the oracle bones, but there is little evidence for this. There is also an ancient folk etymology that sees the character for \"changes\" as containing the sun and moon, the cycle of the day. Modern Sinologists believe the character to be derived either from an image of the sun emerging from clouds, or from the content of a vessel being changed into another.\n\nThe Zhou yi was traditionally ascribed to the Zhou cultural heroes King Wen of Zhou and the Duke of Zhou, and was also associated with the legendary world ruler Fu Xi. According to the canonical Great Commentary, Fu Xi observed the patterns of the world and created the eight trigrams (\u516b\u5366; b\u0101gu\u00e0), \"in order to become thoroughly conversant with the numinous and bright and to classify the myriad things.\" The Zhou yi itself does not contain this legend and indeed says nothing about its own origins. The Rites of Zhou, however, also claims that the hexagrams of the Zhou yi were derived from an initial set of eight trigrams. During the Han dynasty there were various opinions about the historical relationship between the trigrams and the hexagrams. Eventually, a consensus formed around 2nd-century AD scholar Ma Rong's attribution of the text to the joint work of Fu Xi, King Wen of Zhou, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius, but this traditional attribution is no longer generally accepted.\n\n","h_score":2088910.7375,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":26335002,"revid":1171202468,"description":"Ancient Chinese text used for divination","categories":["1st-millennium BC books","Chinese books of divination","Chinese folk religion","Esoteric schools of thought","I Ching","Philosophy books","Precursors of electronic literature","Synchronicity","Thirteen Classics","Zhou dynasty texts"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Unlocking the Ancient Wisdom of the I Ching\n\nThe I Ching, or Book of Changes, is an ancient Chinese oracle that has guided seekers for millennia with its hexagrams and philosophical insights.

In a 1998 interview, Aronofsky acknowledged several influences for Pi: \"I'm a big fan of Kurosawa and Fellini. In this film in particular I think there's a lot of Roman Polanski influence and Terry Gilliam influence as well as a Japanese director named Shinya Tsukamoto\u2014he directed The Iron Man, Tetsuo.\" The visual style of Pi and Requiem for a Dream features numerous similarities to Tetsuo: The Iron Man. The majority of reviewers characterized Requiem for a Dream in the genre of \"drug movies\", along with films like The Basketball Diaries, Trainspotting, Spun, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. But, Aronofsky placed his movie in a wider context, saying: > Requiem for a Dream is not about heroin or about drugs ... The Harry-Tyrone-Marion story is a very traditional heroin story. But putting it side by side with the Sara story, we suddenly say, 'Oh, my God, what is a drug?' The idea that the same inner monologue goes through a person's head when they're trying to quit drugs, as with cigarettes, as when they're trying to not eat food so they can lose 20 pounds, was really fascinating to me. I thought it was an idea that we hadn't seen on film and I wanted to bring it up on the screen. Dream logic is another leitmotif. With his friend Ari Handel, Aronofsky developed the plot for The Fountain; the director wrote the screenplay. In 1999, Aronofsky thought that The Matrix redefined the science fiction genre in film. He sought to make a science fiction film that explored new territory, as did The Matrix and its predecessors Star Wars and 2001: A Space Odyssey. He wanted to go beyond science fiction films with plots driven by technology and science. In the Toronto International Film Festival interview conducted by James Rocchi, Aronofsky credited the 1957 Charles Mingus song \"The Clown\" as a major influence on The Wrestler. It is an instrumental piece, with a poem read over the music about a clown who accidentally discovers the bloodlust of the crowds and eventually kills himself in performance. Aronofsky called Black Swan a companion piece to The Wrestler, recalling one of his early projects about a love affair between a wrestler and a ballerina. He eventually separated the wrestling and the ballet worlds, considering them as \"too much for one movie\". He compared the two films: \"Wrestling some consider the lowest art\u2014if they would even call it art\u2014and ballet some people consider the highest art. But what was amazing to me was how similar the performers in both of these worlds are. They both make incredible use of their bodies to express themselves.\" About the psychological thriller nature of Black Swan, actress Natalie Portman compared the film's tone to Polanski's 1968 film Rosemary's Baby, while Aronofsky said Polanski's Repulsion (1965) and The Tenant (1976) were \"big influences\" on the final film. Actor Vincent Cassel also compared Black Swan to Polanski's early films, commenting that it was also influenced by Alejandro Jodorowsky's movies and David Cronenberg's early work. Aronofsky has also mentioned that he \"learned a lot\" from Jean-Luc Godard's film Breathless.","h_score":1922988.9625000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":173294,"revid":1173802862,"description":"American filmmaker","categories":["1969 births","20th-century American Jews","20th-century American male writers","20th-century American screenwriters","21st-century American Jews","21st-century American male writers","21st-century American screenwriters","AFI Conservatory alumni","Activists from New York City","American film directors","American film producers","American male screenwriters","American music video directors","American television producers","Camp Rising Sun alumni","Darren Aronofsky","Directors of Golden Lion winners","Edward R.

Her seventh studio album, Ray of Light, (1998) reflected this change in her perception and image. She collaborated with electronica producer William Orbit and wanted to create a sound that could blend dance music with pop and British rock. American music critic Ann Powers explained that what Madonna searched for with Orbit \"was a kind of a lushness that she wanted for this record. Techno and rave were happening in the 90s and had a lot of different forms. There was very experimental, more hard stuff like Aphex Twin. There was party stuff like Fatboy Slim. That's not what Madonna wanted for this. She wanted something more like a singer-songwriter, really. And William Orbit provided her with that.\" The album garnered critical acclaim, with Slant Magazine calling it \"one of the great pop masterpieces of the '90s\" Ray of Light was honored with four Grammy Awards\u2014including Best Pop Album and Best Dance Recording\u2014and was nominated for both Album of the Year and Record of the Year. Rolling Stone listed it among \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". Commercially, the album peaked at number-one in numerous countries and sold more than 16 million copies worldwide. The album's lead single, \"Frozen\", became Madonna's first single to debut at number one in the UK, while in the U.S. it became her sixth number-two single, setting another record for Madonna as the artist with the most number-two hits. The second single, \"Ray of Light\", debuted at number five on the Billboard Hot 100. The 1998 edition of Guinness Book of World Records documented that \"no female artist has sold more records than Madonna around the world\". Madonna founded Ray of Light Foundation which focused on women, education, global development and humanitarian. She recorded the single \"Beautiful Stranger\" for the 1999 film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, which earned her a Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. Madonna starred in the 2000 comedy-drama film The Next Best Thing, directed by John Schlesinger. The film opened at number two on the U.S. box office with \\$5.9 million grossed in its first week, but this quickly diminished. She also contributed two songs to the film's soundtrack\u2014a cover of Don McLean's 1971 song \"American Pie\" and an original song \"Time Stood Still\"\u2014the former became her ninth UK number-one single. Madonna released her eighth studio album, Music, in September 2000. It featured elements from the electronica-inspired Ray of Light era, and like its predecessor, received acclaim from critics.

Her 1983 debut album catapulted her into the spotlight with hits like \"Like a Virgin,\" blending synth-pop with provocative visuals that turned her into an overnight sensation, all while navigating the male-dominated music industry with unyielding grit.\n\n#### Reinvention and the Art of Provocation\nMadonna's genius lies in her constant evolution, from the lace-gloved pop princess of the '80s to the yoga-enthusiast activist of today, always using her platform to challenge norms. \"I'm tough, ambitious, and I know exactly what I want,\" she once declared, as quoted in a 1990 Rolling Stone interview, encapsulating her drive amid scandals like her sex-positive book \"Sex.\" Yet, as music critic Lucy O'Brien noted in her biography, \"She paved the way for every female artist today,\" highlighting Madonna's role in empowering women through bold performances that mixed sacred and profane with dazzling flair.\n\n#### Legacy: A Cultural Earthquake\nBeyond the hits and headlines, Madonna's influence ripples through fashion, feminism, and film, from her role in \"Evita\" to her charity work in Malawi, making her a one-woman revolution. Her tours, like the record-breaking Madame X shows, fuse theater, politics, and spectacle, proving age is just another costume she discards with style.\n\nAs the icon plots her next boundary-blurring venture, perhaps a fusion of AI and autobiography, the global stage braces for yet another seismic shift."}

Referring to a \"feminised history\", he said: \"so many of the writers who write about this are women and so much of their audience is a female audience.\" This prompted the historian Lucy Worsley to describe his comments as misogynistic. More recently, in 2011, he taught five history lessons in Channel 4's Jamie's Dream School, after which he criticised the state education system. > The core of history is narrative and biography. And the way history has been presented in the curriculum for the last 25 years is very different. The importance of knowledge has been downgraded. Instead the argument has been that it's all about skills. Supposedly, what you are trying to do with children is inculcate them with the analytical skills of the historian. Now this seems to me to be the most goddamn awful way to approach any subject, and also the most dangerous, and one, of course, that panders to all sorts of easy assumptions \u2013 \u2018oh we've got the internet, we don't need knowledge anymore because it's so easy to look things up'. Oh no it isn't. In order to think, you actually need the information in your mind. In 1984, Starkey was elected a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and in 1994 a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. He was also made an Honorary Fellow by his Cambridge College, Fitzwilliam College in 2006. From 2007 to 2015 he was Honorary Visiting Professor of History at the University of Kent and subsequently Lecturer at Goldsmiths\u2019 College (2017), Visiting Professor of History of Canterbury Christ Church University (2018\u201320) and Honorary Professor of History at the University of Buckingham (2019\u201320). He has worked as curator on several exhibitions, including an exhibit in 2003 on Elizabeth I, following which he had lunch with her namesake, Elizabeth II. Several years later he told a reporter that the monarch had no interest in her predecessors, other than those who followed her great-grandfather, Edward VII. \"I don't think she's at all comfortable with anybody \u2013 I would hesitate to use the word intellectual \u2013 but it's useful. I think she's got elements a bit like Goebbels in her attitude to culture \u2013 you remember: 'every time I hear the word culture I reach for my revolver.' I think the queen reaches for her mask.\" His remarks were criticised by Penny Junor, a royal biographer, and Robert Lacey, a royal historian.

Visitation to Glacier National Park averaged about 3.5 million visitors in 2019, which surpassed its 2017 peak of 3.31 million. Glacier has had at least 2 million annual visitors consistently since 2012, but has broken annual attendance records from 2014 to 2018.\n\nGlacier National Park finished with a \\$13.803 million budget in 2016, with a planned budget of \\$13.777 million for 2017. In anticipation of the 100th anniversary of the park in 2010, major reconstruction of the Going-to-the-Sun Road was completed. The Federal Highway Administration managed the reconstruction project in cooperation with the National Park Service. Some rehabilitation of major structures such as visitor centers and historic hotels, as well as improvements in wastewater treatment facilities and campgrounds, are expected to be completed by the anniversary date. The National Park Service is engaged in fishery studies for Lake McDonald to assess status and develop protection programs to enhance native fish populations. The restoration of park trails, education and youth programs, park improvements and many community programs have been planned and are ongoing.\n\nThe National Park Service mandate is to \"...  preserve and protect natural and cultural resources\". The Organic Act of August 25, 1916 established the National Park Service as a federal agency. One major section of the Act has often been summarized as the \"Mission\", \"...  to promote and regulate the use of the  ... national parks  ... which purpose is to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wildlife therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\" In keeping with this mandate, hunting is illegal in the park, as are mining, logging, and the removal of natural or cultural resources. Additionally, oil and gas exploration and extraction are not permitted. These restrictions, however, caused a lot of conflict with the adjoining Blackfeet Indian Reservation. When they sold the land to the United States government, it was with the stipulation of being able to maintain their usage rights of the area, many of which (such as hunting) had come into conflict with these regulations.\n\nIn 1974, a wilderness study was submitted to Congress which identified 95% of the area of the park as qualifying for wilderness designation. Unlike a few other parks, Glacier National Park has yet to be protected as wilderness, but National Park Service policy requires that identified areas listed in the report be managed as wilderness until Congress renders a full decision. Ninety-three percent of Glacier National Park is managed as wilderness, even though it has not been officially designated.\n\n","h_score":1990698.0437500002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":226211,"revid":1173840973,"description":"Park in Montana on the Canadian border","categories":["1910 establishments in Montana","Biosphere reserves of the United States","Civilian Conservation Corps in Montana","Geology of Montana","Glacier National Park (U.S.)","Glaciers of North America","History of the Rocky Mountains","Lewis Range","Livingston Range","National parks in Montana","National parks of the Rocky Mountains","Protected areas established in 1910","Protected areas of Flathead County, Montana","Protected areas of Glacier County, Montana","Rocky Mountains","World Heritage Sites in the United States"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's the scoop on Glacier National Park\u2014why's it called that, anyway?  \nA1: Picture a sprawling wilderness in Montana's Rocky Mountains, where ancient glaciers carve dramatic peaks and valleys\u2014it's a 1-million-acre jewel of the U.S. National Park System, established in 1910 to preserve this icy wonderland. These glaciers, though shrinking, give the park its name and a frosty, timeless allure that draws adventurers year-round.\n\nQ2: Where exactly is this glacial paradise hiding out?  \nA2: Tucked into the northwest corner of Montana, near the Canadian border, it's a gateway to the Crown of the Continent ecosystem, spanning rugged terrain that's part of the larger Rocky Mountain range. This spot makes it easily accessible from cities like Kalispell, yet feels like a remote escape into untamed nature.\n\nQ3: How did this park come to be\u2014a quick history lesson with a twist?  \nA3: Born from early 20th-century conservation efforts, it was signed into existence by President Taft in 1910, blending Native American lands with European exploration vibes. Over time, it merged with Canada's Waterton Lakes to form the first International Peace Park, symbolizing cross-border camaraderie amid its jagged, glacier-sculpted landscapes.\n\nQ4: What are the star attractions that make it pop visually?  \nA4: Think glittering lakes like Lake McDonald, mirroring snow-capped peaks, and trails weaving through wildflower meadows and cascading waterfalls. The Going-to-the-Sun Road, a serpentine engineering marvel, offers jaw-dropping vistas that feel like driving through a living postcard of pristine wilderness.\n\nQ5: Who's roaming the park\u2014wildlife with a dramatic flair?  \nA5: Spot grizzly bears lumbering like furry monarchs, elk grazing in alpine meadows, and mountain goats perched precariously on cliffs, all thriving in this biodiversity hotspot.

It's a playground for all levels, blending adrenaline with serene reflection amid the ever-changing weather.\n\nQ7: With climate change in the mix, how are the glaciers faring?  \nA7: Sadly, many of the park's 25 remaining glaciers are melting rapidly due to warming temperatures, potentially vanishing by 2030\u2014a stark reminder of environmental shifts. This crisis underscores the park's role in global conservation efforts, urging visitors to witness and protect these fragile ice giants before they're gone.\n\nQ8: Beyond the ice, what's the park's bigger impact on the world?  \nA8: As a UNESCO World Heritage site, it champions ecosystem preservation, influencing policies on wildlife corridors and climate action across North America. Its unexpected role as a living lab for scientists studying glacial retreat adds depth, turning a simple visit into a profound nudge for planetary stewardship."}

Polish cultural activities in Minsk and Vilnius were less organized. These activities were strictly controlled by the Soviet authorities, which saw to it that these activities portrayed the new Soviet regime in a positive light and vilified the former Polish government. The Soviet propaganda-motivated support for Polish-language cultural activities, however, clashed with the official policy of Russification. The Soviets at first intended to phase out the Polish language and so banned Polish from schools, street signs, and other aspects of life. This policy was, however, reversed at times\u2014first before the elections in October 1939; and later, after the German conquest of France. In November 1940, the Poles of Lw\u00f3w observed the 85th anniversary of Adam Mickiewicz's death. Soon, however, Stalin decided to re-implement the Russification policies. He reversed his decision again, however, when a need arose for Polish-language pro-Soviet propaganda following the German invasion of the Soviet Union; as a result, Stalin permitted the creation of Polish forces in the East and later decided to create a Communist People's Republic of Poland. Many Polish writers collaborated with the Soviets, writing pro-Soviet propaganda. They included Jerzy Borejsza, Tadeusz Boy-\u017bele\u0144ski, Kazimierz Brandys, Janina Broniewska, Jan Brzoza, Teodor Bujnicki, Leon Chwistek, Zuzanna Ginczanka, Halina G\u00f3rska, Mieczys\u0142aw Jastrun, Stefan J\u0119drychowski, Stanis\u0142aw Jerzy Lec, Tadeusz \u0141opalewski, Juliusz Kleiner, Jan Kott, Jalu Kurek, Karol Kuryluk, Leopold Lewin, Anatol Miku\u0142ko, Jerzy Pa\u0144ski, Leon Pasternak, Julian Przybo\u015b, Jerzy Putrament, Jerzy Rawicz, Adolf Rudnicki, W\u0142odzimierz S\u0142obodnik, W\u0142odzimierz Sokorski, El\u017cbieta Szempli\u0144ska, Anatol Stern, Julian Stryjkowski, Lucjan Szenwald, Leopold Tyrmand, Wanda Wasilewska, Stanis\u0142aw Wasilewski, Adam Wa\u017cyk, Aleksander Weintraub and Bruno Winawer. Other Polish writers, however, rejected the Soviet persuasions and instead published underground: Jadwiga Czechowicz\u00f3wna, Jerzy Hordy\u0144ski, Jadwiga Gamska-\u0141empicka, Herminia Naglerowa, Beata Oberty\u0144ska, Ostap Ortwin, Tadeusz Peiper, Teodor Parnicki, Juliusz Petry. Some writers, such as W\u0142adys\u0142aw Broniewski, after collaborating with the Soviets for a few months, joined the anti-Soviet opposition. Similarly, Aleksander Wat, initially sympathetic to communism, was arrested by the Soviet NKVD secret police and exiled to Kazakhstan. ## Underground culture\n\n ### Patrons\n\nPolish culture persisted in underground education, publications, even theater. The Polish Underground State created a Department of Education and Culture (under Stanis\u0142aw Lorentz) which, along with a Department of Labor and Social Welfare (under Jan Stanis\u0142aw Jankowski and, later, Stefan Mateja) and a Department for Elimination of the Effects of War (under Antoni Olszewski and Bronis\u0142aw Domos\u0142awski), became underground patrons of Polish culture. These Departments oversaw efforts to save from looting and destruction works of art in state and private collections (most notably, the giant paintings by Jan Matejko that were concealed throughout the war). They compiled reports on looted and destroyed works and provided artists and scholars with means to continue their work and their publications and to support their families. Thus, they sponsored the underground publication (bibu\u0142a) of works by Winston Churchill and Arkady Fiedler and of 10,000 copies of a Polish primary-school primer and commissioned artists to create resistance artwork (which was then disseminated by Operation N and like activities). Also occasionally sponsored were secret art exhibitions, theater performances and concerts.\n\nOther important patrons of Polish culture included the Roman Catholic Church and Polish aristocrats, who likewise supported artists and safeguarded Polish heritage (notable patrons included Cardinal Adam Stefan Sapieha and a former politician, Janusz Radziwi\u0142\u0142). Some private publishers, including Stefan Kamie\u0144ski, Zbigniew Mitzner and the Ossolineum publishing house, paid writers for books that would be delivered after the war.\n\n","h_score":1874879.9312500001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":10318947,"revid":1168568437,"description":null,"categories":["Cultural history of Poland","Cultural history of World War II","Poland in World War II"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What was Polish culture like before World War II?  \nA1: Before the war, Polish culture was a rich blend of traditions, including literature, music, and folklore, influenced by its history of partitions and independence in 1918. Key elements included works by authors like Henryk Sienkiewicz and a vibrant folk art scene. This cultural heritage played a significant role in national identity.\n\nQ2: How did World War II impact Polish culture overall?  \nA2: The war devastated Polish culture through occupation by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, leading to destruction of landmarks, censorship, and the suppression of Polish language and traditions. Millions of Poles, including intellectuals and artists, were killed or displaced, disrupting cultural continuity. Despite this, underground efforts helped preserve elements of Polish heritage.\n\nQ3: What role did the Polish Underground State play in cultural preservation?  \nA3: The Polish Underground State organized secret cultural activities, such as publishing banned literature and holding clandestine classes, to maintain national spirit. This resistance network ensured that Polish history, language, and education continued despite severe risks. It demonstrated how culture became a tool for defiance and unity.\n\nQ4: How was Polish literature affected during the war?  \nA4: Polish literature went underground, with writers producing works in hiding or through secret presses to evade censorship. Authors like Zofia Na\u0142kowska documented the horrors, while poetry and prose inspired resistance. This period highlighted literature's role in preserving national memory amid oppression.\n\nQ5: What about Polish art and music during World War II?  \nA5: Polish artists and musicians created works in secret, often incorporating themes of resistance and loss, such as in underground theaters and compositions by figures like Witold Lutos\u0142awski. These efforts kept cultural expressions alive, providing morale boosts for the population. Art and music also faced heavy Nazi restrictions, leading to many losses.\n\nQ6: How did the war influence Polish education and traditions?  \nA6: Education was driven underground, with secret universities and schools teaching Polish history and language to counter Germanization efforts. Traditional customs, like holidays and folklore, were suppressed but maintained in private settings. This resilience helped sustain cultural identity for future generations.\n\nQ7: What challenges did Polish Jews face regarding culture during the war?  \nA7: Polish Jewish culture, including Yiddish literature and religious traditions, was targeted for destruction through ghettos and the Holocaust, resulting in the loss of communities and artifacts. Despite this, some Jewish cultural activities persisted in hiding, blending with broader Polish resistance. The tragedy profoundly altered Poland's multicultural fabric.\n\nQ8: How has Polish culture from World War II shaped modern Poland?  \nA8: The wartime experiences influenced modern Polish culture by emphasizing resilience, as seen in memorials, literature, and national holidays. Post-war rebuilding incorporated these themes into education and art, fostering a stronger sense of identity. Today, it serves as a reminder of cultural endurance and informs ongoing discussions about history."}

The alluvial deposits are typically over a thousand feet thick. The interfluves are believed to have been formed during the Late Pleistocene and feature river terraces. These were later identified as old and young floodplains of the Ravi River on the Kamalia and Chenab Plains. The old floodplains consist of Holocene deposits from the Ravi and Chenab rivers.\n\nThe soil consists of young stratified silt loam or very fine sand loam which makes the subsoil weak in structure with common kankers at only five feet. The course of the rivers within Faisalabad are winding and often subject to frequent alternations. In the rainy season, the currents are very strong. This leads to high floods in certain areas which do last for a number of days. The Rakh and Gogera canals have encouraged the water levels in the district however the belt on the Ravi River has remained narrow. The river bed does include the river channels which have shifted the sand bars and low sandy levees leading to river erosion.

Despite facing financial hardships and fading into obscurity, his visionary ideas continue to pulse through modern technology, from electric vehicles to renewable power systems.\n\n#### Early Sparks of Genius\nBorn in 1856 in what is now Croatia, Tesla's life was a whirlwind of innovation, sparked by his fascination with electricity during his youth in Europe. He migrated to the United States in 1884, where his mind conjured vivid images of \"rotating magnetic fields\" that led to over 300 patents, including the AC motor that revolutionized power distribution. This period showcased his playful yet obsessive nature, turning abstract concepts into tangible marvels that lit up cities.\n\n#### Battles of the Currents\nTesla's rivalry with Edison erupted into a high-stakes drama, with AC clashing against direct current (DC) in what became known as the \"War of the Currents.\" As Tesla once said, \"The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine,\" highlighting his unyielding confidence amid betrayals and lost funding. This era of unexpected alliances and courtroom theatrics underscored his isolation, as backers like J.P.

On the site bounded by West 15th and 19th Streets between Surf Avenue and the boardwalk, Bullard wanted to build a \\$55 million amusement park based on the originals. The city agreed, and the project was approved in 1985. Bullard planned to open the park by mid-1986 to coincide with the Statue of Liberty's centennial. However, the project was delayed while the New York City Planning Commission compiled an environmental impact report. By early 1987, the cost of the amusement park nearly doubled, to \\$100 million. Concurrently, in December 1986, the New York State Urban Development Corporation formally proposed a 17,000-seat minor-league baseball stadium north of the boardwalk between West 19th and West 22nd Streets as well as 15,000-seat indoor arena north of the Abe Stark Rink. Negotiations were ongoing with the Mets and Yankees to ensure their support for the minor-league stadium. State senator Thomas Bartosiewicz attempted to block Bullard's plan, as he was part of a foundation that had promised another developer, Sportsplex, the right to build an amateur sports arena on the site. Construction was held up for another four years, and by 1989, Bullard and the city were ready to sign a contract that would allow the developer to construct a 60-ride amusement park on a 25-acre (10 ha) waterfront strip, which would be completed by 2002. Other proposals for the area included a \\$7.9 million restoration of the boardwalk, as well as a new high-school and college sports stadium. Some of Coney Island's iconic rides were designated as official city landmarks during the late 1980s. In 1988, the Cyclone roller coaster was made a New York City designated landmark. This was followed by the Parachute Jump and the Wonder Wheel in 1989. The neighborhood's high crime rate had reversed slightly by the 1990s. However, Coney Island's relative isolation from the rest of New York City, along with its ethnic diversity, deprived the area of significant political power, and to a greater extent money. After Rudy Giuliani took office as New York City mayor in 1994, he negated the Bullard deal by approving the construction of a minor-league baseball stadium on the site allotted for Steeplechase Park. Giuliani had wanted to build Sportsplex in order to improve sports facilities in the area, and to create a professional baseball team in Brooklyn. By the late 1990s, some \\$67 million had been secured for the development of Sportsplex. In 1997, developer Bruce Ratner proposed constructing a \\$100 million entertainment complex between West 9th and West 15th Streets, with a \"virtual-reality amusement park\" as well as a movie theater multiplex. Concurrently, a four-phase, 873-unit housing development in Coney Island was completed in 1996. In 1998, Giuliani canceled Sportsplex and the entertainment complex, and instead unveiled another plan where only the parking lot would be built. The Sports Foundation had prepared another proposal that would allow a scaled-down Sportsplex to be built next to the minor-league baseball stadium. The minor league team was called the Brooklyn Cyclones, though naming rights to the stadium were sold to Keyspan Energy. Bullard, now no longer rebuilding Steeplechase Park, had wanted to restore the Thunderbolt as part of a scaled-down amusement park, but it was demolished instead. In 2000, the city approved the \\$31 million project to construct Keyspan Park using the funds from the canceled Sportsplex, and the minor-league baseball stadium opened the following year. Other major projects at the time included the reconstruction of Coney Island's sewers and the refurbishment of the Stillwell Avenue subway station, the latter of which was completed in 2005.","h_score":2089973.6625000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":151663,"revid":1173043579,"description":"Neighborhood of Brooklyn in New York City","categories":["Amusement parks in New York (state)","Articles containing video clips","Barrier islands of New York (state)","Coney Island","Former islands of New York City","Islands of Brooklyn","Islands of New York City","Neighborhoods in Brooklyn","Populated coastal places in New York (state)","Seaside resorts in New York (state)"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Coney Island?  \nA1: Coney Island is a vibrant seaside neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York, famous for its beaches, amusement parks, and lively entertainment.

The disease is caused by infection with a member of the genus Enterovirus known as poliovirus (PV). This group of RNA viruses colonize the gastrointestinal tract \u2013 specifically the oropharynx and the intestine. Its structure is quite simple, composed of a single (+) sense RNA genome enclosed in a protein shell called a capsid. In addition to protecting the virus' genetic material, the capsid proteins enable poliovirus to infect certain types of cells. Three serotypes of poliovirus have been identified \u2013 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), type 2 (WPV2), and type 3 (WPV3) \u2013 each with a slightly different capsid protein. All three are extremely virulent and produce the same disease symptoms. PV1 is the most commonly encountered form, and the one most closely associated with paralysis. WPV2 was certified as eradicated in 2015 and WPV3 certified as eradicated in 2019.\n\nThe incubation period (from exposure to the first signs and symptoms) ranges from three to six days for nonparalytic polio. If the disease progresses to cause paralysis, this occurs within 7 to 21 days.\n\nIndividuals who are exposed to the virus, either through infection or by immunization via polio vaccine, develop immunity. In immune individuals, IgA antibodies against poliovirus are present in the tonsils and gastrointestinal tract and able to block virus replication; IgG and IgM antibodies against PV can prevent the spread of the virus to motor neurons of the central nervous system. Infection or vaccination with one serotype of poliovirus does not provide immunity against the other serotypes, and full immunity requires exposure to each serotype.\n\nA rare condition with a similar presentation, nonpoliovirus poliomyelitis, may result from infections with enteroviruses other than poliovirus.\n\nThe oral polio vaccine contains weakened viruses that can replicate. On rare occasions, these may be transmitted from the vaccinated person to other people, who may display symptoms of polio. In communities with good vaccine coverage transmission is limited, and the virus dies out. In communities with low vaccine coverage, this weakened virus may continue to circulate. Polio arising from this cause is referred to as circulating vaccine-derived polio (cVDPV) in order to distinguish it from the natural or \"wild\" poliovirus (WPV).\n\n ### Transmission\n\nPoliomyelitis is highly contagious. The disease is transmitted primarily via the fecal\u2013oral route, by ingesting contaminated food or water. It is occasionally transmitted via the oral\u2013oral route. It is seasonal in temperate climates, with peak transmission occurring in summer and autumn. These seasonal differences are far less pronounced in tropical areas. Polio is most infectious between 7 and 10 days before and after the appearance of symptoms, but transmission is possible as long as the virus remains in the saliva or feces. Virus particles can be excreted in the feces for up to six weeks.\n\nFactors that increase the risk of polio infection include pregnancy, the very old and the very young, immune deficiency, and malnutrition. Although the virus can cross the maternal-fetal barrier during pregnancy, the fetus does not appear to be affected by either maternal infection or polio vaccination. Maternal antibodies also cross the placenta, providing passive immunity that protects the infant from polio infection during the first few months of life.\n\n","h_score":2206646.4500000002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":25107,"revid":1171956734,"description":"Infectious disease caused by poliovirus","categories":["Central nervous system disorders","Infectious diseases with eradication efforts","Myelin disorders","Polio","Vaccine-preventable diseases","Wikipedia infectious disease articles ready to translate","Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":300,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Eradicating Polio: A Virus on the Brink of Defeat\n\nPolio, a crippling viral disease that once paralyzed thousands worldwide, has been dramatically curtailed by vaccines since the mid-20th century. Despite this progress, the fight continues in remote areas where vaccination gaps allow the virus to linger, threatening global health security.\n\n**What is Polio?**  \nPolio is a highly infectious virus that spreads through contaminated water and food, primarily affecting young children and leading to symptoms ranging from flu-like illness to irreversible paralysis. First identified in the late 19th century, it thrives in areas with poor sanitation, turning everyday environments into silent battlegrounds for this stealthy invader.\n\n**The Fight Against Polio**  \nGlobal efforts ramped up in the 1950s with the development of the polio vaccine by Jonas Salk, sparking widespread immunization campaigns. \"The conquest of polio is just a matter of continuing to get the vaccine to those who need it,\" said Dr. Jonas Salk, the vaccine's pioneer, emphasizing the power of prevention.\n\n**Challenges and Progress Today**  \nWhile wild poliovirus has been eliminated in most countries, hotspots in places like Pakistan and Afghanistan pose ongoing risks due to conflict and access issues. \"We are closer than ever to ending polio, but complacency could undo decades of hard work,\" warns Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, highlighting the need for vigilance. Advances in surveillance and oral vaccines have reduced cases by over 99% since 1988.\n\nAs global vaccination drives intensify, experts foresee a polio-free world within the next decade, offering hope for future generations."}

At least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart\n2. One unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years\n3. Diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome\n\nFurthermore, epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who had an age-dependent epilepsy syndrome but are now past that age or those who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the last 5 years.\n\nThis 2014 definition of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) is a clarification of the ILAE 2005 conceptual definition, according to which epilepsy is \"a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiologic, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The definition of epilepsy requires the occurrence of at least one epileptic seizure.\"\n\nIt is, therefore, possible to outgrow epilepsy or to undergo treatment that causes epilepsy to be resolved, but with no guarantee that it will not return. In the definition, epilepsy is now called a disease, rather than a disorder. This was a decision of the executive committee of the ILAE, taken because the word \"disorder,\" while perhaps having less stigma than does \"disease,\" also does not express the degree of seriousness that epilepsy deserves.\n\nThe definition is practical in nature and is designed for clinical use. In particular, it aims to clarify when an \"enduring predisposition\" according to the 2005 conceptual definition is present. Researchers, statistically minded epidemiologists, and other specialized groups may choose to use the older definition or a definition of their own devising. The ILAE considers doing so is perfectly allowable, so long as it is clear what definition is being used.\n\nThe ILAE definition for one seizure needs an understanding of projecting an enduring predisposition to the generation of epileptic seizures. WHO for instance chooses to just use the traditional definition of two unprovoked seizures.\n\n ### Classification\n\nIn contrast to the classification of seizures which focuses on what happens during a seizure, the classification of epilepsies focuses on the underlying causes. When a person is admitted to hospital after an epileptic seizure the diagnostic workup results preferably in the seizure itself being classified (e.g. tonic-clonic) and in the underlying disease being identified (e.g. hippocampal sclerosis). The name of the diagnosis finally made depends on the available diagnostic results and the applied definitions and classifications (of seizures and epilepsies) and its respective terminology.\n\nThe International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) provided a classification of the epilepsies and epileptic syndromes in 1989 as follows:\n\n{\\| cellpadding=5 style=\"border:1px solid \\#ccc\"\n\n\\|- bgcolor=\"#fafafa\" \\|\n\n1.

It can affect people of all ages and is one of the most common neurological conditions. Seizures vary in type and severity but are the hallmark of the disorder.\n\nQ2: What causes epilepsy?  \nA2: Epilepsy can be caused by various factors, including genetic influences, brain injuries, infections, or strokes. In some cases, the cause is unknown, referred to as idiopathic epilepsy. Certain conditions like brain tumors or developmental disorders may also contribute.\n\nQ3: What are the common symptoms of epilepsy?  \nA3: The main symptom is seizures, which can manifest as convulsions, staring spells, or temporary confusion. Other symptoms might include auras before a seizure, fatigue afterward, or loss of awareness. Symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure.\n\nQ4: How is epilepsy diagnosed?  \nA4: Diagnosis typically involves a medical history review, neurological exams, and tests like EEG to detect brain activity. Imaging tests such as MRI or CT scans help identify underlying causes. A doctor may also observe seizure patterns over time.\n\nQ5: What treatments are available for epilepsy?  \nA5: Treatment often includes anti-seizure medications to control or reduce seizures. In some cases, surgery, dietary changes, or devices like vagus nerve stimulators are used. The goal is to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.\n\nQ6: Can epilepsy be prevented?  \nA6: While not all cases can be prevented, avoiding head injuries, managing conditions like high blood pressure, and getting vaccinated against infections may reduce risk. Genetic counseling can help for those with a family history. Early treatment of underlying causes is key.\n\nQ7: How does epilepsy affect daily life?  \nA7: Epilepsy can impact daily activities through seizure risks, leading to limitations in driving, swimming, or operating machinery. It may cause emotional challenges like anxiety or stigma, but with management, many people lead independent lives. Support from healthcare providers and family is essential.\n\nQ8: What are common misconceptions about epilepsy?  \nA8: A common misconception is that all seizures involve violent convulsions; many are subtle.

By May 1982, ON TV in southern California had reached its zenith\u2014400,000 subscribers, representing two-thirds of Oak's base of some 600,000 paying customers in its five ON TV markets, not counting Detroit, Cincinnati, or Portland. After the FCC repealed a rule in late 1982 that required television stations offering a subscription service to broadcast at least 20 hours a week of unencrypted programming, KBSC began running ON TV 24 hours a day and displaced its existing Spanish-language daytime programming. However, the STV industry took a national nosedive moving into 1983. A national recession and the increased penetration of multichannel cable television created new and immediate financial headwinds for Oak and ON TV. In March 1984, the company announced that it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and it posted a loss of \\$166.1 million for 1983. One of the company's auditors, Arthur Andersen, qualified its statement, fearing that Oak could not fully realize its \\$134 million investment in subscription television. After having shuttered two ON TV operations in markets with combative station owners and high cable penetration\u2014Dallas\u2013Fort Worth and Phoenix\u2014Oak moved to sell its station in the Miami market in 1984 to John Blair & Co., which planned Spanish-language programming.
