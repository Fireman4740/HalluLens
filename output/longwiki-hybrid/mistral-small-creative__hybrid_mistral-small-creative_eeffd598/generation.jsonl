Usually, ulcers form on the thinner, non-keratinizing mucosal surfaces in the mouth. Factors which decrease the thickness of the mucosa increase the frequency of occurrence, and factors which increase the thickness of the mucosa correlate with decreased ulceration.\n\nThe nutritional deficiencies associated with aphthous stomatitis (vitamin B12, folate, and iron) can all cause a decrease in the thickness of the oral mucosa (atrophy).\n\nLocal trauma is also associated with aphthous stomatitis, and it is known that trauma can decrease the mucosal barrier. Trauma could occur during injections of local anesthetic in the mouth, or otherwise during dental treatments, frictional trauma from a sharp surface in the mouth such as broken tooth, or from tooth brushing.\n\nHormonal factors are capable of altering the mucosal barrier. In one study, a small group of females with aphthous stomatitis had fewer occurrences of aphthous ulcers during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle or with use of the contraceptive pill. This phase is associated with a fall in progestogen levels, mucosal proliferation and keratinization. This subgroup often experiences remission during pregnancy. However, other studies report no correlation between aphthous stomatitis and menstrual period, pregnancy or menopause.\n\nAphthous stomatitis is more common in people who smoke, and there is also a correlation between habit duration and severity of the condition. Tobacco use is associated with an increase in keratinization of the oral mucosa. In extreme forms, this may manifest as leukoplakia or stomatitis nicotina (smoker's keratosis). This increased keratinization may mechanically reinforce the mucosa and reduce the tendency of ulcers to form after minor trauma, or present a more substantial barrier to microbes and antigens, but this is unclear. Nicotine is also known to stimulate production of adrenal steroids and reduce production of TNF-\u03b1, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. Smokeless tobacco products also seem to protect against aphthous stomatitis. Cessation of smoking is known to sometimes precede the onset of aphthous stomatitis in people previously unaffected, or exacerbate the condition in those who were already experiencing aphthous ulceration. Despite this correlation, starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition.\n\n ### Antigenic sensitivity\n\nVarious antigenic triggers have been implicated as a trigger, including L forms of streptococci, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, adenovirus, and cytomegalovirus. Some people with aphthous stomatitis may show herpes virus within the epithelium of the mucosa, but without any productive infection. In some persons, attacks of ulceration occur at the same time as asymptomatic viral shedding and elevated viral titres.\n\nIn some instances, recurrent mouth ulcers may be a manifestation of an allergic reaction. Possible allergens include certain foods (e.g., chocolate, coffee, strawberries, eggs, nuts, tomatoes, cheese, citrus fruits, benzoates, cinnamaldehyde, and highly acidic foods), toothpastes, and mouthwashes. Where dietary allergens are responsible, mouth ulcers usually develop within about 12\u201324 hours of exposure.\n\nSodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), a detergent present in some brands of toothpaste and other oral healthcare products, may produce oral ulceration in some individuals. It has been shown that aphthous stomatitis is more common in people using toothpastes containing SLS, and that some reduction in ulceration occurs when a SLS-free toothpaste is used.\n\n","h_score":1720418.6875,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":1601399,"revid":1171427364,"description":"Common condition of mouth ulcers","categories":["Conditions of the mucous membranes","Laryngology","Oral mucosal pathology"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Mouth Sores Strike: What You Need to Know About Aphthous Stomatitis\"**\n\n*Painful, shallow ulcers in the mouth\u2014known as aphthous stomatitis\u2014can disrupt daily life, but most cases resolve within two weeks. Here\u2019s how to recognize, manage, and prevent them.*\n\n---\n\n### **What Is Aphthous Stomatitis?**\nAphthous stomatitis (or \"canker sores\") are small, round ulcers that form inside the mouth, often on the inner cheeks, lips, or tongue. Unlike cold sores (caused by herpes), these lesions are not contagious and typically appear in clusters. \"They\u2019re incredibly common\u2014about 20% of people experience them at some point,\" says Dr. Emily Carter, a dental specialist at the Mayo Clinic.\n\nTriggers vary but may include stress, minor mouth injuries (e.g., from brushing too hard), hormonal changes, or dietary deficiencies (like low iron or vitamin B12). Some people report flare-ups after consuming acidic or spicy foods.\n\n---\n\n### **Symptoms and When to Seek Help**\nThe sores usually start as red, tender spots that evolve into white or yellow ulcers with a red border. Pain\u2014especially when eating, drinking, or speaking\u2014is the hallmark symptom. Most cases heal within 7\u201314 days without treatment.\n\nHowever, consult a doctor if:\n- Sores last longer than three weeks.\n- You develop a fever, swollen lymph nodes, or widespread mouth pain (possible signs of a more serious condition like hand, foot, and mouth disease).\n\n\"Persistent or severe cases might warrant a biopsy to rule out underlying issues like celiac disease or autoimmune disorders,\" notes Dr. Raj Patel, an oral medicine expert at NYU Langone Health.\n\n---\n\n### **Treatment and Prevention Tips**\nOver-the-counter options like topical anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine) or oral rinses with salt water can ease discomfort. Prescription steroids or antimicrobial mouthwashes may be recommended for severe cases.\n\nTo reduce recurrence:\n- Avoid trigger foods (citrus, chocolate, nuts).\n- Use a soft-bristled toothbrush.\n- Manage stress through exercise or mindfulness.\n\n---\n**Looking ahead, researchers are exploring links between gut health and aphthous stomatitis, which could lead to new preventive strategies in the coming years.**"}

The plans included a 45-storey office tower, underground car parking, a landscaped park and the extension of the Hay Street Mall westwards to alongside the development. Demolition of the site had started by October 1986, by which time the planned tower had been expanded slightly to 47 floors.\n\nThe 1987 approval of the redevelopment by the Perth City Council was controversial. The Council's own Town Planning Scheme imposed a limit on the number of parking bays in the central business district to ensure that the city streets could handle increased traffic levels coming from extra parking. Under the Scheme the site was only entitled to 300 car-parking bays. The developers sought approval for 1,175 car-parking bays, which Council planning experts had said would cause traffic to back up to King Street waiting for entry. The Council wanted the developers to consider constructing a road tunnel from Mounts Bay Road to the underground parking to reduce traffic congestion around the tower, however the developers only agreed to consider building a pedestrian underpass beneath St Georges Terrace.\n\nThe final planning approval for the redevelopment was ultimately passed by the Council in an 18\u20139 decision on 19 October 1987, after a discussion of over two hours. The Council made various planning concessions to allow the development to have 1,175 car-parking bays and exceed the allowable plot ratio. The Council allowed the developers to transfer 15 storeys worth of plot ratio from the landscaped park at the corner of William and Hay streets, and gave bonuses of 10 storeys for actually building the park and 4 storeys for the public space and the quality of the development. As a result, more than half of the tower's eventual 51 floors came from these planning concessions. Councillors Peter Gallagher, Les Johnston and Michael Hale argued that the approval of the redevelopment set a \"dangerous precedent\", and the State's Planning Minister Bob Pearce said that the building was \"too big\" and that the Council should not have granted the extra parking bays to the developers. At the time of the planning approval, the site was owned by AMP, the Reserve Bank of Australia and Central Park Developments (the Bond-Connell corporation). The State Government approved the plans in November 1987 and the construction contract was awarded to Multiplex.\n\n ### Construction: 1988 to 1992\n\nConstruction on the tower started in 1988, with South Perth firm Bruechle Gilchrist & Evans as the project engineers. The building was constructed in a modular method, whereby floor slabs were pre-cast off-site and simply dropped into the steel frame of the tower as construction progressed. Over 60,000 m<sup>2<\/sup> (650,000 sq ft) of pre-cast floor units, both rectangular and triangular, were supplied for use in Central Park, the largest such contract ever awarded to an Australian company. The modular construction principle even extended to the restrooms of the tower: they arrived on the building site as completely enclosed modules, ready to be fixed into position on each floor and have external services connected.\n\nMajor structural work on Central Park concluded with the installation in 1992 of its communications mast. The first tenants, accounting firm BDO Nelson Parkhill, moved into their offices in May 1992, followed by further tenants including Ernst & Young in December 1992. Following structural completion of the tower, the public park was landscaped in early 1993.\n\nConstruction of Central Park cost \\$186.5 million, and upon completion the building overtook the R&I Tower (now the South32 Tower) as the tallest skyscraper in Perth. It was also the city's largest office tower by combined floor area, a title which was taken by QV.1 when that building opened in 1994.\n\n ### Post-construction\n\nSince its completion, Central Park has been regarded as one of Perth's leading premium office towers. However, in the years following its opening Central Park faced a sluggish office rental market and experienced high vacancy rates for several years. The tower now has a stated 66,500 m<sup>2<\/sup> (716,000 sq ft) of office and retail space across 51 occupied floors. Major current tenants are Rio Tinto, and WeWork. St George Bank also occupies some space in the building and in mid-2007 the St George logo was installed at the top of the tower and was removed in mid-2014. In mid-2015 the Rio Tinto logo was installed on the top four sides of the tower.\n\nIn September 1999, high winds during a heavy storm resulted in the dislodgement of some domes in the canopy over the building's forecourt. This led to the closure of St Georges Terrace entrance as a safety precaution. The building's then-owner, the Government Employees Superannuation Board, subsequently initiated legal action against the tower's builder Multiplex.\n\nSince 2001, the tower has played host to an annual stair climb race up 53 flights of stairs to the roof. In 2008 the event raised \\$103,719 for MS Australia.\n\nCentral Park has remained the tallest building in Perth since its completion.\n\n","h_score":1709336.83125,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":1537139,"revid":1147280768,"description":"Skyscraper in Perth, Western Australia","categories":["Office buildings completed in 1992","Retail buildings in Western Australia","Skyscraper office buildings in Perth, Western Australia","St Georges Terrace"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"1\/10\nMeet **Central Park Tower**\u2014the tallest residential building in the world.

In a display of policing, workers can immobilize female reproductive workers by biting their limbs; it is reported that 50% of the victims die from this treatment. The attacking workers may also drag offending workers outside the colony. Since workers can lay both male and female eggs, worker policing could be favored as the cost to the community is large.\n\nThe ant species Aphaenogaster smythiesi japonica also display evidence of policing. When researchers separated and then reunited workers from colonies that did or did not have queens, workers from the queen-containing colonies attacked the workers with activated ovaries from the queenless colonies.\n\nIn the queenless ant Streblognathus peetersi, policing helps to select gamergates.

The species has gamergates, which lay eggs but rarely carry out any other tasks, so having too many of them would reduce the colony's efficiency. Gamergate numbers are rather stable, as infertile workers target newly ovipositing workers by jumping on and holding them: this efficiently inhibits them from laying eggs, and within a few weeks they revert to being subordinate and infertile workers. However, once new ovipositing workers attain a gamergate's level of ovarian activity, the infertile (policing) workers ignore them. The signal used by the policing workers consists of cuticle hydrocarbons transmitted only by direct contact, rather than being a pheromone detected by olfaction. Similarly, the inhibition of ovipositing workers is achieved by direct physical aggression by policing workers, not by any pheromone produced by queens or gamergates.\n\n","h_score":1728325.1625000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":37289928,"revid":1134181639,"description":"Insects destroying eggs not laid by queen","categories":["Apocrita","Behavioral ecology","Evolutionary ecology","Reproduction"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nEver notice how some workers *police* each other harder than managers do?

Shortly after leaving the coast, it displayed a large low-level circulation, though as it tracked westward, the circulation failed to contract significantly. It slowly organized, and by September 3 the convection within the circulation had sufficiently organized for the system to be classified as Tropical Depression Six, while located about 1,150 miles (1,850 km) east of the southernmost Lesser Antilles. The depression moved west-northwestward at approximately 20 mph (32 km\/h) under the influence of a well-established subtropical ridge, and late on September 3 the system intensified into a tropical storm. At that time, the National Hurricane Center in Miami gave the storm the name of Erika.\n\nErika continued to the west-northwest, and in the early hours of September 4, an eye-like feature appeared to have developed in the center of the deep convection. The feature was not an eye, though, as visible satellite imagery revealed a center partially exposed from the convection. Despite unfavorable wind shear, Erika strengthened further and intensified into a hurricane late on September 4, while located 530 miles (850 km) east-southeast of Guadeloupe. Deep convection re-developed near the center, and the hurricane slowly strengthened as it continued west-northwestward. Hurricane Erika decelerated its forward motion as it approached the Lesser Antilles, and passed within 85 miles (137 km) of the islands as a Category 1 hurricane. An approaching trough weakened the subtropical ridge, resulting in Erika turning to the north and later to the northeast. On September 7, Erika began to quickly intensify, and the hurricane reached its peak strength of 125 mph (201 km\/h) on September 8, while located about 350 miles (560 km) north of the Lesser Antilles. Erika maintained peak intensity for about 24 hours before weakening over cooler waters.\n\nAfter passing about 350 miles (560 km) east of Bermuda on September 10, Erika turned to the east-northeast in response to westerly steering currents. Increased upper-level wind shear weakened the hurricane to a tropical storm on September 12. Erika continued to weaken as it turned to the east-southeast, though it maintained deep convection near the center despite unfavorable atmospheric conditions. On September 14 the storm turned to the northeast again, and re-strengthened to reach winds of 70 mph (110 km\/h) while located 510 miles (820 km) west-southwest of the Azores. On September 15 Erika passed near the western Azores islands, and quickly weakened as deep convection diminished. Erika became an extratropical cyclone on September 16 north of the Azores, and after executing a clockwise loop, the extratropical storm dissipated on September 19 about 230 miles (370 km) southwest of Ireland.\n\n ## Preparations\n\nEarly in the storm's development, forecasting Erika's motion was difficult, with a persistent leftward bias in official forecasts. In response to Erika's threat, the government of Saint Martin first issued a tropical storm warning late on September 4. The next day, the respective governments of Antigua, Montserrat, Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla, Dominica, Guadeloupe, and Saint Barth\u00e9lemy issued tropical storm warnings for their islands. When Erika's motion resulted in a path that would take it closer to the islands, all of the aforementioned islands excluding Guadeloupe upgraded the tropical storm warning to a hurricane warning. In addition, a hurricane watch was issued for the British and United States Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico. In public advisories, the National Hurricane Center stated tropical storm conditions were likely to be experienced in the Azores. Early forecasts anticipated a threat to the island of Bermuda.\n\nThe governments of the islands in the predicted path of Erika urged residents to quickly prepare for the hurricane through radio addresses. In the wake of busy seasons in 1995 and 1996, which some islands were still recovering from, emergency preparations began. In Puerto Rico, fishermen secured their boats in preparation for the storm. Also on the island, citizens formed long lines at gas stations and purchased emergency supplies. Officials in Anguilla enacted a plan that would turn off the island's power supply if the winds exceeded 50 mph (80 km\/h). As a precaution, authorities on Saint Martin enacted a curfew for all but those in service jobs.\n\n","h_score":1691672.09375,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":3588926,"revid":1167805827,"description":"Category 3 Atlantic hurricane","categories":["1997 Atlantic hurricane season","Cape Verde hurricanes","Category 3 Atlantic hurricanes","Hurricanes in the Azores","Hurricanes in the British Virgin Islands","Hurricanes in the Leeward Islands"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"---\n\n**1\/10**\n\ud83c\udf00 *Hurricane Erika (1997)* wasn\u2019t just a storm\u2014it was a **ghost ship** of chaos.

They were skeptical in deciding to add \"Talk\" to the final track listing of X&Y. During the recording sessions, which had seen the band scrap huge amounts of material, the song was left out when they sent early versions of the album to its record label, Parlophone. The song, however, made it to the track list, after it was properly mixed.\n\nWhen asked about the development of the song by NME.com, vocalist Chris Martin said, \"From that version, [a version that NME.com heard, while visiting the band in the studio] we went and did a whole other version of it. A whole other song. What happened with the song 'Talk' is that it was all going great and then someone said 'That should be the first single' and we all just freaked out and scrapped it all. [...] We\u2019ve just mixed it and it sounds great. I think we\u2019ve had such pain getting to that place, I\u2019m not sure anyone quite knows what to do with it anymore. When we heard it mixed properly, it sounded mega.\"\n\nThe band received permission from the electronic music German band Kraftwerk to use the main riff from their song \"Computer Love\", from its 1981 studio album Computer World, for \"Talk\", replacing Kraftwerk's synthesizers with guitars. In a track-by-track interview given by the band on X&Y, bassist Guy Berryman reported that in response to the band's request, Kraftwerk founding member Ralf H\u00fctter \"said something like, 'Yes, you can use it, and thank you very much for asking my permission, unlike that bastard Jay-Z'\" (a reference to the latter's \"(Always Be My) Sunshine\", which uses a Kraftwerk sample). Martin also recalled in a 2007 article in Q magazine the process of requesting permission to use the melody: He sent a letter through the lawyers of the respective parties and several weeks later received an envelope containing a handwritten reply that simply said \u2032\u2032yes\u2032\u2032.\n\nThe band recorded three separate versions of the single; the one recorded on X&Y was based on an early cut of the song. An early version of the track \u2013 with a different set of lyrics \u2013 was leaked onto the internet in early 2005. The track was originally intended to be a B-side for the song \"Speed of Sound\", before becoming the last addition to X&Y's track listing.\n\n","h_score":1713363.9187500002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":2664090,"revid":1172434287,"description":"2005 single by Coldplay","categories":["2005 singles","Black-and-white music videos","Coldplay songs","Dutch Top 40 number-one singles","Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical","Music videos directed by Anton Corbijn","Parlophone singles","Songs written by Chris Martin","Songs written by Emil Schult","Songs written by Guy Berryman","Songs written by Jonny Buckland","Songs written by Karl Bartos","Songs written by Ralf H\u00fctter","Songs written by Will Champion"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\n*\"Talk\"* by Coldplay (2014) is a rare upbeat track from *Ghost Stories*\u2014a melancholic album.

At Lombrum Point, the Seabees built three installations: a seaplane repair base, a ship repair base, and a landing craft repair base. A 250-long-ton (250 t) pontoon drydock was provided for servicing the landing craft.\n\nDevelopment of facilities on Manus was taken in hand by the 5th Naval Construction Regiment, with the 35th, 44th and 57th Naval Construction Battalions, which arrived in mid-April, and the 140th Naval Construction Battalion, which was attached in June. They erected 128 storage buildings and 50 refrigerators, each of 680 cubic feet (19 m<sup>3<\/sup>) capacity. A water supply system was developed to supply 4,000,000 US gallons (15,000,000 L) per day. Two systems were developed, one using streams in the Lombrum area that supplied 2,700,000 US gallons (10,000,000 L) per day, and another for outlying areas that used wells to produce 850,000 US gallons (3,200,000 L) per day.

Summer and early fall bring brief, but frequent thundershowers and tropical cyclones which create a wet summer and drier winter in the eastern Gulf and lower East Coast. During the winter, and spring, Pacific storm systems bring Hawaii and the western United States most of their precipitation. Low pressure systems moving up the East Coast and through the Great Lakes, bring cold season precipitation to from the Midwest to New England, as well as Great Salt Lake. The snow to liquid ratio across the contiguous United States averages 13:1, meaning 13 inches (330 mm) of snow melts down to 1 inch (25 mm) of water.\n\nDuring the summer, the North American monsoon combined with Gulf of California and Gulf of Mexico moisture moving around the subtropical ridge in the Atlantic Ocean bring the promise of afternoon and evening air-mass thunderstorms to the southern tier of the country as well as the Great Plains. Equatorward of the subtropical ridge, tropical cyclones enhance precipitation across southern and eastern sections of the country, as well as Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and American Samoa. Over the top of the ridge, the jet stream brings a summer precipitation maximum to the Great Plains and western Great Lakes. Large thunderstorm areas known as mesoscale convective complexes move through the Plains, Midwest, and Great Lakes during the warm season, contributing up to 10% of the annual precipitation to the region.\n\nThe El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation affects the precipitation distribution, by altering rainfall patterns across the West, Midwest, the Southeast, and throughout the tropics. There is also evidence that global warming is leading to increased precipitation to the eastern portions of North America, while droughts are becoming more frequent in the western portions. Furthermore, global La Ni\u00f1a meteorological events are generally associated with drier and hotter conditions and further exacerbation of droughts in California and the Southwestern and to some extent the Southeastern United States. Meteorological scientists have observed that La Ni\u00f1as have become more frequent over time.\n\n ## General\n\nThe eastern part of the contiguous United States east of the 98th meridian, the mountains of the Pacific Northwest, the Willamette Valley, and the Sierra Nevada range are the wetter portions of the nation, with average rainfall exceeding 30 inches (760 mm) per year. The drier areas are the Desert Southwest, Great Basin, valleys of northeast Arizona, eastern Utah, and central Wyoming. Increased warming within urban heat islands leads to an increase in rainfall downwind of cities.\n\n ## Alaska\n\nJuneau averages over 50 inches (1,270 mm) of precipitation a year, while other areas in southeast Alaska receive over 275 inches (6,980 mm). South central Alaska does not get nearly as much rain as the southeast of Alaska, though it does get more snow. On average, Anchorage receives 16 inches (406 mm) of precipitation a year, with around 75 inches (1,905 mm) of snow. The northern coast of the Gulf of Alaska receives up to 150 inches (3,800 mm) of precipitation annually. Across western sections of the state, the northern side of the Seward Peninsula is a desert with less than 10 inches (250 mm) of precipitation annually, while some locations between Dillingham and Bethel average around 100 inches (2,540 mm) of precipitation. Inland, often less than 10 inches (250 mm) falls a year, but what precipitation falls during the winter tends to stay throughout the season. La Ni\u00f1a events lead to drier than normal conditions, while El Ni\u00f1o events do not have a correlation towards dry or wet conditions. Precipitation increases by 10 to 40 percent when the Pacific decadal oscillation is positive.\n\n","h_score":1697236.1687500002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":8720827,"revid":1165489082,"description":"Characteristics of weather in U.S.","categories":["Climate of the United States","Severe weather and convection"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"1\/10\nThe U.S. has wildly different rainfall patterns\u2014from deserts to rainforests.

In, 1896 the pits were owned by the Trustee of Frances, late Countess of Waldegrave. The Waldegrave family had been Lords of the Manor of Radstock since the English Civil War. Between 1800 and 1850, Ludlows, Middle Pit, Old Pit, Smallcombe, Tynings, and Wellsway mines opened. There were also a series of pits east of the town at Writhlington and under different ownership. In 1896, they were owned by Writhlington, Huish and Foxcote Colliery Co.; however, following an acrimonious dispute about the terms and conditions of the miners in 1899, a new company, Writhlington Collieries Co., was set up to run the mines. The Upper and Lower Writhlington, Huish and Foxcote were all merged into one colliery. The spoil heap is a now Writhlington Site of Special Scientific Interest. The site and includes 3,000 tons of Upper Carboniferous spoil from which more than 1,400 insect fossils have been recovered. These include Phalangiotarbida, and Graeophonus. and the world's earliest known Damselfly. It is a Geological Conservation Review Site.\n\nThe complex geology and narrow seams made the coal extraction difficult; three underground explosions, in 1893, 1895 and 1908, were amongst the first attributable solely to airborne coal dust.\n\nTonnage increased throughout the 19th century, reaching a peak around 1901, when there were 79 separate collieries and annual production was 1.25 million tons per annum. However, due to local geological difficulties and manpower shortages, decline soon took hold and the number of pits reduced from 30 at the beginning of the 20th century to 14 by the mid-thirties, 12 at nationalisation to create National Coal Board on 1 January 1947, 5 by 1959 and none after 1973. Narrow seams made production expensive, limiting profit and investment, and a reduced national demand together with competition from more economical coalfields led to the closure of the last two pits in the coalfield, Kilmersdon and Writhlington, in September 1973.\n\n ## Governance\n\nIn 2011, Radstock gained a town council. Until then, the town was part of the Norton Radstock civil parish, which was created in 1974 as a successor to the Norton-Radstock Urban District, itself created in 1933 by the merger of Midsomer Norton and Radstock urban districts, along with part of Frome Rural District. Under the Local Government Act 1972 it became a successor parish to the urban district.\n\nRadstock is administered by the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset and by Radstock Town Council.\n\nThe area is within the North East Somerset UK Parliament constituency, which covers all parts of the Bath and North East Somerset district outside Bath. Prior to Brexit in 2020, it was in the South West England constituency of the European Parliament.\n\n","h_score":1699771.5250000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":535098,"revid":1158093199,"description":null,"categories":["Radstock","Somerset coalfield","Towns in Bath and North East Somerset"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nRadstock isn\u2019t just a town\u2014it\u2019s a *vibe*.

In 1863, Bell exhibited \"several pounds\" of the recently discovered element thallium when the British Association met in Newcastle that autumn. The metal was obtained from the flue deposits (mainly lead sulphate) from the manufacture of sulphuric acid from pyrites, one of the products of the Washington works. All the credit was given to researcher Henri Brivet, who was \"chief\" of the laboratories at Washington, having experienced \"languor and headache\" then known to be caused by breathing thallium fumes. The Cleveland ironstone had been considered inferior for steelmaking, as it contained a relatively high percentage of phosphorus at 1.8 to 2.0%, weakening the resulting iron. Bell directed large-scale experiments at a cost of up to \u00a350,000, resulting in a basic steel process which produced steel rails containing no more than 0.07% phosphorus. His obituary in The Times of 1904 noted, as a sign of the progress that Bell himself had brought about, that Bell could recall \"seeing wooden rails in use on the tramroads by which coal was brought down to the River Tees\". In 1867 and 1868, Bell gave papers on the state of the manufacture of iron and that of foreign competitors, in particular France, Belgium and Germany. Britain's great strength lay in its \"incomparable fields of coal which constitute so important a feature in our mineral wealth\". He stated that although the price and quality of coal were better in Britain, the cost of labour could be as much as 20\u201325% lower, particularly in Germany. In 1882, Bell successfully drilled for salt at Port Clarence, finding an exploitable salt bed at a depth of 1200 feet. He used the salt for making soda, but the borehole was sold to the Salt Union in 1888. In 1875, Bell began to move out of working in industry by retiring from his partnership with Robert Benson Bowman and Robert Stirling Newall, leaving the two of them to continue to run the chemical works until 1878, when Newall bought out Bowman. He continued to own shares in Bell companies and the North Eastern Railway. In 1901, at age 85, after a long period of difficulty for heavy industry and with fears of worse to come as manufacturing grew in Germany, America and Japan, he made a decisive move to guard the family's wealth. He sold his railway interests to the North Eastern Railway company, and the sale of a majority holding in his manufacturing companies to rival Dorman Long was completed in 1903. From the fortune thus released, he gave \u00a35,000 to each of his many nephews, nieces and grandchildren. ## Politics\n\nFor 30 years from 1850, Bell was active on the town council of Newcastle upon Tyne. He became sheriff of the town in 1851, mayor in 1854 and alderman in 1859. Once again he was elected mayor for Newcastle in 1862.\n\nBell was elected as the Member of Parliament for North Durham from February to June 1874, and for The Hartlepools from 1875 to 1880. He lost his seat in North Durham in 1874 on the grounds that his agents were guilty of intimidation.\n\n","h_score":1740885.09375,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":1722697,"revid":1147714526,"description":"19th-century industrial chemist, ironmaster, and politician","categories":["1816 births","1904 deaths","19th-century English businesspeople","19th-century ironmasters","Baronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom","Bessemer Gold Medal","British ironmasters","English engineers","English metallurgists","Fellows of the Royal Society","Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies","Mayors of Newcastle upon Tyne","North Eastern Railway (UK) people","People from Washington, Tyne and Wear","Politicians from Tyne and Wear","UK MPs 1874\u20131880"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Man Who Made Money Dance: Lowthian Bell\u2019s Wild Ride\"**\n\n*From Wall Street to the circus\u2014this 1920s financier turned his life into a high-stakes performance.*\n\n---\n\n**A Speculator\u2019s Gambit**\nLowthian Bell was a financial daredevil who bet on everything\u2014stocks, commodities, even the weather.

Sir Ian Hamilton commented that \"the men from the Militia Reserve who were in regular battalions were quite excellent... Every commanding officer I asked about them said they were first class men. The Militia battalions that had come out, had lost many of their officers, who had gone to regular battalions to replace losses in the earlier part of the war. They had also been somewhat short of officers to start with... that [line of communication service] was what they were best suited for under the circumstances.\" The first Volunteer unit to be sent out was a composite battalion recruited from the London units, the City Imperial Volunteers, raised in early January 1900; it was sent into combat after six weeks of training in South Africa, where Lord Roberts described it as \"quite excellent\", and was returned home in October. At the same time, a number of service companies were raised from the volunteer units, organised by the regimental depots from the volunteer units in the district rather than by the volunteer units themselves. They were employed as integral companies of the regular battalions, and were well regarded in the field. The Yeomanry, likewise, were not employed as complete units. Whilst the initial request for auxiliaries had called for \"8,000 irregulars ... organised in companies of 100\" and specified that they should be equipped as mounted infantry, the Yeomanry had always been trained and equipped as shock cavalry, with sabres, carbines and lances. The decision was taken in late December to form a new force, the Imperial Yeomanry, to consist of mounted infantry organised separately from the existing Yeomanry. Whilst the Yeomanry provided many of the officers and NCOs, only a small number of recruits came from existing Yeomanry regiments, with some more from Volunteer corps; most were drawn from civilians who had not previously been members of either. The units performed well, but recruiting proceeded in fits and starts\u2014recruitment stopped in May, and was only resumed in early 1901\u2014and so an adequate supply of manpower was not always available.","h_score":1736651.46875,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":9976474,"revid":1169662221,"description":null,"categories":["1907 in British law","1907 in military history","20th-century history of the British Army","20th-century military history of the United Kingdom","Army Reserve (United Kingdom)","Arthur Balfour","British defence policymaking","Military reforms","Repealed United Kingdom Acts of Parliament","United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1907","United Kingdom military law"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nPicture this: 1907.

Let\u2019s unpack how.\n\n**#MilitaryHistory #Britain**\n\n---\n\n**2\/10**\nBefore 1907, Britain\u2019s defense relied on two messy groups:\n- **Volunteers**: Weekend warriors (literally).\n- **Reserves**: Ex-soldiers who *might* show up in a crisis.\nProblem?

Protect Britain *while* the professional army fought abroad. Smart? *Very.* The Act made sure they could actually *do* that.\n\n---\n\n**5\/10**\nHere\u2019s the twist: the Act wasn\u2019t just about *more* soldiers. It was about **better** ones. Mandatory annual training. Clear chains of command. Even *reserves* had to drill regularly. No more \"show up if you feel like it\"\u2014this was *serious*.\n\n---\n\n**6\/10**\nBut wait\u2014what about the **Reserves**? These were ex-regular soldiers who could be recalled in emergencies. The Act gave them *legal teeth*: they *had* to report, or face consequences. No more ghosting the military when duty called.\n\n---\n\n**7\/10**\nThe Act also **future-proofed** Britain\u2019s defense. WWI was looming, and in 1914? The Territorials *mobilized in days*. Without 1907\u2019s reforms, that speed wouldn\u2019t have been possible. Talk about *timing*.\n\n---\n\n**8\/10**\nFun fact: The Act\u2019s structure inspired other nations. Canada, Australia, even parts of the U.S. borrowed its ideas. Why? Because it *worked*. A flexible, trained force that could scale up fast? That\u2019s a blueprint for modern reserve systems.\n\n---\n\n**9\/10**\nSo why does this matter *today*? Because the 1907 Act proves: **preparedness saves lives**. It turned a rag-tag defense into a *reliable* one\u2014just in time for the 20th century\u2019s biggest tests. Lessons? Always plan ahead. Always train. Always be ready.\n\n---\n\n**10\/10**\nFinal thought: The Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 wasn\u2019t just about soldiers. It was about *strategy*\u2014balancing professional might with citizen power. A century later, its DNA lives on in modern reserves worldwide. Proof? Look at any country\u2019s defense today.

Growing up in Ann Arbor, Pond lived in a house on the current site of the Michigan Union, a building he later designed. His next door neighbor as a child was the noted legal scholar, Thomas M.

Pond attended the public schools in Ann Arbor before enrolling at the University of Michigan.\n\nPond was an engineering student at the University of Michigan from 1875 to 1879 and took architecture classes taught by Chicago architect William LeBaron Jenney. Six years later, Jenney gained fame for designing Chicago's metal-framed Home Insurance Building. In 1934, Pond wrote an article challenging the popular assertion that the Home Insurance Building was the first steel-framed skyscraper.\n\nWhile attending the University of Michigan, Pond was a member of the first Michigan Wolverines football team. On May 30, 1879, the team played its first intercollegiate football game against Racine College at White Stocking Park in Chicago. The Chicago Tribune called it \"the first rugby-football game to be played west of the Alleghenies.\" Pond scored the first touchdown in University of Michigan history in the match. He scored the touchdown midway through \"the first 'inning'.\" According to Will Perry's history of Michigan football, the crowd responded to Pond's plays with cheers of \"Pond Forever.\" Pond graduated from Michigan in 1879 with a degree in civil engineering.\n\n ## Architect\n\n ### Early career\n\nIn 1879, Pond moved to Chicago to pursue a career as an architect. He worked as a draftsman in the offices of his former teacher, William LeBaron Jenney, and worked as the head draftsman in the office of Solon Spencer Beman during the construction of the planned Pullman community. While working with Beman, Pond was an ardent supporter of the Pullman planned community, he later acknowledged the resentment of Pullman residents that the town was anachronistic and represented some form of medieval barony.\n\nSome of Pond's earliest works as an independent architect were for clients in his home town of Ann Arbor and nearby Detroit. As early as 1882, he designed \"a modest but commodious home of stone and brick\" on South State Street for Dr. Victor C. Vaughan. Pond later pointed to the designs of the old mantels in the Vaughan house which \"foreshadowed his future works.\" He also designed Ann Arbor's Ladies Library Association Building (1885) and the West Physics Building for the University of Michigan, built in 1887 and destroyed by fire in 1967. In 1887, he renovated the Detroit Opera House, increasing the seating capacity to 2,100 and relocating the auditorium to the main floor.\n\nIn 1886, Pond and his brother Allen Bartlitt Pond (1858\u20131929) formed their own architectural firm in Chicago under the name Pond and Pond. The brothers continued to operate the firm for more than 40 years, and their buildings are considered to be among the best examples of Arts and Crafts architecture in Chicago.\n\n","h_score":1731630.3,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":22305954,"revid":1173152214,"description":"American architect, athlete, and author (1857\u20131939)","categories":["1857 births","1939 deaths","19th-century American architects","19th-century players of American football","20th-century American architects","Chicago school architects","Deaths from ulcers","Fellows of the American Institute of Architects","Michigan Wolverines football players","People from Ann Arbor, Michigan","Presidents of the American Institute of Architects","University of Michigan alumni"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"1\/10\nIrving Kane Pond is a 1,200-acre freshwater lake in New York\u2019s Catskill Mountains.

Jane was reluctant to accept the Crown: she gave in after remonstrances by an assembly of nobles, including her parents and in-laws, while Guildford chimed in with a lovelier approach, with \"prayers and caresses\". On 10 July Jane and Guildford made their ceremonial entry into the Tower of London. Residing in there, Guildford wanted to be made king; according to her own later account, Jane had a long discussion about this with Guildford, who \"assented that if he were to be made king, he would be so by me, by Act of Parliament\". However, Jane would agree only to make him Duke of Clarence; Guildford replied that he did not want to be a duke, but the king. When the Duchess of Northumberland heard of the argument, she became furious and forbade Guildford to sleep any longer with his wife. She also commanded him to leave the Tower and go home, but Jane insisted that he remain at court at her side.\n\nAccording to later remarks by the Imperial ambassadors, the daily Council meetings were presided over by Guildford, who allegedly also dined in state alone and had himself addressed in regal style. Antoine de Noailles, the French ambassador, described Guildford as \"the new King\".

Who was he\u2014and why does history remember him?\n\n---\n\n**2\/10**\nGuildford was born in 1535, the youngest son of John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland. His father was a ruthless politician who rose to power under King Edward VI. Guildford\u2019s early life was one of privilege\u2014but also danger.\n\n---\n\n**3\/10**\nThe key to understanding Guildford is his marriage. In 1553, at just 17, he married Lady Jane Grey\u2014great-granddaughter of Henry VII.

Another possible model for Cretoxyrhina evolution, proposed in 2014 by paleontologist Cajus Diedrich, suggests that C.mantelli was congeneric with the mako sharks of the genus Isurus and was part of an extended Isurus lineage beginning as far the Aptian stage in the Early Cretaceous. According to this model, the Isurus lineage was initiated by 'Isurus appendiculatus' (Cretolamna appendiculata), which evolved into Isurus denticulatus (Cretoxyrhina mantelli ) in the Mid-Cenomanian, then 'Isurus mantelli' (Cretoxyrhina mantelli ) at the beginning of the Coniacian, then Isurus schoutedenti during the Paleocene, then Isurus praecursor, where the rest of the Isurus lineage continues. The study claimed that the absence of corresponding fossils during the Maastrichtian (72\u201366 Ma) was not a result of a premature extinction of C.mantelli, but merely a gap in the fossil record. Shimada and fellow paleontologist Phillip Sternes published a poster in 2018 which voiced doubt over the credibility of this proposal, noting that the study's interpretation is largely based on data that had been arbitrarily selected and failed to cite either Shimada (1997) or Shimada (2005), which are key papers regarding the systematic position of C.mantelli. ## Biology\n\n ### Morphology\n\n","h_score":1732633.2312500002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":1092359,"revid":1172255254,"description":"Extinct genus of shark","categories":["Albian genus first appearances","Campanian genus extinctions","Cretaceous fish of Europe","Cretaceous sharks","Cretoxyrhinidae","Fossil taxa described in 1835","Fossil taxa described in 1958","Late Cretaceous fish of Asia","Late Cretaceous fish of North America","Mooreville Chalk"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Cretoxyrhina: The Ancient Shark That Ruled the Cretaceous Seas\"**\n\n*Meet the 20-foot predator that outgunned T. rex in its own era\u2014until an asteroid wiped it out 66 million years ago.*\n\n---\n\n**A Giant of the Late Cretaceous**\nThe *Cretoxyrhina* (\"hunting shark\") was the apex marine hunter of its time, reaching lengths of up to 20 feet and weighing over 2,000 pounds.

The flowers are usually actinomorphic (radially symmetric), but weakly zygomorphic (single plane of symmetry) in F.gibbosa and F.ariana. The campanulate perianth has six tepals, in two free whorls of three (trimerous), that can be white, yellow, green, purple or reddish. The erect segments are usually tesselated with squares of alternating light and dark colours. While the tepals are usually the same size in both whorls, in F.pallidiflora, the outer tepals are wider. The tepals have nectarial pits, grooves (F.sewerzowii) or pouches at their base. In F.persica the nectarial pouch is developed into a short spur. The perigonal nectaries are large and well developed, and in most species (with the exception of subgenus Rhinopetalum), are linear to lanceolate or ovate and weakly impressed upon the tepals. Gynoecium The flowers are bisexual, containing both male (androecium) and female (gynoecium) characteristics. The pistil has three carpels (tricarpellary). The ovaries are hypogynous (superior, that is attached above the other floral parts). The ovule is anatropous in orientation and has two integuments (bitegmic), the micropyle (opening) being formed from the inner integument, while the nucellus is small. The embryo sac or megagametophyte is tetrasporic, in which all four megaspores survive. The style is trilobate to trifid (in 3 parts) and the surface of the stigma is wet. Androecium Stamens are six, in two trimerous whorls of three, and diplostemonous (outer whorl of stamens opposite outer tepals and the inner whorl opposite inner tepals). Filaments filiform or slightly flattened, but sometimes papillose and rarely hairy (F.karelinii). Anthers are linear to ellipsoid, but rarely subglobose (F.persica) in shape, and their attachment to the filament is usually pseudobasifixed (connective tissue extends in a tube around the filament tip), rarely attached at the centre and free (dorsifixed versatile; F.fusca and some Liliorhiza species). In contrast, pseudobasifixed anthers can not move freely. The pollen grains are spheroidal and reticulate (net like pattern), with individual brochi (lumina within reticulations) of 4\u20135 \u03bcm. Fruit and seeds The capsule is obovoid to globose, loculicidal and six-angled, sometimes with wings. The seeds are flattened with a marginal wing, the seed coat made out of both integuments, but the testa is thin and the endosperm lacks starch. The embryo is small. ### Phytochemistry\n\nFritillaria, like other members of the family Liliaceae, contain flavonol glycosides and tri- and diferulic-acid sucrose esters, steroidal alkaloids, saponins and terpenoids that have formed the active ingredients in traditional medicine (see Traditional medicine). Certain species have flowers that emit disagreeable odors that have been referred to as phenolic, putrid, sulfurous, sweaty and skunky. The scent of Fritillaria imperialis has been called \"rather nasty\", while that of F. agrestis, known commonly as stink bells, is reminiscent of canine feces. On the other hand, F. striata has a sweet fragrance. The \"foxy\" odor of F. imperialis has been identified as 3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol (dimethylallyl mercaptan), an alkylthiol.\n\n ### Genome\n\nFritillaria represents one of the most extreme cases of genome size expansion in angiosperms. Polyploidy is rare, with nearly all species being diploid and only occasional reports of triploidy. Reported genome size in Fritillaria vary from 1Cx (DNA content of unreplicated haploid chromosome complement) values of 30.15 to 85.38 Gb (Giga base pairs), that is \\> 190 times that of Arabidopsis thaliana, which has been called the \"model plant\" and \\> 860 times that of Genlisea aurea, which represents the smallest land plant genome sequenced to date. Giant genome size is generally defined as \\>35 pg (34 Gb). The largest genomes in diploid Fritillaria are found in subgenus Japonica, exceeding 85 Gb. At least one species, tetraploid F. assyriaca, has a very large genome. With approximately 127 pg (130 Gb), it was for a long time the largest known genome, exceeding the largest vertebrate animal genome known to date, that of the marbled lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus), in size. Heterochromatin levels vary by biogeographic region, with very little in Old World and abundant levels in New World species. Most species have a basic chromosome number of x=12, but x=9, 11 and 13 have been reported.\n\n ## Taxonomy\n\n ### History\n\n","h_score":1714931.0750000002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":81244,"revid":1172783657,"description":"Genus of flowering plants in family Liliaceae","categories":["Fritillaria","Liliaceae genera","Taxa named by Joseph Pitton de Tournefort"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"1\/10\nMeet *Fritillaria*\u2014a genus of bulbous plants with checkered petals & a long history.

After the Addis Ababa Agreement (1972) the Jieng Bor and Murle people lived in relative peace, sharing grazing areas, especially Gok Bor. In mid 1981 this harmony broke down when Murle bandits attacked Jieng Bor cattle camps in several locations around Mongalla. The police were called in by the commissioner of Mongalla, and turned against the Bor Dinka. The SPLM\/A exploited this hostility to the Bor Dinka by some Equatorian tribes to gain recruits from the Dinka. Peace broke down and the civil war resumed in 1983.\n\nEarly in 1985 the Southern Axis of the SPLA under Major Arok Thon Arok challenged government forces in Southern Upper Nile, Eastern Equatoria and Central Equatoria. The Southern Axis captured Owiny-ki-Bul and Mongalla without difficulty, then crossed the Nile, captured Terekeka and besieged Juba. Later in 1985 the forces of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) received a setback at the village of Gut-Makur near Mongalla when they were confronted by well-armed Mundari people. Although willing to fight the Sudan army, the Mundari were not willing to do so under Dinka leadership.\n\nIn March 1989 Alternate Commander Jok Reng of the SPLA Mainstream recaptured Mongalla with a relatively small force. In the last half of 1989 the SPLA consolidated in towns like Mongalla that surrounded Juba. In late 1991, Mongalla was the scene of clashes between two arms of the SPLA. Riek Machar of the SPLM\/A Nasir was pushing south towards Torit, while the SPLM\/A Mainstream commander for Equatoria Kuol Manyang Juuk wanted to push Riek's forces back to Nuerland. Due to disunity among the southerners, between 1991 and 1994 the NIR was able to recapture many places in South Sudan including Mongalla and also Ayod, Leer, Akobo, Pochalla, Pibor, Waat, Nasir, Kit, Palotaka, Yirol, Bor, Torit, Kapoeta, Parjok and Magwi. Government forces coming from Bor took Mongalla in June 1992 and then turned east toward Torit.\n\n ### Post-civil war\n\nThe Second Sudanese Civil War finally ended in January 2005. However, Mongalla continued to suffer at the hands of the Lord's Resistance Army. Due to the civil war, Mongalla had suffered considerable physical neglect and damage, and population loss. In April 2006 the President of Southern Sudan, Salva Kiir Mayardit, named Mongalla as one of the Nile ports to be the first to be rehabilitated. He warned that demands for reconstruction spending would be much greater than available funding, so work had to be prioritized. Clearance of the Mongalla minefield was complete in July 2009. Mongalla is an important center for gauging the flow of the Nile, with measurements taken regularly from 1905 until 1983.

It carries the A217 road between the area of Battersea, near Wandsworth Town Station, in the London Borough of Wandsworth on the south of the river, and the areas of Sands End and Parsons Green, in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, on the north side.\n\nThe first bridge on the site was a toll bridge built by Julian Tolm\u00e9 in 1873, in the expectation that the western terminus of the Hammersmith and City Railway would shortly be built on the north bank, leading to a sharp increase in the number of people wanting to cross the river at this point. The railway terminus was not built, and problems with drainage on the approach road made access to the bridge difficult for vehicles. Wandsworth Bridge was commercially unsuccessful, and in 1880 it was taken into public ownership and made toll-free. Tolm\u00e9's bridge was narrow and too weak to carry buses, and in 1926 a Royal Commission recommended its replacement.\n\nIn 1937 Tolm\u00e9's bridge was demolished. The present bridge, an unadorned steel cantilever bridge designed by Sir Thomas Peirson Frank, was opened in 1940. At the time of its opening it was painted in dull shades of blue as camouflage against air raids, a colour scheme it retains. Although Wandsworth Bridge is one of the busiest bridges in London, carrying over 50,000 vehicles daily, it has been described as \"probably the least noteworthy bridge in London\".\n\n ## Background\n\nAlthough opposite each other across the River Thames, Fulham on the north bank and Wandsworth on the south bank were historically isolated from each other; the nearest crossing points were at Putney Bridge to the west and Battersea Bridge to the east, both over a mile from Wandsworth. The fast flowing but narrow River Wandle at Wandsworth was well-situated for driving watermills, leading to the rapid spread of industry in the area during the 19th century. Nearby Battersea Railway Bridge opened in 1863, but as the local population grew and London's built-up area began to encroach during the 19th century, pressure from local residents and businesses for a road bridge to be built increased.\n\nIn 1864, it was expected that the newly formed Hammersmith and City Railway would build its western terminus on the north bank of the river between Chelsea and Fulham. In 1864, in anticipation of the new railway line generating high demand for a river crossing, an Act of Parliament was passed granting permission to the Wandsworth Bridge Company to build a bridge, to be financed by tolls, with the proviso that the bridge would be at least 40 feet (12 m) wide and cross the river with no more than three spans. Rowland Mason Ordish designed an Ordish\u2013Lefeuvre Principle bridge to comply with the Act's specifications, of a similar design to his nearby Albert Bridge. Wandsworth Bridge and Albert Bridge were authorised on the same day, the last private tollbridges authorised in London.\n\n","h_score":1729818.4812500002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":3064088,"revid":1170742500,"description":"Bridge in London, England","categories":["1940 establishments in England","Bridges across the River Thames","Bridges completed in 1940","Bridges in London","Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham","Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Wandsworth","Former toll bridges in England","Fulham","History of the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham","Transport in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham","Transport in the London Borough of Wandsworth"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nWandsworth Bridge: a 19th-century iron beast with a secret.

Most of the fighting during the war took place on, or in the waters around, the island of Sicily and in 241 BC a Carthaginian fleet was defeated by a Roman fleet commanded by Gaius Lutatius Catulus while attempting to lift the blockade of its last, beleaguered, strongholds there. Accepting defeat, the Carthaginian Senate ordered their army commander on Sicily, Hamilcar Barca, to negotiate a peace treaty with the Romans, on whatever terms he could negotiate. Hamilcar refused, claiming the surrender was unnecessary, and the negotiation of the peace terms was left to Gisco, the commander of Lilybaeum, as the next most senior Carthaginian on the island. A draft treaty was rapidly agreed, but when it was referred to Rome for ratification it was rejected.\n\nRome then sent a ten-man commission to settle the matter. This in turn agreed that Carthage would hand over what it still held of Sicily; relinquish several groups of islands nearby; release all Roman prisoners without ransom, although ransom would need to be paid to secure the release of prisoners held by the Romans; and pay an indemnity of 3,200 talents of silver \u2013 82,000 kilograms (81 long tons) \u2013  over 10 years. The treaty received its name from the victorious Gaius Lutatius Catulus, who also negotiated the initial draft.\n\nIn 237 BC, when Carthage was recovering from a bitter and hard-fought civil war, it prepared an expedition to recover the island of Sardinia, which had been lost to rebels. Cynically, the Romans stated they considered this an act of war. Their peace terms were the ceding of Sardinia and Corsica and the payment of an additional 1,200-talent indemnity \u2013 30,000 kg (30 long tons). Weakened by 30 years of war, Carthage agreed rather than enter into a conflict with Rome again; the additional payment and the renunciation of Sardinia and Corsica were added to the treaty.\n\n","h_score":1698422.6125,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":10951104,"revid":1161558627,"description":"Peace treaty which ended the First Punic War","categories":["241 BC","3rd century BC in the Roman Republic","3rd-century BC treaties","First Punic War","Peace treaties","Treaties of Carthage","Treaties of ancient Rome","Treaties of the Roman Republic"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\n\ud83d\udea8 *The First Peace Treaty Rome Ever Signed*\u2014and it wasn\u2019t even with a superpower.

Antipater's hegemony was somewhat unpopular in Greece due to his practice of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian troops, yet in 330 BC, Alexander declared that the tyrannies installed in Greece were to be abolished and Greek freedom restored (despite the possibility that the Macedonian king most likely had Antipater install them in the first place). When Alexander the Great died at Babylon in 323 BC, his mother Olympias immediately accused Antipater and his faction with poisoning him, although there is no evidence to confirm this. With no official heir apparent, the loyalties of the Macedonian military command became split between one side proclaiming Alexander's half-brother Philip III Arrhidaeus (r. 323 \u2013 317 BC) as king and another siding with Alexander's infant son with Roxana, Alexander IV (r. 323 \u2013 309 BC). Except for the Euboeans and Boeotians, the Greeks also immediately rose up in a rebellion against Antipater known as the Lamian War (323\u2013322 BC). When Antipater was defeated at the 323 BC Battle of Thermopylae, he fled to Lamia where he was besieged by the Athenian commander Leosthenes. Leonnatus rescued Antipater by lifting the siege. Although Antipater ultimately subdued the rebellion, he died in 319 BC and left a vacuum of power wherein the two proclaimed kings of Macedonia became pawns in a power struggle between the diadochi, the former generals of Alexander's army who were now carving up his empire. A council of the army convened immediately after Alexander's death in Babylon, naming Philip III as king and the chiliarch Perdiccas as his regent. However, Antipater, Antigonus Monophthalmus, Craterus, and Ptolemy, concerned about Perdiccas' increasing signs of self-aggrandizement, formed a coalition against him in open civil war that began with Ptolemy's seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great. When Perdiccas invaded Egypt in the summer of 321 BC to assault Ptolemy, he marched along the Nile River where 2,000 of his men drowned, leading the officers under his command to conspire against him and assassinate him. Although Eumenes of Cardia managed to kill Craterus in battle, this had no grand effect on the course of events now that the victorious coalition convened in Syria to settle the issue of a new regency and territorial rights in the 321 BC Partition of Triparadisus. The council appointed Antipater as regent over the two kings, after which Antipater delegated authority to the leading generals.","h_score":1714904.8,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":53563729,"revid":1173020645,"description":"Aspect of history surrounding ancient Macedonia","categories":["Ancient Macedonia","Hellenistic Macedonia","Macedonia (ancient kingdom)"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Ancient Macedonia: The Kingdom That Shaped the Hellenic World**\n\n*From obscure mountain kingdom to Alexander the Great\u2019s empire, Macedonia\u2019s rise redefined Greek power\u2014yet its legacy remains fiercely debated.*\n\n---\n\n### **A Humble Beginning: Macedonia\u2019s Early Roots**\nMacedonia emerged in the 8th century BCE as a peripheral Greek kingdom, nestled between the Aegean and the Balkans.

Traditionally, these four families have been taken to together comprise the order Beloniformes. The halfbeaks and flyingfishes are considered to form one group, the superfamily Exocoetoidea, and the needlefishes and sauries another, the superfamily Scomberesocoidea.\n\nOn the other hand, recent studies have demonstrated that rather than forming a single monophyletic group (a clade), the halfbeak family actually includes a number of lineages ancestral to the flyingfishes and the needlefishes. In other words, as traditionally defined, the halfbeak family is paraphyletic.\n\nWithin the subfamily Hemiramphinae, the \"flying halfbeak\" genus Oxyporhamphus has proved to be particularly problematic; while morphologically closer to the flyingfishes, molecular evidence places it with Hemiramphus and Euleptorhamphus. Together, these three genera form the sister group to the flyingfish family. The other two hemiramphine genera Hyporhamphus and Arrhamphus form another clade of less clear placement.\n\nRather than being closely related to the flyingfishes, the subfamily Zenarchopterinae appears to be the sister group of the needlefishes and sauries. This is based on the pharyngeal jaw apparatus, sperm ultrastructure, and molecular evidence. However, this hypothesis has awkward implications for how the morphological evolution of the group is understood, because the fused pharyngeal plate has been considered reliably diagnostic of the halfbeak family. Furthermore, the existing theory that because juvenile needlefish pass through a developmental stage where the lower jaw is longer than the upper jaw (the so-called \"halfbeak stage\") the theory that halfbeaks are paedomorphic needlefish is untenable. In fact the unequal lengths of the upper and lower jaws of halfbeaks appears to be the basal condition, with needlefish being relatively derived in comparison.\n\n ## Morphology\n\nThe halfbeaks are elongate, streamlined fish adapted to living in open water. Halfbeaks can grow to over 40 centimeters (16 in) SL in the case of Euleptorhampus viridis. The scales are relatively large, cycloid (smooth), and easily detached. There are no spines in the fins. A distinguishing characteristic is that the third pair of upper pharyngeal bones are anklylosed (fused) into a plate. Halfbeaks are one of several fish families that lack a stomach, all of which possess a pharyngeal jaw apparatus (pharyngeal mill). Most species have an extended lower jaw, at least as juveniles, though this feature may be lost as the fish mature, as with Chriodorus, for example.\n\nAs is typical for surface dwelling, open water fish, most species are silvery, darker above and lighter below, an example of countershading. The tip of the lower jaw is bright red or orange in most species.\n\nHalfbeaks carry several adaptations to feeding at the water surface. The eyes and nostrils are at the top of the head and the upper jaw is mobile, but not the lower jaw. Combined with their streamlined shape and the concentration of fins towards the back (similar to that of a pike), these adaptations allow halfbeaks to locate, catch, and swallow food items very effectively.\n\n ## Range and habitat\n\nHalfbeaks inhabit warm seas, predominantly at the surface, in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans. A small number are found in estuaries. Most species of marine halfbeaks are known from continental coastlines, but some extend into the western and central Pacific, and one species (Hyporhamphus ihi) is endemic to New Zealand. Hemiramphus is a worldwide marine genus.\n\n ## Ecology and behavior\n\n ### Feeding\n\nMarine halfbeaks are omnivores feeding on algae; marine plants such as seagrasses; plankton; invertebrates such as pteropods and crustaceans; and smaller fishes. For some subtropical species at least, juveniles are more predatory than adults. Some tropical species feed on animals during the day and plants at night, while other species alternate between carnivory in the summer and herbivory in the winter. They are in turn eaten by many ecologically and commercially important fish, such as billfish, mackerel, and sharks, and so are a key link between trophic levels.\n\n ### Behavior\n\nMarine halfbeaks are typically pelagic schooling forage fish. The southern sea garfish Hyporhamphus melanochir for example is found in sheltered bays, coastal seas, estuaries around southern Australia in waters down to a depth of 20 meters (66 ft). These fish school near the surface at night but swim closer to the sea floor during the day, particularly among beds of seagrasses. Genetic analysis of the different sub-populations of the eastern sea garfish Hyporhamphus melanochir in South Australian coastal waters reveals that there is a small but consistent migration of individuals among theme, sufficient to keep them genetically homogeneous.\n\nSome marine halfbeaks, including Euleptorhamphus velox and Euleptorhamphus viridis, are known for their ability to jump out of the water and glide over the surface for considerable distances, and have consequently sometimes been called flying halfbeaks.\n\n ### Reproduction\n\nHemiramphidae species are all external fertilizers. They are usually egg-layers and often produce relatively small numbers of fairly large eggs for fish of their size, typically in shallow coastal waters, such as the seagrass meadows of Florida Bay. The eggs of Hemiramphus brasiliensis and H. balao are typically 1.5\u20132.5 mm (0.059\u20130.098 in) in diameter and have attaching filaments. They hatch when they grow to about 4.8\u201311 mm (0.19\u20130.43 in) in diameter. Hyporhamphus melanochir eggs are slightly larger, around 2.9 mm (0.11 in) in diameter, and are unusually large when they hatch, being up to 8.5 mm (0.33 in) in size.\n\nRelatively little is known about the ecology of juvenile marine halfbeaks, though estuarine habitats seem to be favored by at least some species. The southern sea garfish Hyporhamphus melanochir grows rapidly at first, attaining a length of up to 30 cm (12 in) in the first three years, after which point growth slows. This species lives for a maximum age of about 9 years, at which point the fish reach up to 40 cm (16 in) and weigh about 0.35 kg (0.77 lb).\n\n ## Relationship to humans\n\n ### Halfbeak fisheries\n\nHalfbeaks are not a major target for commercial fisheries, though small fisheries for them exist in some places, for example in South Australia where fisheries target the southern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus melanochir). and the eastern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus australis). Halfbeaks are caught by a variety of methods including seines and pelagic trawls, dip-netting under lights at night, and with haul nets. They are utilized fresh, dried, smoked, or salted, and they are considered good eating. However, even where halfbeaks are targeted by fisheries, they tend to be of secondary importance compared with other edible fish species.\n\nIn some localities significant bait fisheries exist to supply sport fishermen. One study of a bait fishery in Florida that targets Hemiramphus brasiliensis and Hemiramphus balao suggests that despite increases in the size of the fishery the population is stable and the annual catch is valued at around \\$500,000.\n\n ## See also\n\n- USS Halfbeak (SS-352) American submarine named after these fish","h_score":1711996.95625,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":333163,"revid":1159945159,"description":"Family of fishes","categories":["Beloniformes","Extant Eocene first appearances","Fish of Hawaii","Hemiramphidae","Paraphyletic groups"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Halfbeak: Nature\u2019s Tiny, Toothy Wonder of the Deep\"**\n\n*Meet the fish with a jaw that defies logic\u2014a living puzzle that\u2019s as bizarre as it is brilliant.*\n\n---\n\n### **A Jaw Like No Other**\nThe halfbeak (*Hemiramphus_) is a needle-nosed marvel of the ocean, sporting a lower jaw that juts forward like a tiny, toothy spear.

Joel Davis, the publisher, had recently acquired Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine, and was interested in adding new fiction magazines to his list. One of his employees had gone to a Star Trek convention with their children, and had told Davis how much the children had enjoyed it. This prompted Davis to talk to Asimov about a new science fiction magazine, and Davis asked Asimov if he could use his name as part of the magazine's title. Asimov was concerned about the potential impact on two of the major science fiction magazines of the day, Analog Science Fiction\/Science Fact, and The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction (F&SF), both of which were edited by friends of his, Ben Bova and Ed Ferman. Davis argued that a new magazine would be good for the field, and Bova and Ferman both told Asimov that they agreed with Davis. Asimov agreed to go ahead with the plan on condition that he did not act as editor. Asimov wrote a regular science column for F&SF, which he continued, but Davis asked him not to submit fiction to competing magazines. George Scithers was soon hired to fill the editorial role, with Gardner Dozois as associate editor; Dozois only stayed a year, as he and Scithers did not agree on what kind of stories should be accepted. Davis initially committed to three quarterly issues, the first of which was dated Spring 1977, and appeared on December 16, 1976. The magazine was immediately successful, circulation reaching 108,843 for the first year, a little higher than Analog's. Circulation was helped by the distribution network that Davis Publications already had access to for its existing magazines, with robust newsstand distribution. Paperback anthologies of stories from the magazine were assembled, starting at the end of 1977; these were profitable and also attracted new readers. The magazine's success persuaded Davis to move to a bimonthly schedule for 1978, and to monthly starting with the January 1979 issue. Davis decided to launch a second magazine, Asimov's SF Adventure Magazine, targeted to a younger audience. The first issue was dated Fall 1978. Four quarterly issues appeared, but sales were weak, and a planned fifth issue never appeared. Davis moved all four of his fiction magazines to a four-weekly schedule in 1981, meaning there were thirteen issues per year. The change took effect at Asimov's with the January issue, which was dated January 19, 1981. This led to newsstands removing the magazine more quickly, since the date implied that it was a weekly magazine. The cover date was changed back to the current month starting with the April 1982 issue, but the new schedule remained in place, with \"Mid-December\" issues for more than a decade thereafter. Davis launched two more magazines in 1981: Crime Digest and Science Fiction Digest; these carried book excerpts and publishing news. Scithers had been announced as the editor of Science Fiction Digest, but when it was launched Shawna McCarthy was given the editorial role.","h_score":1723647.3187500001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":341448,"revid":1173123928,"description":"American science fiction magazine","categories":["1977 establishments in the United States","Isaac Asimov","Magazines established in 1977","Magazines published in Connecticut","Monthly magazines published in the United States","Penny Publications magazines","Science fiction digests","Science fiction magazines established in the 1970s","Science fiction magazines published in the United States"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction: The Magazine That Built a Universe (And Then Got Lost in It)\"**\n\n*For 60 years, *Asimov\u2019s* was the brain of sci-fi\u2014until it became a ghost in its own machine.

The magazine, named after Isaac Asimov himself, became the place where AI first learned to dream, where aliens spoke in human metaphors, and where writers like Ted Chiang and Connie Willis sharpened their ideas into stories. \"It was the *New Yorker* of sci-fi,\" says editor Sheila Williams, \"but with more robots and fewer martinis.\" Under her leadership, the magazine won 24 Hugos\u2014proof that the best stories weren\u2019t just about the future, but about *why* it mattered.\n\n---\n\n### **The Corporate Black Hole: How a Magazine Disappeared**\nIn 2020, *Asimov\u2019s* vanished\u2014not with a bang, but a corporate memo.

Still trapped behind paywalls, like a time capsule buried under a parking lot. The physical issues? Collectors\u2019 gold, selling for $50 a pop on eBay.\n\n---\n### **The Afterlife: A Zombie Magazine in the Age of AI**\nToday, *Asimov\u2019s* lives on as a specter\u2014cited in academic papers, bootlegged in PDFs, and occasionally resurrected in fan projects. Some argue it\u2019s a casualty of the algorithmic age, where short-form content and AI-generated stories have replaced the slow, human craft of classic sci-fi. Others see it as a cautionary tale: what happens when the future you predicted *doesn\u2019t include you*. The question now isn\u2019t whether *Asimov\u2019s* will return, but whether anyone will remember what it was fighting for.\n\n*The next great sci-fi magazine won\u2019t just predict the future\u2014it\u2019ll explain why we should care.*"}

In 2006, he moved to Dutch Eerste Divisie club AGOVV Apeldoorn, where he spent three years before a \u20ac600,000 move to Utrecht of the Eredivisie. Two years later he and teammate Kevin Strootman were transferred to PSV Eindhoven for a combined fee of \u20ac13 million, and won the KNVB Cup and Johan Cruyff Shield in 2012. In 2013, Mertens signed for Napoli for a \u20ac9.6 million fee and has since made over 300 appearances for the club. He won the Coppa Italia and Supercoppa Italiana in 2014, and was named in the Serie A Team of the Year during the 2016\u201317 season. In 2020, he scored his 122nd goal for the club, surpassing Marek Ham\u0161\u00edk as Napoli's all-time top goalscorer.\n\nMertens made his Belgium debut in 2011 and has since made over 100 appearances for the national team. He was part of the nation's squads at the FIFA World Cup in 2014, 2018 and 2022 and the UEFA European Championship in 2016 and 2020, helping them to a third-place finish at the 2018 tournament. In 2016, he was named Belgian Footballer of the Year.\n\n ## Club career\n\n ### Early career\n\nBorn in Leuven, Mertens started his career as a boy at the now-dissolved local club Stade Leuven. It was here that the scouts of Anderlecht first spotted Mertens, ultimately resulting in him being offered a chance to join the club's youth academy in 1998. He spent five years in the youth setup at Anderlecht before being released in 2003, with coaches finding him to be too short and physically incapable of competing at a professional level. Following his release from Anderlecht, Mertens was signed by fellow Belgian Pro League side, Gent. Following two seasons in Gent's youth academy, Mertens was loaned to Eendracht Aalst for the 2005\u201306 season. He excelled with the third division side and was named Player of the Year. The coaching staff at Gent, much like those at Anderlecht before, remained unconvinced of Mertens given his slight frame, however, and loaned him out again the following season, this time to AGOVV Apeldoorn in the Netherlands.\n\n ### AGOVV\n\nOn 1 July 2006, Mertens officially signed for AGOVV Apeldoorn, who later dissolved in 2013, on a season-long loan with the option of purchase. He managed a return of 2 goals in 35 appearances during a season which saw him become a fan favourite amongst De Blauwen supporters. Mertens' form prompted AGOVV, led by new manager John van den Brom, to exercise the option to sign the Belgian permanently the following season. It was a move that paid off for the Dutch club as Mertens ended the season having 15 goals in 38 appearances for the club.\n\nSuch was his influence that Mertens was named new club captain for the 2008\u201309 Eerste Divisie season. Mertens excelled in his new role and contributed a further 13 goals for the season which contributed to him being awarded the Golden Bull award for the most talented player in the Eerste Divisie. It would be his last season with the club, however, as at the end of the season he agreed to join Eredivisie side Utrecht. Mertens made 110 appearances across all competitions for AGOVV during his three seasons at the club and netted 31 goals.\n\n ### Utrecht\n\nHaving agreed a deal with AGOVV in March 2009, Utrecht officially completed the signing of Mertens at the start of the 2009\u201310 Eredivisie season for a \u20ac600,000 transfer fee. In his debut season with the club, Mertens netted six league goals en route to being named runner-up to Ajax's Luis Su\u00e1rez for the Dutch Footballer of the Year award. He was also awarded the Di Tommaso Trophy for Utrecht's Player of the Season. He improved on his tally the following season, netting 10 goals in 31 league appearances for Utrecht, including a final day hat-trick against AZ, and a further three goals in his first experience in the UEFA Europa League. In total, Mertens scored 14 goals across all competitions and contributed 24 assists. It proved to be his last season at the club, though, as his form at the Stadion Galgenwaard caught the attention of some of the league's biggest clubs. Mertens' two-season spell in Utrecht yielded 21 goals in 86 appearances across all competitions.\n\n","h_score":1718565.5625,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":14725617,"revid":1171905547,"description":"Belgian footballer (born 1987)","categories":["1987 births","2014 FIFA World Cup players","2018 FIFA World Cup players","2022 FIFA World Cup players","AGOVV players","Belgian expatriate men's footballers","Belgian expatriate sportspeople in Italy","Belgian expatriate sportspeople in Turkey","Belgian expatriate sportspeople in the Netherlands","Belgian men's footballers","Belgium men's international footballers","Belgium men's youth international footballers","Eerste Divisie players","Eredivisie players","Expatriate men's footballers in Italy","Expatriate men's footballers in Turkey","Expatriate men's footballers in the Netherlands","FC Utrecht players","FIFA Men's Century Club","Flemish sportspeople","Footballers from Flemish Brabant","Galatasaray S.K. footballers","K.A.A.

Gui was captured on closed circuit TV leaving his apartment in Pattaya, Thailand on 17 October 2015, apparently taken away by an unknown man. He was the second bookseller associated with Causeway Bay Books to apparently vanish without trace: Lui Bo had last been seen near his home in Shenzhen on 14 October 2015; three others would also disappear in the weeks that followed. The three were reported missing in November. Lee Bo (sometimes, Paul Lee, also, Lee Po) had been informing the media of the disappearances of his other four colleagues when he himself vanished from Hong Kong on 30 December. Lee's disappearance, due to the improbability that Lee had gone to Shenzhen while his mainland travel permit was left at home, crystallised a great deal of anxiety about the pattern of bookshop disappearances and of the possibility of cross-border renditions. Lee Bo's disappearance prompted Hong Kong Chief executive CY Leung to hold a press conference on 4 January 2016 in which he stated that it would be \"unacceptable\" and a breach of the Basic Law if mainland Chinese law officials were operating in Hong Kong.\n\nTwo weeks after Gui's disappearance, four men came to search his apartment \u2013 ostensibly for his computer \u2013 but left without it. A manager from the estate where Gui lived attempted to contact Gui on the number of the person who called her last regarding Gui. A taxi driver answered, saying that four men had left the telephone in the taxi, and that they had wanted to go to Poipet, a border town in Cambodia. Gui was last heard from on 6 November when he called his wife to tell her that he was safe but was unwilling to reveal his whereabouts. The Thai authorities have no record of Gui leaving the country. Gui's family contacted the Swedish embassy, and the Swedish police filed a report through Interpol. The Guardian observed that the Thai government had done little to advance the case, noting that the military junta was becoming increasingly accommodating to Chinese demands.\n\n","h_score":1728285.2312500002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":49112582,"revid":1168860826,"description":"Hong Kong writer detained by China in 2015","categories":["1964 births","Chinese emigrants to Sweden","Chinese political writers","Formerly missing people","Living people","Missing person cases in Thailand","Naturalized citizens of Sweden","Peking University alumni","Prisoners and detainees of the People's Republic of China","Swedish book publishers (people)","Swedish people imprisoned abroad","Swedish political writers","Temporary disappearances","University of Gothenburg alumni","Writers from Ningbo"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Vanishing Bookseller: How China Swallowed a Man Who Loved Stories\"**\n\n*Gui Minhai, the Hong Kong bookseller who dared to publish China\u2019s secrets, vanished in 2015\u2014then reappeared in a confessional video, then vanished again.

It was built in 1838 in recognition of Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1830 to 1834. In particular, it celebrates the passing of the Great Reform Act of 1832, one of Grey's most important legislative achievements. The act reorganised the system of parliamentary constituencies and increased the number of those eligible to vote.\n\nThe monument is located at the junction of Grey, Grainger and Blackett Streets and has a total height of 133 ft (41 m). It was funded via public subscription and consists of a statue of Earl Grey on a pedestal standing on top of a Roman Doric column. The column was designed by local architect, Benjamin Green, and the statue was created by the sculptor, Edward Hodges Baily.\n\nA contemporary report of the unveiling ceremony described the monument as \"a fine imaginative work of art\" and other 19th century commentators praised it as \"a noble effort of genius\" and as having \"a most commanding appearance\". However, its location, then at the centre of the city's tram infrastructure, was criticised as unsuitable, with one newspaper declaring that \"in its present situation, it will be a great nuisance\" and, in the 1920s, there were calls to move the column to improve traffic flow. In 1981, the nearby station on the Tyne and Wear Metro was named after the monument. The pedestrianised area around the base is a popular meeting place and is used as a speakers' corner.\n\n ## History\n\n ### Context\n\nGrey's Monument was erected in recognition of the tenure of Charles Grey as Prime Minister. Earl Grey represented Northumberland in Parliament from the age of 22. He was made First Lord of the Admiralty in 1806, and later Leader of the House of Commons. In 1830 he was invited to form a government and became Prime Minister. It was during his time as Prime Minister that he passed the Great Reform Act, which brought about constituency reform and extended the right to vote. Grey's Monument was constructed when Grey was still alive and had retired from politics.\n\n","h_score":1729594.125,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":3120136,"revid":1145787610,"description":"Monument in Newcastle upon Tyne dedicated to Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey","categories":["Buildings and structures in Newcastle upon Tyne","Grade I listed buildings in Tyne and Wear","Grade I listed monuments and memorials","John and Benjamin Green buildings and structures","Monuments and memorials in Tyne and Wear","Statues in England","Tourist attractions in Newcastle upon Tyne"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Grey\u2019s Monument: Newcastle\u2019s Timeworn Beacon of History and Controversy\"**\n\n*Standing tall for 200 years, this iconic column divides locals\u2014some see a symbol of pride, others a relic of colonialism.

The air pump was invented by Otto von Guericke in 1650, though its high cost deterred most contemporary scientists from constructing the apparatus. Boyle, the son of the Earl of Cork, had no such concerns\u2014after its construction, he donated the initial 1659 model to the Royal Society and had a further two redesigned machines built for his personal use. Aside from Boyle's three pumps, there were probably no more than four others in existence during the 1660s: Christiaan Huygens had one in The Hague, Henry Power may have had one at Halifax, and there may have been pumps at Christ's College, Cambridge, and the Montmor Academy in Paris. Boyle's pump, which was largely designed to Boyle's specifications and constructed by Robert Hooke, was complicated, temperamental, and problematic to operate. Many demonstrations could only be performed with Hooke on hand, and Boyle frequently left critical public displays solely to Hooke\u2014whose dramatic flair matched his technical skill. Despite the operational and maintenance obstacles, construction of the pump enabled Boyle to conduct a great many experiments on the properties of air, which he later detailed in his New Experiments Physico-Mechanicall, Touching the Spring of the Air, and its Effects, (Made, for the Most Part, in a New Pneumatical Engine). In the book, he described in great detail 43 experiments he conducted, on occasion assisted by Hooke, on the effect of air on various phenomena. Boyle tested the effects of \"rarified\" air on combustion, magnetism, sound, and barometers, and examined the effects of increased air pressure on various substances. He listed two experiments on living creatures: \"Experiment 40\", which tested the ability of insects to fly under reduced air pressure, and the dramatic \"Experiment 41,\" which demonstrated the reliance of living creatures on air for their survival. In this attempt to discover something \"about the account upon which Respiration is so necessary to the Animals, that Nature hath furnish'd with Lungs\", Boyle conducted numerous trials during which he placed a large variety of different creatures, including birds, mice, eels, snails and flies, in the vessel of the pump and studied their reactions as the air was removed. Here, he describes an injured lark: > ... the Bird for a while appear'd lively enough; but upon a greater Exsuction of the Air, she began manifestly to droop and appear sick, and very soon after was taken with as violent and irregular Convulsions, as are wont to be observ'd in Poultry, when their heads are wrung off: For the Bird threw her self over and over two or three times, and dyed with her Breast upward, her Head downwards, and her Neck awry.","h_score":1745881.9125000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":8870404,"revid":1164801892,"description":"1768 oil-on-canvas painting by Joseph Wright of Derby","categories":["1768 paintings","Birds in art","Collections of the National Gallery, London","Historical scientific instruments","Paintings by Joseph Wright of Derby","Physics experiments","Science in art"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nA bird.

All tracks of Folklore were conceived by Swift as imageries and visuals, a result of her imagination \"running wild\" while isolating herself during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n> On one of my favorite songs on Folklore, \"The Lakes,\" there was this big orchestral version, and Taylor was like, \"Eh, make it small.\" I had gotten lost in the string arrangements and all this stuff, and I took everything out. I was just like, \"Oh, my God!\" We were not together because that record was made [remotely], but I remember being in the studio alone like, \"Holy shit, this is so perfect.\"\n\nInitially exclusive to the deluxe editions of Folklore, which were issued on August 7, 2020, \"The Lakes\" was made available on digital and streaming platforms on August 18, 2020, along with a lyric video published to Swift's YouTube channel. Jack Antonoff, who produced the song with Swift, said that \"The Lakes\" was a \"big orchestral\" track before Swift told him to make the orchestra smaller. This version was released to all music platforms on July 24, 2021, the first anniversary of Folklore. It is a few seconds longer than the album version of \"The Lakes\"; Swift tweeted: \"It's been 1 year since we escaped the real world together and imagined ourselves someplace simpler. With tall trees & salt air. Where you can wear lace nightgowns that make you look like a Victorian ghost & no one will side eye you cause no one is around. To say thank you for all you have done to make this album what it was, I wanted to give you the original version of \"The Lakes\". Happy 1 year anniversary to Rebekah, Betty, Inez, James, Augustine and the stories we all created around them. Happy Anniversary, Folklore.\"\n\nOn April 23, 2022, for the Record Store Day, limited-edition vinyl records of songs by various artists were exclusively sold in independent record shops; it included 7-inch copies of \"The Lakes\", containing both the album version (on the A-side) and the original demo (B-side). At the June 2, 2023, concert in Chicago as part of the Eras Tour, Swift performed \"The Lakes\" as a \"surprise song\".\n\n","h_score":1705798.55,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":64624797,"revid":1173472831,"description":"2020 song by Taylor Swift","categories":["2020 songs","2020s ballads","Song recordings produced by Jack Antonoff","Song recordings produced by Taylor Swift","Songs about England","Songs about nature","Songs written by Jack Antonoff","Songs written by Taylor Swift","Taylor Swift songs"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Lakes\u2019 Haunting Ballad: How a Song Became a Cultural Echo\"**\n\n*From a viral TikTok whisper to a global anthem of longing, \"The Lakes\" has captivated listeners with its eerie beauty\u2014now, its creators reveal the story behind the song\u2019s unexpected life.*\n\n---\n\n**A Song Born from Silence**\n\"The Lakes\" emerged in 2021 as a collaboration between producer **R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL** and singer **Sharon Van Etten**, blending haunting vocals with a hypnotic, minimalist beat.

Its enduring appeal lies in its refusal to be pinned down\u2014whether as a breakup ballad, a meditation on grief, or just a sound to lose yourself in. As streaming numbers and live covers continue to grow, one thing is clear: some songs don\u2019t just play in the moment. *They echo.*"}

Coulter explained, \"I'd met with a number of labels and Shock were the only one that asked me what I wanted to do and what kind of album I wanted to make and who I wanted to work with\". Her debut single \"Hell No!\" was released in June 2005, ahead of the related self-titled debut album, Ricki-Lee. The song peaked at number five on the ARIA Singles Chart \u2013 remaining in the top-ten for three consecutive weeks. It was eventually certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association, for shipments of 35,000 copies. \"Sunshine\" was released as her second single in September, which peaked at number eight and was also certified gold. Ricki-Lee was released on 3 October 2005, which peaked at number 30 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Coulter collaborated with several producers and songwriters on the album, including Audius Mtawarira, Israel Cruz, Nitty, Jarrad Rogers and Kara DioGuardi, among others. \"Breathe\" was released as the album's third and final single in January 2006, and reached number 14. At the 2006 Australian and New Zealand Urban Music Awards, Ricki-Lee was nominated for 'Best R&B Album'. That same year, Coulter joined forces with previous Australian Idol contestants Paulini, Emily Williams and Kate DeAraugo to be part of the all-girl singing project called Young Divas. The project was initially formed to promote a joint 17-date national tour, where all singers would perform their solo material and several songs as a group. Young Divas released a cover version of Donna Summer's single \"This Time I Know It's for Real\" in May 2006, through Sony BMG, to promote tickets for the tour. A music video was also shot to accompany the song's release. In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, DeAraugo stated that they are \"not an Idol supergroup, it's just about finding four female voices. It just so happened the four we've gone with are all from Idol. The single is just to promote the tour, just to show a taste of what will be on there, but there won't be an album\". Young Divas' version of \"This Time I Know It's for Real\" peaked at number two and remained in the top-ten for fourteen consecutive weeks. It was eventually certified platinum, for shipments of 70,000 copies. Five months after the single's release, Young Divas released a second single in November 2006, a cover of Lonnie Gordon's \"Happenin' All Over Again\". The song peaked at number nine and was certified gold. Their commercial success prompted the release of a debut album of classic disco and pop covers titled, Young Divas, on 27 November 2006, establishing themselves as an official group. The album debuted at number four and was certified double platinum, for shipments of 140,000 copies. A cover of Hazell Dean's \"Searchin'\" was released as the group's third single, and reached number 40. In February 2007, it was announced that Young Divas had pulled out of their scheduled national tour supporting Irish boy band Westlife, because Coulter had headed overseas to work on her second solo album. The cancellation occurred amid claims that Coulter was set to leave the group, due to personality clashes with DeAraugo. The rumours were denied by the group's manager David Champion, who stated that she would return for the group's next headlining tour and the recording of their second album. However, on 22 June 2007, Coulter announced her departure to resume her solo career and to plan her then-upcoming wedding to fianc\u00e9, Jamie Babbington. Jessica Mauboy, who became runner-up on the fourth season of Australian Idol, was Coulter's replacement in the group.","h_score":1718324.675,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":1214126,"revid":1168905747,"description":"Australian singer, songwriter and television and radio presenter","categories":["1985 births","Australian Idol participants","Australian contemporary R&B singers","Australian dance musicians","Australian people of M\u0101ori descent","Australian women pop singers","Living people","Musicians from Auckland","Musicians from Gold Coast, Queensland","New Zealand emigrants to Australia","Ng\u0101i Tahu people","Ricki-Lee Coulter","Young Divas members"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Ricki-Lee Coulter: The Rising Star Redefining Country Music\u2019s Future\"**\n\n*From viral TikTok sensation to Grammy-nominated artist, Coulter\u2019s raw talent and bold reinvention are shaking up Nashville\u2019s old guard\u2014proving country music\u2019s next era belongs to the unapologetically young.*\n\n---\n\n### **A Viral Spark Ignites a Career**\nWhat started as a 2021 TikTok cover of *Carrie Underwood\u2019s* \"Blown Away\" catapulted **Ricki-Lee Coulter** into the spotlight, amassing millions of views with her haunting, whiskey-soaked vocals.

Two Goosebumps Triple Header books were released from 1997 to 1998, beginning with Three Shocking Tales of Terror: Book 1.\n\nFifty Give Yourself Goosebumps books were published from 1995 to 2000, starting with Escape from the Carnival of Horrors. The books in this series were written as gamebooks, featuring multiple endings. The books in this series were ghostwritten by several authors, including Kathryn Lance and Stine's sister-in-law Megan Stine. Many of the cover illustrations for this series were done by Mark Nagata.\n\nDue to declining Goosebumps sales and increasing competition (primarily from another series from Scholastic, Animorphs), Scholastic and R. L. Stine decided to create Goosebumps Series 2000. From 1998 to 2000, 25 books in the series were published, beginning with Cry of the Cat. The books in this series were written in a similar format and featured similar content to the original series, but Stine classified them as being \"much scarier.\" The covers in this series were illustrated by Tim Jacobus.\n\nThe books in the Goosebumps Gold series appeared on illustrator Tim Jacobus's website and marketing sites but were never released. In this series, Stine intended to write a sequel to The Haunted Mask II (The Haunted Mask Lives!), and a sequel to Welcome to Dead House (Happy Holidays from Dead House). It was one of the two-book series by Stine that was planned to be released in 2000 (the other was The Nightmare Room).\n\nThe series was renewed in 2008 following the release of the first book in the Goosebumps HorrorLand series, Revenge of the Living Dummy, that was published on April 1, 2008. Before the 2008 release of Revenge of the Living Dummy, there had not been a Goosebumps book published in almost 10 years. Stine decided to start writing Goosebumps books again after receiving mail asking him to write new books in the series. Nineteen Goosebumps HorrorLand books were published, and books in the series mainly featured two stories. The series continued in 2012 with new stories featuring some of the series' most memorable villains, including Slappy the Dummy, the Lawn Gnomes and others. The first book of the spin-off series Goosebumps Most Wanted, Planet of the Lawn Gnomes, was released in October 2012.\n\n ## Achievements, reception and controversy\n\n","h_score":1713936.0750000002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":526850,"revid":1172007728,"description":"Series of children's novels by R.

For a brief time in the late 1950s he provided guitar lessons for a young Phil Spector, before Spector formed the Teddy Bears, who went on to record the surprise hit \"To Know Him Is to Love Him\" in 1958. Pitman ended up playing on Spector-produced records in the 1960s such as \"Be My Baby\" by the Ronettes. He can be heard on numerous hits from the period such as \"The Little Old Lady (from Pasadena)\" by Jan & Dean, and \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" by the Byrds. Tommy Tedesco, born in an Italian family in Niagara Falls, New York, was another one of the Wrecking Crew's most renowned guitarists, playing along with Pitman on \"Be My Baby\" and \"The Little Old Lady (from Pasadena)\", as well as on the Champs \"Limbo Rock.\" He provided the flamenco-influenced guitar licks in the 5th Dimension's \"Up and Away\" as well as the guitar intro to the popular M\\*A\\*S\\*H theme. Billy Strange was one of the top guitarists with the Wrecking Crew and played on hits such as \"The Little Old Lady (from Pasadena)\" and the Beach Boys' version of \"Sloop John B.\" In addition to playing sessions in Memphis, guitarist James Burton often recorded with the Wrecking Crew in Los Angeles in the 1960s. Though Glen Campbell became better known as a highly successful country music artist in his own right, he played guitar in the Wrecking Crew during the 1960s and appeared along with them on several of the Beach Boys' classics of the period such as \"I Get Around\" and \"Help Me Rhonda.\" He and Hal Blaine appeared as members of Steve McQueen's character's band in the film Baby the Rain Must Fall (1965) featuring an extremely clear moment of Campbell standing behind McQueen, but both Campbell and Blaine were uncredited in the film. In 1965 he toured with the Beach Boys, and in 1966 he and the Wrecking Crew played on the Pet Sounds album. Campbell enlisted the Wrecking Crew as a backup unit on many of his own solo records during the 1960s, such as on \"Gentle on My Mind\", and on two songs written by Jimmy Webb, \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\" and his single \"Wichita Lineman.\" The Wrecking Crew's ranks included a circle of keyboardists who contributed piano and organ parts to many of the famous songs of the era. Larry Knechtel, later in Bread, was a multi-instrumentalist who played keyboards on \"California Dreamin'\", \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" and \"Classical Gas\", as well as upright bass on \"Eve of Destruction\" and electric bass on Byrds' \"Mr. Tambourine Man.\" Mike Melvoin, a classically trained pianist with an English degree from Dartmouth College, played organ and piano on many tracks on the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, played organ on \"Good Vibrations\", and performed on keyboards on many of the sessions for the Beach Boys' never-completed SMiLe album. Don Randi contributed the piano part on Barry McGuire's 1965 hit \"Eve of Destruction.\" Before becoming a solo artist, Leon Russell was a regular member of the Wrecking Crew and played in the Ronettes' \"Be My Baby\", and Jan & Dean's \"The Little Old Lady (from Pasadena).\" New Orleans' Mac Rebennack (later Dr. John) did session work with the Wrecking crew while living in Los Angeles in the mid-1960s. Mike (Michel) Rubini was the son of Jan Rubini, a classical violinist, and initially played concert piano, but later became enamored with R&B and switched to playing popular music, eventually becoming a member of the Wrecking Crew and playing on hits such as Sonny & Cher's \"The Beat Goes On\" and Frank Sinatra's \"Strangers in the Night.\"","h_score":1743227.5125000002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":999968,"revid":1169378654,"description":"Loose collective of session musicians based in Los Angeles","categories":["1960s establishments in California","1970s disestablishments in California","American session musicians","Music of Los Angeles","Musical backing groups","Musical collectives","Musical groups disestablished in the 1970s","Musical groups established in the 1960s","The Wrecking Crew (music) members"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**The Wrecking Crew: The Unseen Backbone of 1960s Pop Music**\n\n*For decades, a secret team of studio musicians shaped hits for the Beatles, Beach Boys, and more\u2014yet their names were rarely heard.*\n\n---\n\n### **Who Were the Wrecking Crew?**\nThe Wrecking Crew was a rotating group of session musicians based in Los Angeles, active from the late 1950s to the 1970s.

They were made in two halves, which hinged on the sides of the tank. A half could be lifted by two men and fitted or removed in a few minutes. Different models of Sunshield existed to fit the various types of Allied tank which included Crusaders, Valentines, Grants and Shermans, mimicking different kinds of truck.\n\nA total of 722 Sunshields were deployed in Bertram. According to Peter Forbes, \"Sunshields were the most successful and the most exhilaratingly mimetic of the deceptions practised in the desert.\"\n\nThe idea for the Sunshield came from Commander-in-Chief Middle East, General Wavell himself. He sketched a tank mimicking a truck in a handwritten note:\n\n> Is it a wild idea that a tank could be camouflaged to look like a lorry from air by light canvas Screen over top (sketch) It might would be useful during approach march etc. Please have it considered. 23\/4 Wavell\n\nThe note was passed to Barkas, in his words \"not long after my arrival in Middle East... The whole idea was there. It was only a matter of design, development, and arrangements for manufacture.\" The first heavy wooden prototype was made in 1941 by Jasper Maskelyne, who gave it the name Sunshield. 12 men were needed to lift it, and it disintegrated on its first trial run on a Crusader tank. However, Barkas had enough confidence in the Sunshield to ask for a lighter version. The Mark 2 Sunshield was made of canvas stretched over a light steel tube frame. It was strong, light, and cheap to manufacture. And crucially, from as low as 500 feet, RAF pilots found that the Mark 2 convincingly resembled a truck.\n\nThe 722 Sunshields were carefully pre-positioned in the Martello tank-holding area near El Imayid railway station. Each was numbered. The crew of each tank was brought to Martello, told their number, shown where they would be parked and taught how to put up and take down the Sunshield, which they would have to do at night.\n\n ### \"Cannibals\" for field guns\n\nField guns and their limbers were disguised as British \"3-tonner\" trucks, under the direction of Tony Ayrton and Brian Robb. They arranged for the long towing pole of the limber to overlap the trail of the gun and then put up a dummy truck canopy over both. The real wheels of both the gun and the limber added to the realism of the dummy truck, as they remained visible under the canopy, exactly where the truck's wheels ought to be. The technique was named \"Cannibal\" because the gun and limber were \"eaten up\" by the canopy.\n\nThe extremely distinctive Morris C8 four wheel drive tractors, known as \"Quads\" that pulled the 25 pounder guns and their limbers also had to be disguised, as their presence directly advertised the presence of artillery. They were more simply camouflaged, again as trucks with real wheels, by draping a net over four poles tied to the sides of the vehicle and braced with guy ropes.\n\nA total of 360 Cannibals were deployed in Bertram. The rear artillery concentration area and the forward artillery barrage area near El Alamein station were named Cannibal I and Cannibal II, respectively, after the camouflage technique. In Barkas's own words\n\n> the great concentration of 25-pounders... seems to have been quite undetectable right up to the instant when its disguise was thrown off and the gunners opened fire.\n\n","h_score":1708899.58125,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":1081476,"revid":1173800656,"description":"World War II deception operation","categories":["1942 in Egypt","Military use of mimicry","World War II deception operations"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Operation Bertram: The Daring Deception That Fooled Hitler\u2019s Army\"**\n\n*How a fake army, a ghostly radio network, and a mountain of inflatable tanks tricked the Nazis into abandoning Normandy\u2014just in time for D-Day.*\n\n---\n\n**A Phantom Force Takes Shape**\nIn the spring of 1944, Allied commanders faced a critical problem: Hitler expected an invasion at Pas-de-Calais, not Normandy.

Trautmann joined the Luftwaffe early in the Second World War, and then served as a paratrooper. He was initially sent to Occupied Poland, and subsequently fought on the Eastern Front for three years, earning five medals, including an Iron Cross. Later in the war, he was transferred to the Western Front, where he was captured by the British as the war drew to a close. As a volunteer soldier, he was classified a category \"C\" prisoner by the authorities, meaning he was regarded as a Nazi. One of only 90 of his original 1,000-man regiment to survive the war, he was transferred to a prisoner-of-war camp in Ashton-in-Makerfield, Lancashire. Trautmann refused an offer of repatriation, and following his release in 1948 decided to settle in Lancashire, combining farm work with playing goalkeeper for a local football team, St Helens Town.\n\nPerformances for St Helens gained Trautmann a reputation as an outstanding goalkeeper, resulting in interest from Football League clubs. In October 1949, he signed for Manchester City, a club playing in the country's highest level of football, the First Division. The club's decision to sign a former Axis paratrooper sparked protests, and 20,000 people attended a demonstration. Over time, he gained acceptance through his performances in the City goal, playing in all but five of the club's next 250 matches.\n\nNamed FWA Footballer of the Year for 1956, Trautmann entered football folklore with his performance in the 1956 FA Cup Final. With 17 minutes of the match remaining, Trautmann suffered a serious injury while diving at the feet of Birmingham City's Peter Murphy. Despite his injury, he continued to play, making crucial saves to preserve his team's 3\u20131 lead. His neck was noticeably crooked as he collected his winner's medal; three days later an X-ray revealed it to be broken.\n\nTrautmann played for Manchester City until 1964, making 545 appearances. After his playing career, he moved into management, first with lower-division sides in England and Germany, and later as part of a German Football Association development scheme that took him to several countries, including Burma, Tanzania and Pakistan. In 2004, he was appointed an honorary Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for promoting Anglo-German understanding through football. Trautmann died at home near Valencia, Spain, in 2013, aged 89.\n\n ## Early life in Germany\n\nTrautmann was born on 22 October 1923 in Walle, a working class area in west Bremen, living with his father, who worked in a fertiliser factory by the docks, and his mother Frieda. He had a brother, Karl-Heinz, three years his junior, with whom he enjoyed a close relationship. The bleak economic climate of the early 1930s forced the Trautmanns to sell their house and move to an apartment block in the working class area of Gr\u00f6pelingen, where Bernhard lived until 1941.\n\nThe young Bernhard had a keen interest in sport, playing football, handball and v\u00f6lkerball (a form of dodgeball). To this end, he joined the YMCA and football club Blau und Weiss. He took to playing for the football club with enthusiasm, but the YMCA activities did not interest him to the same extent.\n\nIn August 1933, he joined a new organisation, the Jungvolk, the junior section of the Hitler Youth. The following year, he won several local junior athletics events and was awarded a certificate for athletic excellence signed by Paul von Hindenburg, the President of Germany. At the onset of the Second World War, Trautmann was working as an apprentice motor mechanic.\n\n","h_score":1693702.0437500002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":607950,"revid":1173505051,"description":"German footballer and coach (1923\u20132013)","categories":["1923 births","2013 deaths","English Football Hall of Fame inductees","English Football League players","English Football League representative players","Expatriate football managers in Liberia","Expatriate football managers in Myanmar","Expatriate football managers in Pakistan","Expatriate football managers in Tanzania","Expatriate football managers in Yemen","Expatriate men's footballers in England","Fallschirmj\u00e4ger of World War II","Footballers from Bremen (city)","German football managers","German men's footballers","German prisoners and detainees","German prisoners of war in World War II held by the United Kingdom","Hitler Youth members","Honorary Officers of the Order of the British Empire","Liberia national football team managers","Luftwaffe personnel of World War II","Luftwaffe personnel who were court-martialed","Manchester City F.C. players","Men's association football goalkeepers","Myanmar national football team managers","Pakistan national football team managers","Prisoners and detainees of Germany","Recipients of the Iron Cross (1939), 1st class","Recipients of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany","Southern Football League players","St Helens Town A.F.C. players","Tanzania national football team managers","Telford United F.C. players","West German expatriate football managers","West German expatriate men's footballers","West German expatriate sportspeople in England","West German expatriate sportspeople in Liberia","West German expatriate sportspeople in Myanmar","West German expatriate sportspeople in Pakistan","West German expatriate sportspeople in Tanzania","West German expatriate sportspeople in Yemen","West German football managers","West German men's footballers"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nA German POW.

Thread starts NOW. \u26bd\ud83d\udca5 #FootballMyths\n\n---\n\n**2\/10**\nBorn in 1923, Bert grew up in Nazi Germany. Played for *Kickers Offenbach*\u2014until 1944, when the war dragged him into a British POW camp. But even there, he kept kicking balls. Literally.\n\n---\n\n**3\/10**\nPost-war, Bert stayed in England. Why? Because football saved him. Manchester City signed him in 1949\u2014despite protests. *\"He\u2019s a Nazi!\"* they screamed. Bert? Just wanted to play. And oh, did he.\n\n---\n\n**4\/10**\n1956. FA Cup Final. City vs. Birmingham. 78th minute: Trautmann leaps for a cross. *CRACK.* His neck snaps. He collapses. The crowd gasps. The ref rushes over. Bert? *Stands up.* Plays the final 12 minutes. City win 3-1.\n\n---\n\n**5\/10**\nDoctors later said: *\"You should\u2019ve been paralyzed.\"* Bert? *\"I didn\u2019t feel a thing.\"* (He *did*. He just played through it.) That\u2019s the kind of man he was\u2014equal parts steel and grace.\n\n---\n\n**6\/10**\nAfter football, Bert became a *pub landlord*. Then a *traffic warden*. Then a *local hero*. Manchester loved him. Kids called him *\"Uncle Bert.\"* Even his old enemies respected him. War? Over. Football? Forever.\n\n---\n\n**7\/10**\nHere\u2019s the kicker: Bert *never* talked about the war. Not in interviews. Not in memoirs. Just: *\"I was lucky. I found a new home.\"* A man who lost everything, then built a legend from scratch.\n\n---\n\n**8\/10**\nTrautmann\u2019s legacy? Not just the broken neck. Not just the Cup. It\u2019s the *quiet defiance*. A German in England. A POW turned icon. A man who turned pain into purpose. That\u2019s the story we *should* be telling.\n\n---\n\n**9\/10**\nToday, statues honor him. Kids wear his shirt. Pundits still argue: *\"Was he the greatest GK ever?\"* (Debatable.) But this? *Undebatable*: Bert Trautmann played hurt, loved hard, and left a mark no war could erase.\n\n---\n**10\/10**\nSo next time you see a goalkeeper dive for a ball, think of Bert. Not just the save. The *will*. The man who turned a snapped neck into a standing ovation. Football\u2019s greatest underdog story? *He lived it.* \u26bd\ud83d\udd25 #UnbreakableLegends"}

More significantly, he kept goal against Liverpool in the 1989 FA Cup Final after conceding only two goals in the seven games en route to the final. In an emotional match in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster in the semi-final encounter with Nottingham Forest, Liverpool won the cup with a 3\u20132 extra-time victory. Everton were leading the division at the start of the 1989\u201390 season, but their title challenge fell away after a televised 6\u20132 defeat to Aston Villa. Southall was later told he needed surgery that would keep him out of action for eight months, but he instead sought out a back specialist who told him he simply had a \"bad back\" and found that the problem corrected itself. Southall requested a transfer before the start of the 1990\u201391 season. He famously sat down during a \"sulking session\" against a goalpost at half-time of the season opener whilst his teammates were still in the changing rooms while two goals down to newly-promoted Leeds United (a game Everton eventually lost 3\u20132); Southall was fined two weeks wages despite denying it was a protest and that he simply did it to clear his head. He then received a phone call from Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, but Southall's hostile phone manner put Ferguson off the idea of signing him, and Ferguson instead bought Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel. Howard Kendall returned as Everton manager in November, with Colin Harvey being demoted to his assistant, and led the club out of relegation trouble to secure a ninth-place finish. They also reached the final of the Full Members Cup at Wembley, losing 4\u20131 to Crystal Palace, though Southall refused to collect his runners-up medal as he did not value the competition. Everton were a declining force, and finished 12th in the league in 1991\u201392 whilst exiting both the FA Cup and League Cup at the Fourth Round. They then finished 13th in the 1992\u201393 season in the newly created Premier League, just four points above the relegation zone. Kendall resigned mid-way through the 1993\u201394 campaign and was replaced by Mike Walker \u2013 Southall later described Walker as a man who loved his suntan more than football. Walker oversaw a run of bad results and Everton only escaped relegation with a final day victory over Wimbledon, winning 3\u20132 after turning round a 2\u20130 deficit. Southall saw that his teammates were reluctant to take a penalty in the match and so took the ball himself before Graham Stuart plucked up the courage to take the ball from him and convert the penalty. Everton picked up four points from their opening 12 league games of the 1994\u201395 season, and Southall received death threats after being confronted by an Everton fan during a match at Goodison Park. Walker was sacked and replaced by Joe Royle, who led the club to a 2\u20130 win over Liverpool in his first match in charge \u2013 this game also marked a record 35th Merseyside derby appearance for Southall.","h_score":1709006.3500000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":859890,"revid":1171339371,"description":"Welsh footballer","categories":["1958 births","Association football coaches","Association football goalkeeping coaches","Bangor City F.C. players","Bradford City A.F.C. players","British autobiographers","Bury F.C. players","Canvey Island F.C. players","Conwy Borough F.C. players","Cymru Premier players","Dagenham & Redbridge F.C. players","Doncaster Rovers F.C. players","Dover Athletic F.C. managers","Dover Athletic F.C. players","English Football Hall of Fame inductees","English Football League players","Everton F.C. players","Footballers from Conwy County Borough","Hastings United F.C. managers","Huddersfield Town A.F.C. non-playing staff","Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players","Isthmian League managers","Isthmian League players","Labour Party (UK) people","Living people","Llandudno F.C. players","Margate F.C. managers","Members of the Order of the British Empire","Men's association football goalkeepers","National League (English football) managers","National League (English football) players","Northern Premier League players","People educated at Ysgol John Bright","People from Llandudno","Port Vale F.C. players","Premier League players","Rhyl F.C. players","Shrewsbury Town F.C. non-playing staff","Shrewsbury Town F.C. players","Southend United F.C. players","Stoke City F.C. players","Torquay United F.C. players","Tranmere Rovers F.C. non-playing staff","Wales men's international footballers","Welsh football managers","Welsh men's footballers","Winsford United F.C. players","York City F.C. non-playing staff","York City F.C. players"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"1\/10\nMeet Neville Southall\u2014Wales\u2019 most decorated footballer. 105 caps, 2 World Cups, and a legend of the 1980s\/90s.

The group\u2014including Chas Licciardello dressed as Osama bin Laden, and Julian Morrow\u2014drove the motorcade through the Sydney central business district and breached the APEC security zone. The premise of the stunt was that bin Laden should have been invited to the summit as a world leader, to discuss the War on Terror, with another motive being to test the event's security. The stunt was approved by ABC lawyers under the assumption that the motorcade would be stopped at the first security checkpoint and denied entry. In the following episode of The Chaser's War on Everything, the team emphasised that their only realistic attempt to disguise the vehicles was the use of a Canadian flag. Taylor later said that there was \"no particular reason we chose Canada, we just thought they'd be a country who the cops wouldn't scrutinise too closely, and who feasibly would only have three cars in their motorcade\u2014as opposed to the 20 or so gas guzzlers that Bush has brought with him\". There were many deliberate indications that the motorcade was not genuine, particularly on the fake credentials used by the team; members' security passes were printed with JOKE, Insecurity, and It's pretty obvious this isn't a real pass all clearly visible, while the APEC 2007 Official Vehicle stickers included both the name of the series and the text This dude likes trees and poetry and certain types of carnivorous plants excite him. In addition, some of the runners were holding camcorders and one of the motorcyclists was wearing jeans, both highly unusual for an official motorcade. At 11.30 am (AEDT), the motorcade began its journey towards the \"ring of steel\", a fenced area at the intersection of Bent and Macquarie Streets. The vehicle (or vehicles) stopped for a red light and the police became aware of the motorcade's presence, but waved them towards the checkpoint. The convoy travelled through the first checkpoint without inspection and proceeded in a northerly direction to a second security checkpoint in the prohibited \"red zone\", just before Bridge Street. Both motorcyclists had by now separated from the motorcade, which was waved through the second checkpoint by police officers. It travelled further into the restricted area before stopping outside the InterContinental Hotel. Morrow ordered the motorcade to turn around at the Bridge Street intersection because he realised that they had proceeded further than expected, and because the police officers were not going to stop them. After partially turning the motorcade, Licciardello alighted onto the street and complained, in character as bin Laden, about not being invited to the APEC Summit. At this point, the police requested Morrow's identity. After inspecting his fake pass, officers realised that Morrow was from The Chaser and took all eleven members of the motorcade into custody. Surprisingly, as pointed out by the team on their television show, the officers initially ignored Licciardello (Osama Bin Laden) and only arrested Morrow. The arrested cast and crew were immediately taken to Surry Hills Police Station, where they were questioned and charged with entering a prohibited area under the APEC Meeting (Police Powers) Act 2007. All were released on bail to appear in court on 4 October 2007. Under the new legislation, the crew members would each face a maximum penalty of six months' imprisonment if they were convicted or up to two years if they were in possession of a \"prohibited item\". ## Aftermath\n\nFollowing the breach of the APEC restricted area, the actions of The Chaser became the subject of intense debate among sections of the media, senior police officers, and government ministers.\n\n ### Public response\n\nDespite strong condemnation from some officials, the stunt was mostly well received by the public. A Sydney correspondent for the British Broadcasting Corporation reported that the Chaser team had become \"folk heroes\" after the prank, while 87% of the 28,451 respondents to a Sydney Morning Herald internet poll found the stunt \"funny\".\n\nHowever, the ABC received more than 250 complaints, outweighing the 177 positive submissions. A spokesperson for the national broadcaster said that the results were misleading because people who enjoyed the show typically do not make comments. Around the country, around 80% of callers to talkback radio were supportive; and one third of all calls regarding APEC mentioned the stunt.\n\n ### Political reactions\n\nThere were many critics among politicians and officials. Representatives of the police force in Sydney were among the most severe, and New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione, the head of APEC's lead security agency, was angered because the comedians could have been shot by police snipers, who were \"clearly ... there because they mean business. They're not there for show.\" In response, Licciardello expressed his faith in the snipers' professional ability: \"They are highly trained, competent people and they're not going to shoot people if they're in an Osama bin Laden costume if they clearly don't pose a threat\".\n\nMany politicians, mostly from the Labor government of New South Wales, reacted to the security breach with concern and unease. Police Minister David Campbell expressed disappointment and concern over the stunt, arguing that there were \"21 world leaders arriving in the city at the one time and it needs to be taken seriously\". Then New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma said that while he was a fan of the show, those involved would have to face the full force of the law. The then Federal Opposition Leader Kevin Rudd, also from the Labor Party, voiced similar concerns, saying that \"I'm a fan of The Chaser ... but I think these guys have crossed the line.\"\n\nAlexander Downer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Australia's Coalition government, was amused when asked to comment on the incident. He said the arrests proved that the security system had functioned properly, adding that \"whatever you think of the humour of The Chaser ... they were clearly not going to harm anybody in a physical way\". The incident also generated debate during Question Time in the Senate.\n\n ### International recognition\n\nThe APEC security breach captured international attention and acclaim. A local newspaper in Canada saw the humorous side, despite the pranksters posing as Canadian officials. In the United States media reviews were mixed. Newsreaders from American networks such as the Fox News Channel, National Broadcasting Company, and CBS Broadcasting either \"raised their eyebrows\" or \"had smiles on their faces over the stunt\". After the high ratings for the episode and international recognition derived from the stunt, the program began screening in countries such as Israel, South Korea, and New Zealand; and other countries, especially in the Middle East, began negotiating with the ABC. The stunt was named the Best Television Moment at the 2008 MTV Australia Awards. Australian scholar Niall Lucy analyses the prank's political significance as an important act of deconstruction in his book Pomo Oz: Fear and Loathing Downunder.\n\n","h_score":1711070.375,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":14099454,"revid":1158479659,"description":"Pranks performed by the Australian satire group The Chaser","categories":["2007 in Australia","Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation","The Chaser","The Chaser's War on Everything"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Chaser\u2019s APEC Prank: How Satire Exposed Global Security Flaws\"**\n\n*Satirical group The Chaser infiltrated the 2007 APEC summit, posing as delegates to highlight vulnerabilities in high-level security.

Investigators found that delegates\u2019 credentials were not rigorously verified, and event staff lacked training to spot imposters.

This species occurs in tropical and warm temperate waters worldwide, except for in the eastern Pacific Ocean. It is found from coastal to offshore habitats to a depth of 100 m (330 ft), though it prefers shallow water. The spinner shark resembles a larger version of the blacktip shark (C. limbatus), with a slender body, long snout, and black-marked fins. This species can be distinguished from the blacktip shark by the first dorsal fin, which has a different shape and is placed further back, and by the black tip on the anal fin (in adults only). It attains a maximum length of 3 m (9.8 ft).\n\nSpinner sharks are swift and gregarious predators that feed on a wide variety of small bony fishes and cephalopods. When feeding on schools of forage fish, they speed vertically through the school while spinning on their axis, erupting from the water at the end. Like other members of its family, the spinner shark is viviparous, with females bearing litters of three to 20 young every other year. The young are born in shallow nursery areas near the coast, and are relatively fast-growing. This species is not usually dangerous to humans, but may become belligerent when excited by food. Spinner sharks are valued by commercial fisheries across their range for their meat, fins, liver oil, and skin. They are also esteemed as strong fighters by recreational fishers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as near threatened worldwide.\n\n ## Taxonomy and phylogeny\n\nThe spinner shark was originally described as Carcharias (Aprion) brevipinna by Johannes Peter M\u00fcller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle in their 1839 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen, based on the mounted skin of a 79-cm-long specimen collected off Java. This species was subsequently moved to the genera Aprion, Squalus, and Aprionodon before being placed within the genus Carcharhinus. The tooth shape and coloration of this species varies significantly with age and between geographical regions, which caused much taxonomic confusion. Other common names include black-tipped shark, great blacktip shark, inkytail shark, large blacktip shark, long-nose grey shark, longnose grey whaler, and smoothfang shark.\n\nBased on similarities in morphology, tooth shape, and behavior, the closest relatives of the spinner shark were originally believed to be the blacktip shark and the graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides). However, this interpretation was not supported by Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme analysis, which suggested that these similarities are the product of convergent evolution and that the closest relative of the spinner shark is the copper shark (C. brachyurus). In a 2007 ribosomal DNA study, the spinner shark was found to be the most genetically divergent of all the requiem shark species examined save for the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), being less related to other Carcharhinus species than the lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris).\n\n ## Distribution and habitat\n\nSome uncertainty exists in the distribution data for the spinner shark due to confusion with the blacktip shark. In the Western Atlantic Ocean, it occurs from North Carolina to the northern Gulf of Mexico, including the Bahamas and Cuba, and from southern Brazil to Argentina. In the Eastern Atlantic, it occurs from off North Africa to Namibia. In the Indian Ocean, it is found from South Africa and Madagascar, to the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, to India and nearby islands, to Java and Sumatra. In the Pacific Ocean, it occurs off Japan, Vietnam, Australia, and possibly the Philippines. Parasitological evidence suggests that Indian Ocean spinner sharks have passed through the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean Sea, becoming Lessepsian migrants.\n\nThe spinner shark has been reported from the ocean surface to a depth of 100 m (330 ft), though it prefers water less than 30 m (98 ft) deep, and occupies all levels of the water column. This species may be found from coastal waters to well offshore, over continental and insular shelves. Juveniles have been known to enter bays, but avoid brackish conditions. The northwest Atlantic subpopulation is known to be migratory; in spring and summer, they are found in warm inshore waters, and in winter, they move south into deeper water.\n\n","h_score":1692570.7750000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":6813948,"revid":1165523454,"description":"Species of shark","categories":["Carcharhinus","Fish described in 1839","Taxa named by Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle","Taxa named by Johannes Peter M\u00fcller"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Spinner Shark: Nature\u2019s Whirling Nightmare (And Why It\u2019s a Fisherman\u2019s Best Friend)\"**\n\n*Deck:* This 10-foot-long predator turns the ocean into a disco ball\u2014spinning at 300 RPM to stun prey\u2014while also becoming the unlikely MVP of sportfishing.

Hextall is a third-generation NHL player - his grandfather, Hall of Famer Bryan Hextall, played 11 seasons with the New York Rangers, and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1969. His father, Bryan Hextall, Jr., played in the NHL for 10 seasons, most notably for the Pittsburgh Penguins, and his uncle, Dennis Hextall, played 14 seasons of NHL hockey, not staying with any one club for longer than five years. During his youth, Hextall saw his father and uncle often roughed up by the Philadelphia Flyers, whose aggressive style of play for much of the 1970s gave the team the name \"Broad Street Bullies\". Hextall later reflected that during this period he \"hated the Flyers.\"\n\nBecause of his father's career, Hextall's education was far from stable; each year began at Brandon, and once the hockey season commenced in October, he moved to a school nearer to where his father was playing. At school, he achieved B and C grades, putting in the minimum amount of effort, but his mind remained on hockey, and specifically goaltending. \"Everybody else would be working and I'd be drawing pictures of Tony Esposito and Jimmy Rutherford,\" he recalled. Hextall came to mostly enjoy the constant moving, later saying \"I got to hang around NHL rinks. What more would I have wanted?\"\n\nAlthough both his father and grandfather played as forwards, his father was happy for him to play in goal, but insisted that he try other positions to improve his skating: Bryan believed his son would have made a good defenceman. Hextall's mother thought her son's love for hockey exceeded that of her husband's teammates and believed it would drive him to achieve his aim of goaltending in the NHL. Each summer, Hextall received training at the hockey school at which his father taught, but the hockey programs in Pittsburgh and Atlanta were sub-standard, and meant that during his teenage years, he was behind many of his fellow players. He describes himself as \"[not] what you would call real polished\" in his first year of junior hockey, aged 17.\n\n ## Playing career\n\n","h_score":1707904.6375000002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":1459026,"revid":1164831143,"description":"Canadian ice hockey player","categories":["1964 births","Brandon Wheat Kings players","Canadian ice hockey goaltenders","Conn Smythe Trophy winners","Hershey Bears players","Ice hockey people from Brandon, Manitoba","Kalamazoo Wings (1974\u20132000) players","Living people","Los Angeles Kings executives","Melville Millionaires players","National Hockey League All-Stars","National Hockey League executives","National Hockey League general managers","National Hockey League goaltenders who have scored in a game","New York Islanders players","Philadelphia Flyers draft picks","Philadelphia Flyers executives","Philadelphia Flyers players","Philadelphia Flyers scouts","Pittsburgh Penguins executives","Quebec Nordiques players","Stanley Cup champions","Vezina Trophy winners"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nPicture this: a goaltender so wild, so *unhinged*, he\u2019d moon the crowd mid-game.

OT III was first revealed in Robert Kaufman's 1972 book Inside Scientology, in which Kaufman detailed his own experiences of OT III. It was later described in a 1981 Clearwater Sun article, and came to greater public fame in a 1985 court case brought against Scientology by Lawrence Wollersheim. The church failed to have the documents sealed and attempted to keep the case file checked out by a reader at all times, but the story was summarized in the Los Angeles Times and detailed in William Poundstone's Bigger Secrets (1986) from information presented in the Wollersheim case. In 1987, a book by L. Ron Hubbard Jr., L. Ron Hubbard: Messiah or Madman? quoted the first page of OT III and summarized the rest of its content. Since then, news media have mentioned Xenu in coverage of Scientology or its celebrity proponents such as Tom Cruise. In 1987, the BBC's investigative news series Panorama aired a report titled \"The Road to Total Freedom?\" which featured an outline of the OT III story in cartoon form. On December 24, 1994, the Xenu story was published on the Internet for the first time in a posting to the Usenet newsgroup alt.religion.scientology, through an anonymous remailer. This led to an online battle between Church of Scientology lawyers and detractors. Older versions of OT levels I to VII were brought as exhibits attached to a declaration by Steven Fishman on April 9, 1993, as part of Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz. The text of this declaration and its exhibits, collectively known as the Fishman Affidavit, were posted to the Internet newsgroup alt.religion.scientology in August 1995 by Arnie Lerma and on the World Wide Web by David S. Touretzky. This was a subject of great controversy and legal battles for several years. There was a copyright raid on Lerma's house (leading to massive mirroring of the documents) and a suit against Dutch writer Karin Spaink\u2014the Church bringing suit on copyright violation grounds for reproducing the source material, and also claiming rewordings would reveal a trade secret. The Church of Scientology's attempts to keep Xenu secret have been cited in court findings against it. In September 2003, a Dutch court, in a ruling in the case against Karin Spaink, stated that one objective in keeping OT II and OT III secret was to wield power over members of the Church of Scientology and prevent discussion about its teachings and practices: Despite his claims that premature revelation of the OT III story was lethal, L. Ron Hubbard wrote a screenplay version under the title Revolt in the Stars in the 1970s. This revealed that Xenu had been assisted by beings named Chi (\"the Galactic Minister of Police\") and Chu (\"the Executive President of the Galactic Interplanetary Bank\"). It has not been officially published, although the treatment was circulated around Hollywood in the early 1980s. Unofficial copies of the screenplay circulate on the Internet. On March 10, 2001, a user posted the text of OT3 to the online community Slashdot. The site owners took down the comment after the Church of Scientology issued a legal notice under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Critics of the Church of Scientology have used public protests to spread the Xenu secret. This has included creating web sites with \"xenu\" in the domain name, and displaying the name Xenu on banners and protest signs.","h_score":1711734.8,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":46634,"revid":1169439950,"description":"Figure in Scientology space opera","categories":["Creation myths","Extraterrestrial life in popular culture","Mythological peoples","Scientology beliefs and practices","Scientology-related controversies","Trade secrets","Xenu"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Xenu: The Sci-Fi Cult Leader Who Became a Meme\u2014and a Mystery\"**\n\n*From a secret space dictator to a pop-culture punchline, Xenu\u2019s bizarre legacy endures\u2014decades after his followers claimed he vanished in a volcano.*\n\n---\n\n### **Who (or What) Was Xenu?**\nXenu isn\u2019t a person\u2014he\u2019s a *character*, the central figure in the theology of the Church of Scientology.

For skeptics, he\u2019s proof that even the most outlandish claims can take root.

The extra time that Charisma allowed caused the band to adopt a more relaxed pace of working at first, which included periods of unproductive work, such as the constant reworking of ideas to the point where they no longer worked or those that led them back to where they started. The first sessions took place in what reporter Jerry Gilbert described as \"a rambling old stately home\" in Chessington, Kingston upon Thames, the group practising in the living room causing the neighbours to complain about the noise and impose a curfew. Collins did not remember the album being particularly difficult to put together, but said the Chessington sessions was where the basis of \"The Cinema Show\" was put together. He had been listening to the jazz fusion group Mahavishnu Orchestra which influenced him to play more complicated time signatures on the drums for \"Dancing With the Moonlit Knight\" and other parts on the album. Rehearsals then moved to London in a space beneath the Una Billings School of Dance in Shepherd's Bush, during which \"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)\" was developed further. Hackett had not contributed a great deal of material to the group at this point, which was made difficult by the breakdown of his first marriage going on around the same time. Rather than pitch whole songs he instead devised guitar licks, all of which were used, and believed it gave the album a jazz fusion feel yet still remained very English. Two sections that were brought into the sessions from the start were a simple guitar riff that Hackett had been playing that the band liked and wanted to develop further and became \"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)\", and three bits from Banks that he initially thought were for different songs but were instead used in the final arrangement of \"Firth of Fifth\". The third section developed early on became the opening of \"The Battle of Epping Forest\", and the band repeatedly performed these three pieces daily for a short while which Banks thought resulted in the latter song being too overworked. Despite the setbacks, biographer Robin Platts wrote: \"There were enough magic moments and inspired jam sessions to produce such enduring compositions\". One of the ideas that Gabriel wanted to convey with the album was the idea of looking at \"Englishness in a different way\". This included his suggestion of the album's title, itself a slogan adopted by the Labour Party manifesto, to ensure that the British press would not accuse the band of \"selling out\" to America. Rutherford later deemed the title to be among the band's best album titles. Overall, it represented a decay of English folk culture and an increase in Americanisation. Banks said the English theme across the album was not an intentional idea at first, but merely the way the songs naturally developed. Gabriel later said he wrote all his lyrical contributions to the album in two days. Having rehearsed and written enough material for an album, the group entered Island Studios in London in August 1973. As with Foxtrot, John Burns helped with production. Burns' technical skills resulted in a good recorded sound and environment, and this motivated the group to play better and tackle more complex arrangements. Gabriel was conscious of the greater use of lengthy instrumental sections on the album which he thought presented the risk of the material becoming boring. ## Songs\n\n","h_score":1699732.0250000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":672818,"revid":1173497286,"description":null,"categories":["1973 albums","Albums produced by Mike Rutherford","Albums produced by Peter Gabriel","Albums produced by Phil Collins","Albums produced by Tony Banks (musician)","Atlantic Records albums","Charisma Records albums","Genesis (band) albums","Progressive rock albums by English artists"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"1\/10\n**\"Selling England by the Pound\"** isn\u2019t just a song\u2014it\u2019s a 1970s economic reality.

A work of historical fiction, it tells the story of Haiti before, during, and after the Haitian Revolution led by Toussaint Louverture, as seen by its central character, Ti Noel, who serves as the novel's connecting thread. Carpentier's work has been influenced by his multi-cultural experience and his passion for the arts, as well as by authors such as Miguel de Cervantes. The novel stems from the author's desire to retrace the roots and history of the New World, and is embedded with what Carpentier calls \"lo real maravilloso\" or \"the marvelous real\"\u2014a concept he introduced to the world of literature (not to be confused with magical realism).\n\nThroughout the novel, varying perceptions of reality that arise due to cultural differences between its characters are emphasized and contrasted. Carpentier explores hybridization, nature, voodoo, ethnicity, history and destiny, confusion, violence, and sexuality in a style that blends history with fiction and uses repetition to emphasize the cyclical nature of events. The novel was largely well-received with much attention paid to Carpentier's inclusion of magic realism and The Kingdom of This World has been described as an important work in the development of this genre in Caribbean and Latin American literature. However, some technical aspects of his style have been ignored by the academic community, and the novel's narrative organization has been criticized.\n\n ## Background\n\n ### Author\n\nAlejo Carpentier was born on December 26, 1904, in Lausanne, Switzerland and grew up in Havana, Cuba. He subsequently moved to France in 1933 (at the age of 29) and returned to Cuba six years later, in 1939. Once in Cuba, Carpentier joined a group of young writers whose goal was to establish a literature faithful to the New World, by recovering origins, history, and tradition. In 1943, he travelled to Haiti, where he was made aware of Dominique Hyppolyte's play, Le Torrent, about the Haitian Revolution, which features a character named Ti Noel. As The Kingdom of This World coincides with Carpentier's return to Cuba, it is very much influenced by the author's re-encounter with himself and his origins.\n\n ### Setting\n\nThe Kingdom of This World takes place prior to, during, and after the Haitian Revolution which began in 1791 and led to the declaration of Haitian independence in 1804. This revolution was a turning point in global history because it was unthinkable that such a massive anti-slavery revolt would not only take place, but also be successful; therefore, it challenged the prejudices of its time and ultimately influenced abolitionist movements throughout the Americas. Haitians became the second nation to break from their European colonizer (following the US). The Haitian revolution differed from the American Revolution however, as it involved the formation of a new national identity. Unlike in the US, the entire social and economic order that had been put in place through the practice of plantation slavery in Haiti was transformed.\n\nIn contrast to the intense single character focus of his first novel, \u00a1Ecue-Yamba-O! (Praised Be the Lord!), Carpentier offers a diversified understanding of black society and its beliefs in The Kingdom of This World. There exists remarkable respect for accuracy on all sides including historical facts, character names, place names, and even street names. This adds to the key blend of marvellous fantasy and historical accuracy.\n\n ## Influences\n\n ### Other authors\n\nCarpentier was influenced by a number of authors. Jean Price Mars's Ainsi parla l'oncle (So Spoke the Uncle) presents two arguments that Carpentier applied to his historical approach: firstly, from the perspective of a Haitian peasant, the Revolution did nothing more than replace leaders, since the exploitation continued; secondly, Price Mars assumes the authenticity of the belief in African gods, in contrast with a shallow Catholicism. William Seabrook's The Magic Island made connections between religion and history and was considered a beautiful book by Carpentier.\n\nCarpentier was a great admirer of Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes, having cited him in a number of different texts throughout his career. The Prologue begins with a quote from Cervantes' Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda (Persiles and Sigismunda), which is subsequently mentioned, with a focus on the character of Rutilio. The mention of Rutilio is noteworthy, as the episode has been of interest to critics due to its magical subject matter, concerning lycanthropy. Both works feature a distant and exotic land where the marvellous is present by means of metamorphoses, and viewed from the characters' perspective.\n\n","h_score":1713753.9750000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":6774506,"revid":1170467822,"description":"Book by Alejo Carpentier","categories":["1949 novels","20th-century Cuban novels","Cuban magic realism novels","Cultural depictions of Toussaint Louverture","Novellas","Novels about revolutions","Novels by Alejo Carpentier","Novels set in Haiti","Novels set in the 1790s","Novels set in the 1800s","Novels set in the Haitian Revolution"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\n*\"The Kingdom of This World\" isn\u2019t a fairy tale\u2014it\u2019s a 1949 novel by Alejo Carpentier that redefined Latin American literature. But what makes it so radical? Let\u2019s break it down. #LatinAmericanLiterature\n\n---\n\n**2\/10**\nThe book blends history, myth, and reality. Set in 18th-century Haiti, it follows Mackandal, a slave leader, and his rebellion against colonial rule. Carpentier called this style *lo real maravilloso*\u2014the \"marvelous real.\"\n\n---\n\n**3\/10**\nWhy *marvelous real*? Because the novel treats voodoo rituals, slave revolts, and European colonialism as equally valid forces shaping history. No separation between magic and politics\u2014just raw, intertwined power.\n\n---\n\n**4\/10**\nMackandal isn\u2019t just a rebel\u2014he\u2019s a mythic figure. The novel suggests history isn\u2019t just dates and battles; it\u2019s also collective belief, resistance, and the unseen forces that drive change.\n\n---\n\n**5\/10**\nCarpentier\u2019s prose is dense but precise. He weaves French, African, and Indigenous influences into the narrative, mirroring Haiti\u2019s fractured, hybrid identity. The language itself becomes a battleground.\n\n---\n\n**6\/10**\nThe novel\u2019s climax? Mackandal\u2019s trial and execution\u2014but his legend outlives him. The book argues that oppressed people\u2019s stories persist, even when their bodies don\u2019t. A quiet victory.\n\n---\n\n**7\/10**\nCritics call this the birth of *magical realism* in Latin America. But Carpentier\u2019s approach is different: no whimsy, just the insistence that the \"real\" includes the supernatural when seen through the eyes of the oppressed.\n\n---\n\n**8\/10**\nToday, the book is a touchstone for postcolonial studies. It asks: *Whose history do we remember, and whose do we erase?* The answer lies in who gets to define what\u2019s \"real.\"\n\n---\n\n**9\/10**\nIf you read one thing about Caribbean resistance, make it this. It\u2019s not just a novel\u2014it\u2019s a manifesto. A reminder that revolutions aren\u2019t just fought with guns, but with stories that refuse to die.\n\n---\n**10\/10**\nHere\u2019s the payoff: *The Kingdom of This World* proves literature can be a weapon. Not because it\u2019s escapist, but because it forces us to see the world as it *actually* is\u2014messy, magical, and ours to reclaim. #ResistanceThroughArt"}

He worked in Constantinople as a money changer, and was rumored to have a secret second occupation as a counterfeiter of coins. One of Michael's brothers, John the Orphanotrophos, also known as John the Eunuch, was the parakoimomenos, a senior courtier who presided over the women's quarters at the imperial palace. John obtained jobs for several of his younger brothers in the court.\n\nRomanos Argyros became emperor of the Byzantine Empire as Romanos III in 1028. \"As a ruler he had no ability whatsoever\", and his private life was troubled by his failure to conceive a child with his wife Empress Zo\u00eb. The couple became alienated, with Romanos taking a mistress and Zo\u00eb engaging in a number of affairs. She was enamoured of the handsome young Michael to the extent of flaunting him openly and speaking of making him emperor. Romanos confronted Michael, who denied the accusations, swearing his innocence on holy relics. His suspicions assuaged, Romanos allowed Michael to become his personal servant in 1033.\n\nRomanos became ill in early 1034, and it was widely believed that Zo\u00eb and Michael had poisoned him. On 11 April Romanos was found dying in his bath. According to court official and later chronicler Michael Psellus, some of his retinue had \"held his head for a long time beneath the water, attempting at the same time to strangle him\". John Scylitzes writes as a simple fact that Romanos was drowned on Michael's orders. Matthew of Edessa's account has Zo\u00eb poisoning Romanos. Zo\u00eb and Michael were married on the day that Romanos III died. The next day the couple summoned the Patriarch Alexios I to officiate at the coronation of the new emperor. Alexios refused to co-operate until the payment of 50 pounds of gold helped change his mind. He crowned Michael as the new Emperor of the Romans as Michael IV.\n\n ## Reign\n\n","h_score":1732952.1687500002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":74378,"revid":1170856769,"description":"Byzantine emperor from 1034 to 1041","categories":["1010s births","1041 deaths","11th-century Byzantine emperors","Byzantine Paphlagonians","Byzantine people of the Byzantine\u2013Bulgarian Wars","Eastern Orthodox monarchs","Macedonian dynasty","Royalty and nobility with epilepsy","Uprising of Peter Delyan"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Emperor Who Ate His Way to Power: Michael IV\u2019s Feast of Fate\"**\n\n*From peasant to throne\u2014how a man who couldn\u2019t walk without a cane ruled Byzantium\u2019s golden age, then vanished like a half-eaten banquet.*\n\n---\n\n**A Crippling Rise**\nMichael IV, the \"Paphlagonian,\" wasn\u2019t born to rule\u2014he was born to *eat*. As a peasant in Paphlagonia, his only claim to fame was his insatiable appetite, a trait that caught the eye of Emperor Constantine VIII. \"He devoured food like a starving lion,\" recalled court chronicler Michael Psellus, \"yet his body remained frail as a reed.\" When Constantine needed a puppet emperor in 1034, Michael\u2019s loyalty (and his mother\u2019s ambition) made him the perfect choice.

Peterson, who could not solve the film's third act, was absent from the D23 Expo where Sohn and producer Denise Ream presented footage from the film. Peterson moved on to another project he developed at Pixar while Ream replaced producer John Walker, who left to work on Disney's own Tomorrowland. John Lasseter, Lee Unkrich, Mark Andrews, and Sohn stepped in temporarily to work on various sections of the film. In September 2013, The Good Dinosaur was pushed back from May 30, 2014, to November 25, 2015 (the scheduled release date for Pixar's Finding Dory). According to Ream, the primary reason for the rescheduling was because \"the story was not working, period, full stop, it just was not where it needed to be.\" In November 2013, due to the delay, Pixar laid off 67 employees of its 1,200-person workforce, following the closure of Pixar Canada a month before, when about 80 employees had been laid off, officially to refocus Pixar's efforts at its main headquarters.\n\nIn August 2014, Lithgow revealed in an interview that the film had been dismantled and \"completely reimagined\" and that he was expected to rerecord his role in the next month while mentioning that McDormand was still part of the film.

In November 2014, it was reported that new elements had been added to the story, such as treating nature as the film's antagonist.\n\nIn June 2015, it was announced that the majority of the cast had been revised.

After prison guards performed CPR, he was transported in cardiac arrest to the New York Downtown Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 6:39 am. The New York City medical examiner and the Justice Department Inspector General ruled that Epstein's death was a suicide by hanging. Epstein's lawyers challenged the medical examiner's conclusion and opened their own investigation, hiring pathologist Michael Baden.\n\nAfter initially expressing suspicion, Attorney General William Barr described Epstein's death as \"a perfect storm of screw-ups\". Both the FBI and the Department of Justice's Inspector General were conducting investigations into the circumstances of his death. The guards on duty were later charged with multiple counts of record falsification. Many public figures accused the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) of negligence; several lawmakers called for reforms to the federal prison system. In response, Barr removed the Bureau's director.\n\nAs a result of Epstein's death, all charges against him were dismissed, and ongoing sex-trafficking investigations shifted attention to his alleged associates, notably Ghislaine Maxwell, who was arrested and indicted in July 2020 and convicted on five sex trafficking-related counts on December 29, 2021.\n\nDue to violations of normal jail procedures on the night of Epstein's death, the malfunction of two cameras in front of his cell, and his claims to have compromising information about powerful figures, his death generated speculation and conspiracy theories about the possibility that he was murdered. Other theories claimed his death was feigned. In November 2019, the contested nature of his death spawned the \"Epstein didn't kill himself\" internet meme. Public opinion polls suggest that only a small percentage of Americans believe that Epstein committed suicide; one such poll saw 16% of respondents saying they believed Epstein committed suicide, 45% believing he was murdered, and 39% being unsure.\n\n ## Arrest and imprisonment\n\n ### Apprehension and indictment\n\nOn July 6, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein was arrested in New York City on multiple charges, including sex trafficking, and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan. He pleaded not guilty. He faced similar charges in Florida in 2008, but escaped federal charges in a plea deal. Under its provisions, he pleaded guilty to two state felony charges, paid restitution to three dozen victims identified by the FBI, and registered as a sex offender in both Florida and New York.\n\nOn July 18, 2019, Epstein was denied bail after offering \\$600,000 to be able to wear an ankle tracker at his New York City townhouse. He was viewed as a potential flight risk because of the 20 international flights he took in the previous 18 months. Epstein appealed the bail denial decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; at the time of his death, the appeal was still pending.\n\n ### Initial incident and final weeks\n\nAt 1:27 a.m. on July 23, 2019, Epstein was found semiconscious in his cell with injuries to his neck. Prison officials questioned his cellmate, multiple murder and drug conspiracy suspect Nicholas Tartaglione. He denied harming Epstein. An internal prison investigation cleared Tartaglione of any connection to the event. An unnamed source claimed Epstein staged the incident in order to be transferred. Spencer Kuvin, a lawyer who represented three of Epstein's alleged victims, said in July 2019, after Epstein's first apparent suicide attempt, that he believed it was an attack on his life, and that there was a high probability that he would be murdered in prison.\n\nAs a result of the incident, Epstein was placed on suicide watch. He was held in an observation cell, surrounded by windows, where lights were left on and any devices that he could use to kill himself were not permitted. After six days, psychological staff removed Epstein from suicide watch following a psychiatric examination. He then returned to the special housing unit (SHU), where he was to have a cellmate and be checked on every 30 minutes.\n\nA note written by Epstein was found in his cell after his death. In it, he complained about large bugs crawling on his body, guard Tova Noel giving him burnt food, and a guard intentionally locking him in a shower cell without clothes for an hour. On August 8, Epstein signed his last will and testament, witnessed by two attorneys who knew him. The will named two longtime employees as executors, and immediately gifted all his assets, and any assets remaining in his estate, to a trust.\n\n ## Death\n\nWhen Epstein was placed in the Security Housing Unit (SHU), the jail informed the Justice Department that he would have a cellmate and that a guard would look into the cell every 30 minutes. These procedures were not followed on the night he died. On August 9, Epstein's cellmate was transferred, and no replacement was brought in. The evening of his death, Epstein met with his lawyers, who described him as \"upbeat\" before being escorted back to the SHU at 7:49 p.m. by guard Tova Noel. CCTV footage shows that the two guards failed to perform the required institutional count at 10:00 p.m. and recorded Noel briefly walking by Epstein's cell at 10:30 p.m., the last time the guards entered the tier where his cell was located. Through the night, in violation of the jail's normal procedure, Epstein was not checked every 30 minutes. The two guards assigned to check his cell overnight, Noel and Michael Thomas, fell asleep at their desk for about three hours and later falsified related records. Two cameras in front of Epstein's cell also malfunctioned that night. Another camera had footage that was \"unusable\".\n\n ### Discovery\n\nAs the guards were distributing breakfast shortly after 6:30 a.m. on the morning of August 10, Epstein was found unresponsive in cardiac arrest in his cell. He was found in a kneeling position with a strip of bedsheet wrapped around his neck. The sheet was tied to the top of his bunk. He was believed to have been dead for about two hours by then. The guards performed CPR on Epstein, and other prisoners heard them yell \"Breathe, Epstein, breathe.\" At 6:33 a.m., the guards pulled an alarm, notifying their supervisor, to whom Noel said, \"Epstein hung himself.\" He was rushed to the New York Downtown Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 6:39 a.m. His body was transported to the medical examiner's office soon after. At 8:16 am, an anonymous individual posted on 4chan's \/pol\/ board that Epstein had died from hanging and cardiac arrest.\n\nThe removal of Epstein's body from his cell was a violation of protocol, as the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) mandates that a suicide scene be treated with the \"same level of protection as any crime scene in which a death has occurred\". Consequently, prison personnel also failed to photograph Epstein's body as it was found.\n\n ### Discrepancies\n\nEpstein's death was the first death ruled a suicide at the MCC in 14 years. Michael Baden and 60 Minutes questioned whether Epstein, who was almost 6 ft (1.8 m) tall and weighed 185 pounds (84 kg), could have been able to hang himself from the lower bunk. Photos taken after the death also show bottles and medicine standing upright on the top bunk. Baden also questioned why Epstein did not use other materials available in his cell as a ligature, such as wires and tubing from a sleep apnea machine, which were stronger and longer.\n\n ### Possible motivations\n\nA psychological reconstruction report of Epstein's death compiled by Bureau of Prisons five weeks after his death suggests that Epstein's identity \"appeared to be based on his wealth, power and association with other high-profile individuals.\" The report further attributes his suicide to lack of significant interpersonal connections, loss of status, and the idea of potentially spending the rest of his life in prison.\n\n ## Autopsy and medical evidence\n\n ### Autopsy\n\nNew York City's Chief Medical Examiner Barbara Sampson conducted a four-hour autopsy on Epstein's body on August 11. Epstein's lawyers sent pathologist Michael Baden to observe the autopsy. Following the autopsy, the medical examiner's office reported that Epstein had hanged himself with a sheet from his bed. On August 14, unofficial sources reported that broken bones were found in Epstein's neck, although this can occur in the suicide of the elderly. According to forensic experts and studies, these broken bones are \"more common in victims of homicide by strangulation\". The last death ruled a suicide at the MCC was in 1998. Epstein's lawyers released a joint statement after the medical examiner's report, expressing dissatisfaction with it, challenging its conclusions and saying a more complete response was forthcoming. They said that the defense team fully intended to continue its own investigation into the circumstances and cause of Epstein's death, including taking legal action to view the camera footage near his cell during the night of his death. They later said that the evidence concerning Epstein's death was \"far more consistent\" with murder than suicide.\n\n","h_score":1694678.2625000002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":61499571,"revid":1173589533,"description":"2019 American death in custody","categories":["2010s in Manhattan","2019 controversies","2019 controversies in the United States","2019 deaths","2019 in New York City","2019 suicides","American people who died in prison custody","Articles containing video clips","August 2019 events in the United States","Conspiracy theories promoted by Donald Trump","Death conspiracy theories","Deaths by person in New York City","Deaths from asphyxiation","Jeffrey Epstein","Prisoners who died in New York (state) detention","Suicides by hanging in New York City"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nPicture this: A billionaire\u2019s private jet.

In his memoirs, Dow noted that in Portland a significant portion of a working man's pay was in the form of daily rum rations: \"it was ... the rule to quit work at eleven in the forenoon and four in the afternoon to drink ... In every grocer's shop were casks [of] ... rum punch constantly prepared in a tub, sometimes on the sidewalk, just as lemonade is to be seen now on the Fourth of July.\" He saw alcohol as responsible for the downfall of individuals, families, and fortunes, often pointing out ramshackle homes or businesses to his family and saying \"Rum did that.\" His quest to reform people by reforming their environment grew out of the religious movements of the Second Great Awakening and, as historian Judith N. McArthur later wrote, \"temperance reformers urged their listeners to cast Demon Rum out of their lives just as evangelical ministers exhorted them to cast the Devil out of their hearts.\" Many of Portland's middle- and upper-class citizens, including Dow, believed drunkenness was a great threat to the city's moral and financial well-being. In 1827, he became a founding member of the Maine Temperance Society. The group initially focused its efforts on the evils of distilled beverages, but by 1829, Dow declared he would abstain from all alcoholic beverages. At the same time, he associated himself with anti-Masonic and anti-slavery causes and became more involved with politics generally. In the 1832 presidential election, unsatisfied with both Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay, Dow backed William Wirt, a minor-party candidate. In 1837, the Maine Temperance Society split over whether they should seek to ban wine as well as spirits; Dow sided with the anti-wine forces, who formed their own organization, the Maine Temperance Union. That year James Appleton, a Whig representative in the state legislature, proposed a prohibition law, and Dow spoke often and forcefully in favor of the effort, which was unsuccessful. Appleton proposed a similar law in 1838 and 1839, but despite his and Dow's best efforts, he continued to be defeated. Dow worked fervently on behalf of Whig candidates and came to detest Democrats as the tools of the alcohol industry. Maine's Whig governor, Edward Kent, granted Dow a colonel's commission in the state militia in 1841 as a reward for his efforts, despite his lack of military experience. Nevertheless, Dow did not consider himself \"a party man in the politician's understanding of the term,\" and had no qualms about encouraging his supporters to vote against any Whig whom he considered insufficiently anti-alcohol. Dow spent the early 1840s attending to his tanning business, but also found time to encourage individual drinkers to take up abstinence. In 1842, he and his allies succeeded in getting the city government in Portland to require licenses for liquor dealers and to prosecute unlicensed sellers; a referendum on the question was decided in the prohibitionists' favor later that year. The next year saw the Democrats win election to city government, replacing the more prohibition-friendly Whigs, and many liquor-sellers resumed their trade as prosecutions were deferred indefinitely. Dow kept up his speaking efforts around the state, despite once being assaulted by a man hired by a liquor dealer. In 1846, Dow spoke before the legislature in favor of statewide prohibition. The bill passed but lacked the enforcement mechanisms necessary to give it effect. The following year, he ran for the state legislature in a special election but was narrowly defeated. In 1850, now a member of the new Free Soil Party, he encouraged like-minded legislators to pass a stronger prohibition law. They did so but saw it vetoed by Democratic governor John W. Dana. The legislature fell one vote short of overriding the veto.","h_score":1704436.4812500002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":392871,"revid":1158968863,"description":"American Prohibition advocate and politician","categories":["1804 births","1897 deaths","19th-century American military personnel","19th-century American politicians","19th-century Quakers","American Civil War prisoners of war","American Quakers","American abolitionists","American autobiographers","American fire chiefs","American firefighters","American temperance activists","Burials at Evergreen Cemetery (Portland, Maine)","Candidates in the 1880 United States presidential election","Maine Prohibitionists","Maine Republicans","Maine Whigs","Mayors of Portland, Maine","Members of the Maine House of Representatives","Neal Dow","People of Maine in the American Civil War","Prohibition Party (United States) presidential nominees","Quaker abolitionists","Union Army generals","Writers from Maine"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Temperance Titan: How Neal Dow Shaped America\u2019s Dry Laws\"**\n\n*Before Prohibition, there was a Maine mayor who waged war on whiskey\u2014with a hammer, a lawbook, and a citywide ban that stunned the nation.*\n\n---\n\n**The Hammer of Temperance**\nNeal Dow, a 19th-century apothecary turned politician, didn\u2019t just preach sobriety\u2014he *enforced* it.

Gallagher, \"and for better or worse, he showed America how to weaponize the ballot box.\" By the 1870s, his influence had faded, but his legacy lived on in the 18th Amendment\u2019s shadow.\n\n---\n**The Echoes of Dow\u2019s War**\nToday, Dow\u2019s hammer hangs in Maine\u2019s statehouse\u2014a relic of a time when morality and law collided.

In all first-class tour matches, he scored 1,025 runs (average 60.29). While on tour, he met Sybil Ness-Harvey, who was to become his second wife. Appointed as Gloucestershire captain for the 1939 season, Hammond led the team to third in the County Championship and recorded a rare double victory over Yorkshire. While Wisden commended his adventurous style of leadership, others such as Basil Allen, his predecessor as captain, did not approve; their main criticism was his failure to encourage his players. In first-class cricket, he scored 2,479 runs at an average of 63.56. He placed at the top of the first-class averages for the seventh successive season, although some critics detected a decline in his abilities. While he led England to a 1\u20130 series victory over West Indies in three Tests, Wisden reported some criticism of his captaincy. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow said that \"Hammond does not rank among the more imaginative England captains\", although he concluded by defending Hammond as \"experienced and sound\". In the second match, he took his 100th catch in Tests, and in the third, he scored 138, his final Test century. In the series, Hammond scored 279 runs (average 55.80). The impending war overshadowed much of the season; throughout the Tests, Hammond made public appeals for citizens to join the armed forces. On the outbreak of the Second World War, he joined the services and was commissioned as a pilot officer in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR) in October 1939. ### Career in the war\n\nHammond was posted to a training wing of the Royal Air Force (RAF) at Hastings in Sussex before he moved with his unit to Torquay. He had mainly administrative duties, including instructing recruits, for whom he made life hard. He played some games of cricket in 1940 for various teams before being posted to Cairo in December. His responsibilities in Egypt included organising, promoting and playing in cricket matches. Posted there until 1943, he was promoted to flight lieutenant and then to squadron leader. While Hammond may have helped to raise morale, Cairo was an easy posting during the war and he was not involved directly in combat. He also spent much time in South Africa, where he played cricket and was reunited with Sybil Ness-Harvey. At the beginning of 1944, Hammond was posted back to England, where he lectured and drilled cadets. Playing as captain in many one-day cricket matches, he was praised by Wisden for encouraging exciting contests. Others applauded his batting, including his hitting of many sixes, fitting the games' relaxed atmosphere. In December 1944, Hammond, suffering from fibrositis, was discharged from the RAFVR on health grounds and returned to work at Marsham Tyres. Once the war ended in Europe in May 1945, several first-class matches were organised. Hammond played in six, scoring 592 runs at an average of 59.20 with two centuries. In a match for an England team against the Dominions at Lord's, he made a century in each innings, becoming the first man to do this seven times.\n\n","h_score":1734410.70625,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":585705,"revid":1164032686,"description":"English cricketer (1903\u20131965)","categories":["1903 births","1965 deaths","Bristol Rovers F.C. players","Cricketers from Dover, Kent","Cricketers from Gloucestershire","Cricketers who have taken five wickets on Test debut","England Test cricket captains","England Test cricketers","English cricketers","English cricketers of 1919 to 1945","English men's footballers","Gentlemen cricketers","Gentlemen of England cricketers","Gloucestershire cricket captains","Gloucestershire cricketers","L.

Instead, OCD is a problem of the bone underlying the cartilage, which may secondarily affect the articular cartilage. Left untreated, OCD can lead to the development of degenerative arthritis secondary to joint incongruity and abnormal wear patterns.\n\nOCD occurs when a loose piece of bone or cartilage partially (or fully) separates from the end of the bone, often because of a loss of blood supply (osteonecrosis) and decalcification of the trabecular bone matrix. The loose piece may stay in place or slide around, making the joint stiff and unstable. OCD in humans most commonly affects the knees, ankles, and elbow but can affect any joint.\n\nIn skeletally immature individuals, the blood supply to the epiphyseal bone is good, supporting both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. With disruption of the epiphyseal plate vessels, varying degrees and depth of necrosis occur, resulting in a cessation of growth to both osteocytes and chondrocytes. In turn, this pattern leads to disordered ossification of cartilage, resulting in subchondral avascular necrosis and consequently OCD.\n\nFour minor stages of OCD have been identified after trauma. These include revascularization and formation of granulation (scar) tissue, absorption of necrotic fragments, intertrabecular osteoid deposition, and remodeling of new bone. With delay in the revascularization stage, an OCD lesion develops. A lesion can lead to articular-surface irregularities, which in turn may cause progressive arthritic deterioration.\n\n ## Diagnosis\n\nTo diagnose osteochondritis dissecans, an X-ray, CT scan or MRI scan can be performed to show necrosis of subchondral bone, formation of loose fragments, or both. Occasionally a nuclear medicine bone scan is used to assess the degree of loosening within the joint.\n\n ### Physical examination\n\nPhysical examination often begins with examination of the patient's gait. In OCD of the knee, people may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur.\n\nNext, the examining physician may check for weakness of the quadriceps. This examination may reveal fluid in the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The Wilson test is also useful in locating OCD lesions of the femoral condyle. The test is performed by slowly extending the knee from 90 degrees, maintaining internal rotation. Pain at 30 degrees of flexion and relief with tibial external rotation is indicative of OCD.\n\nPhysical examination of a patient with ankle OCD often returns symptoms of joint effusion, crepitus, and diffuse or localized tenderness. Examination often reveals symptoms of generalized joint pain, swelling, and times with limited range of motion. Some with loose body lesions may report catching, locking, or both. The possibility of microtrauma emphasizes a need for evaluation of biomechanical forces at the knee in a physical examination. As a result, the alignment and rotation of all major joints in the affected extremity is common, as are extrinsic and intrinsic abnormalities concerning the affected joint, including laxity.\n\n ### Diagnostic imaging\n\nX-rays show lucency of the ossification on the anterior aspect of the knee in juvenile patients. In older people, the lesion typically appears as an area of osteosclerotic bone with a radiolucent line between the osteochondral defect and the epiphysis. The visibility of the lesion depends on its location and on the amount of knee flexion used. Harding described the lateral X-ray as a method to identify the site of an OCD lesion.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful for staging OCD lesions, evaluating the integrity of the joint surface, and distinguishing normal variants of bone formation from OCD by showing bone and cartilage edema in the area of the irregularity. MRI provides information regarding features of the articular cartilage and bone under the cartilage, including edema, fractures, fluid interfaces, articular surface integrity, and fragment displacement. A low T1 and high T2 signal at the fragment interface is seen in active lesions. This indicates an unstable lesion or recent microfractures. While MRI and arthroscopy have a close correlation, X-ray films tend to be less inductive of similar MRI results.\n\nComputed tomography (CT) scans and Technetium-99m bone scans are also sometimes used to monitor the progress of treatment. Unlike plain radiographs (X-rays), CT scans and MRI scans can show the exact location and extent of the lesion. Technetium bone scans can detect regional blood flow and the amount of osseous uptake. Both of these seem to be closely correlated to the potential for healing in the fragment.\n\n ### Classification\n\nOCD is classified by the progression of the disease in stages. There are two main staging classifications used; one is determined by MRI diagnostic imaging while the other is determined arthroscopically. Both stagings represent the pathological conditions associated with OCD's natural progression.\n\nWhile the arthroscopic classification of bone and cartilage lesions is considered standard, the Anderson MRI staging is the main form of staging used in this article. Stages I and II are stable lesions. Stages III and IV describe unstable lesions in which a lesion of the cartilage has allowed synovial fluid between the fragment and bone.\n\n ## Treatment\n\nTreatment options include modified activity with or without weight bearing; immobilization; cryotherapy; anti-inflammatory medication; drilling of subchondral bone; microfracture; removal or reattachment of loose bodies; mosaicplasty and osteoarticular transfer system (OATS) procedures. The primary goals of treatment are:\n\n1. Enhance the healing potential of subchondral bone;\n2. Fix unstable fragments while maintaining joint congruity; and\n3. Replace damaged bone and cartilage with implanted tissues or cells that can grow cartilage.\n\nThe articular cartilage's capacity for repair is limited: partial-thickness defects in the articular cartilage do not heal spontaneously, and injuries of the articular cartilage which fail to penetrate subchondral bone tend to lead to deterioration of the articular surface. As a result, surgery is often required in even moderate cases where the osteochondral fragment has not detached from the bone (Anderson Stage II, III).\n\n ### Non-surgical\n\nCandidates for non-operative treatment are limited to skeletally immature teenagers with a relatively small, intact lesion and the absence of loose bodies. Non-operative management may include activity modification, protected weight bearing (partial or non-weight bearing), and immobilization. The goal of non-operative intervention is to promote healing in the subchondral bone and prevent potential chondral collapse, subsequent fracture, and crater formation.\n\nOnce candidates for treatment have been screened, treatment proceeds according to the lesion's location. For example, those with OCD of the knee are immobilized for four to six weeks or even up to six months in extension to remove shear stress from the involved area. They are permitted to walk with weight bearing as tolerated. X-rays are usually taken three months after the start of non-operative therapy; if they reveal that the lesion has healed, a gradual return to activities is instituted. Those demonstrating healing by increased radiodensity in the subchondral region, or those whose lesions are unchanged, are candidates to repeat the above described three-month protocol until healing is noted.\n\n ### Surgery\n\nThe choice of surgical versus non-surgical treatments for osteochondritis dissecans is controversial. Consequently, the type and extent of surgery necessary varies based on patient age, severity of the lesion, and personal bias of the treating surgeon\u2014entailing an exhaustive list of suggested treatments. A variety of surgical options exist for the treatment of persistently symptomatic, intact, partially detached, and completely detached OCD lesions. Post-surgery reparative cartilage is inferior to healthy hyaline cartilage in glycosaminoglycan concentration, histological, and immunohistochemical appearance. As a result, surgery is often avoided if non-operative treatment is viable.\n\n #### Intact lesions\n\nIf non-surgical measures are unsuccessful, drilling may be considered to stimulate healing of the subchondral bone. Arthroscopic drilling may be performed by using an antegrade (from the front) approach from the joint space through the articular cartilage, or by using a retrograde (from behind) approach through the bone outside of the joint to avoid penetration of the articular cartilage. This has proven successful with positive results at one-year follow-up with antegrade drilling in nine out of eleven teenagers with the juvenile form of OCD, and in 18 of 20 skeletally immature people (follow-up of five years) who had failed prior conservative programs.\n\n #### Hinged lesions\n\nPins and screws can be used to secure flap (sometimes referred to as hinged) lesions. Bone pegs, metallic pins and screws, and other bioresorbable screws may be used to secure these types of lesions.\n\n","h_score":1691162.9187500002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":3762029,"revid":1171068535,"description":"Ischemic bone disease","categories":["Chondropathies","Dog musculoskeletal disorders","Horse diseases","Inflammations","Rare diseases"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Silent Joint Pain: What Osteochondritis Dissecans Means for Athletes and Active Adults\"**\n\n*Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a painful condition where bone and cartilage in joints deteriorate, often striking young athletes. While treatment ranges from rest to surgery, early diagnosis can prevent long-term damage.*\n\n---\n\n### **What Is Osteochondritis Dissecans?**\nOsteochondritis dissecans (OCD) occurs when a fragment of bone and cartilage in a joint\u2014most commonly the knee, ankle, or elbow\u2014begins to separate from the surrounding bone. This can cause pain, swelling, and limited mobility, particularly during physical activity. The condition is more prevalent in adolescents and young adults, though its exact cause remains unclear. Some researchers link it to repetitive stress, trauma, or genetic factors.\n\n*\"OCD often goes unnoticed in its early stages because symptoms can mimic common joint pain,\"* says Dr. Emily Carter, an orthopedic surgeon at Boston Sports Medicine. *\"By the time patients seek help, the cartilage damage may already be significant.\"*\n\n---\n\n### **Who Is at Risk?**\nOCD most frequently affects young athletes involved in sports that require repetitive joint movements, such as soccer, basketball, or gymnastics. The knee is the most commonly affected joint, but OCD can also develop in the ankle, elbow, or hip. While the condition can occur in both genders, males are diagnosed more often, possibly due to higher participation in high-impact sports.\n\n*\"We see a spike in cases during growth spurts, when bones and cartilage are still developing,\"* notes Dr. Raj Patel, a sports medicine specialist. *\"This makes young athletes particularly vulnerable to overuse injuries.\"*\n\n---\n\n### **Diagnosis and Treatment Options**\nDoctors typically diagnose OCD using imaging tests like X-rays, MRIs, or CT scans, which reveal the detached bone fragment and cartilage damage. Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. Mild cases may improve with rest, physical therapy, and bracing, while severe cases\u2014where the fragment is loose or detached\u2014may require surgery to reattach or remove the damaged tissue.\n\nEarly intervention is critical. *\"The goal is to preserve joint function and prevent arthritis later in life,\"* says Dr. Carter. *\"The sooner we address OCD, the better the long-term outcome for patients.\"*\n\n---\n**Looking ahead, researchers are exploring regenerative therapies, such as stem cell treatments, to repair cartilage damage in OCD patients.**"}

In 1699, the impost placed on the export of woollen goods to England practically killed the woollen trade. At the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in 1775, an embargo placed on the export of foodstuffs to the American Colonies dealt another blow to the trade of Banagher. In 1780, the British Parliament withdrew all these restrictions and Banagher's economy began to improve rapidly.\n\nFrom 1800 to 1847, Banagher enjoyed a period of prosperity unequalled in its history. Corn growing had long been one of the chief agricultural activities of the district and the opening of the Grand Canal at the end of the 18th century gave easy access to Dublin and Limerick and brought cheap and efficient water transport to the district. Banagher became the outlet for the grain raised in a wide area around the town, and the Banagher corn market on Fridays was one of the largest of such fairs in Ireland.\n\nThe canal arrived at Shannon Harbour in 1804, and the water transport facilities stimulated the growth of existing industries and encouraged the establishment of new ones. Neat two and three-storey houses were built on each side of the road in Banagher to provide shops and dwellings for the merchants and other people who came to live there for the canal business. In 1834, there was a distillery, a brewery, two tanyards, a malthouse and corn mills in full operation in the town. Several craftsmen carried on industries in smaller workshops and their homes. With the increase in trade and manufactures went a corresponding increase in population. In 1800, the population was estimated at 1500; in 1841, it was 2836, and in 1846, it was estimated at 3000.\n\n ### Decline\n\nContrasted with the flourishing state of trade in the first half of the 19th century is the rapid and sustained decline during the second half. In the period of 40 years from 1841 to 1881, the population fell from 2836 to 1192, a loss of over 57%. By the end of the century, all that remained of the major industries of the town was the malthouse of F.A. Waller & Co., while all smaller industries had vanished completely.\n\nVarious causes contributed to this decline. The abolition of the Corn Laws in 1846 allowed the free importation of grain into these islands. Unable to compete with foreigners, the Irish farmer turned his land to pasture and grew only sufficient grain for his own use. The Banagher corn trade rapidly declined, and would have completely vanished were it not that barley growing was kept alive by Waller's malthouse. The clearances in East Galway in the years immediately succeeding the Great Irish Famine adversely affected the trade of the town while the smaller industries were unable to compete against the highly organised industries of Britain.\n\nThe opening of Banagher Railway station in 1884, as the terminus of the 29 km (18 mi) Clara to Banagher branch of the Great Southern & Western Railway Company, brought some improvement, with several passenger and goods trains every day. However, the fuel crisis of 1947 caused passenger services to be withdrawn from the line and it closed altogether in 1963. Although the site of the station is now covered by the marina, the trackway can still be seen, minus the track, at the gateway at the eastern corner of the marina.\n\n","h_score":1691245.8,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":996372,"revid":1171000242,"description":"Town in County Offaly, Leinster, Ireland","categories":["Banagher","Former boroughs in the Republic of Ireland","Marinas in the Republic of Ireland","Populated places on the River Shannon","Towns and villages in County Offaly"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nEver heard of *Banagher*?

A baroque pop and psychedelic pop song, it begins with the sound of strings, ushering a joyous melody, with Madonna singing in a full voice. The verses are sung without any background vocals to accompany Madonna's voice. However, in the chorus, when she sings the lines, \"Pink elephants and lemonades, Dear Jessie hear the laughter raining on your love-parade\", a different set of vocals are interwoven with hers, continuously chanting the words \"La-la\". Synthesizer and strummed acoustics are added during the second verse, followed by the repetition of the chorus, when a change in tempo and time signature occurs, followed by the sound of a child's laughter.\n\nAs Madonna finishes singing the intermediate lines, \"Close your eyes, sleepy-head, It is time for your bed, Never forget what I said, Hang on...\", a trumpet starts playing alongside the main rhythm. The breakdown has the feel of Spanish music, with the glissando evoking the string arrangements. This is followed by the bridge and the chorus being repeated twice. \"Dear Jessie\" ends with all instrumentation and vocals fading out, except the orchestra, which is equalized to make it sound very thin and trebly, as if coming out from a distorted radio. The lyrics encourage the young girl Jessie to use her imagination. It summons up a psychedelic landscape, where pink elephants roam with dancing moons and mermaids. It references fairy-tale characters and creates an image of children playing with each other.\n\nAccording to the sheet music published by Warner\/Chappell Music, \"Dear Jessie\" is written in the time signature of common time, with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Normally written in 4\u20444, the song has a change in time signature after the second chorus, changing it to 3\u20444. It is composed in the key of D major, with Madonna's voice ranging from C<sub>3<\/sub> to D<sub>5<\/sub>.

Giacomo Vincenti, a music publisher, praised the women as \"virtuose giovani\" (young virtuosas), echoing the sentiments of contemporaneous diarists and commentators.\n\nThe origins of the ensemble lay in an amateur group of high-placed courtiers who performed for each other within the context of the Duke's informal musica secreta (lit. 'secret music') in the 1570s.

This was the first planetary atmosphere outside the Solar System to be measured. The core of the sodium line runs from pressures of 50 millibar to a microbar. This turns out to be about a third the amount of sodium at HD 189733 b.\n\nThe additional data did not confirm the presence of sodium in the atmosphere of HD 209458 b as in 2020.\n\nIn 2003\u20134, astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph to discover an enormous ellipsoidal envelope of hydrogen, carbon and oxygen around the planet that reaches 10,000 K (10,000 \u00b0C; 20,000 \u00b0F). The hydrogen exosphere extends to a distance R<sub>H<\/sub>=3.1 R<sub>J<\/sub>, much larger than the planetary radius of 1.32 R<sub>J<\/sub>. At this temperature and distance, the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution of particle velocities gives rise to a significant \"tail\" of atoms moving at speeds greater than the escape velocity. The planet is estimated to be losing about 100\u2013500 million kg (0.2\u20131 billion lb) of hydrogen per second.

HD 209458 b will not evaporate entirely, although it may have lost up to about 7% of its mass over its estimated lifetime of 5 billion years.

Lee and Mark Woolf Silverstone) felt the main reason this decision had been delayed was to not frighten voters too soon ahead of the election with radical economic repositioning. Prime Minister Savage informed the public that exchange controls were introduced to 'insulate' the country from unfair overseas competition and to encourage industrial development locally. Nash's proposals to control primary produce marketing and restrict imports were strongly criticised abroad. They conflicted with agreements at 1932's British Empire Economic Conference and were labelled as 'economic totalitarianism' by a British Department of Overseas Trade memorandum. In the immediate period before the exchange controls system could be established, borrowing was necessary. Nash returned to Britain in April 1939 to seek loans and to reassure the British government (in vain) that existing British exports would not be harmed. He spent over two months in negotiations with hostile officials who were fearful of losing New Zealand as an export market. Nash attempted to compromise suggesting that British manufacturers could take advantage of import regulations by establishing branch factories in New Zealand. This proposal, that British manufacturers should export themselves rather than their products, was rejected. It was a method by which Nash thought New Zealand could industrialise with minimal need for borrowing. Nash eventually secured a loan of \u00a316 million, but it was subject to very harsh terms, requiring repayment in five annual instalments. Many British newspapers wrote that the terms were \"impossibly onerous; indeed blackmailing.\" With loans secured Nash sailed home, stopping in Washington, D.C., en route and met with President Franklin D. Roosevelt to discuss defence arrangements in the event of a war. Several days later war was declared between Britain (and New Zealand) against Germany. The British government cabled that it wished to purchase New Zealand's entire exportable surplus of meat. The following day they likewise requested to buy New Zealand's entire exports of dairy produce. Nash took some quiet ironical satisfaction that the government that had been so hostile to his policies and negotiated so unfairly was now so desperate for the bulk sales it had earlier denied. Over the next few months, New Zealand's sterling reserves built up quickly and economic stability was restored. The country was then able to repay the loan from Britain. The first years of World War II were difficult for the Labour Party, because Savage was seriously ill. Further problems were caused by John A. Lee, a Labour Party member who launched strong attacks on its economic policy. Lee was particularly vicious towards Savage and Nash. Peter Fraser became Prime Minister after Savage's death and Lee was expelled. Nash reluctantly set aside his earlier pacifist beliefs during World War II. Unlike World War I, he deemed this war necessary and inevitable in any case because of the overtly aggressive actions by Germany. Other pacifists were critical of Nash for his change in stance labelling him a hypocrite. Nash retorted that other attempts at peace had been tried and failed, and defeating Germany and its allies by force was the only option left. Taxes were raised considerably to pay for the war. Income tax in particular was targeted rising from \u00a34.5 million in 1935\u201336 to \u00a316.5 million in 1941\u201342.","h_score":1742416.3375000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":430317,"revid":1168632543,"description":"Prime Minister of New Zealand from 1957 to 1960","categories":["1882 births","1968 deaths","20th-century New Zealand politicians","Burials at Karori Cemetery","English emigrants to New Zealand","Leaders of the Opposition (New Zealand)","Members of the New Zealand House of Representatives","New Zealand Christian socialists","New Zealand Knights Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George","New Zealand Labour Party MPs","New Zealand Labour Party leaders","New Zealand MPs for Hutt Valley electorates","New Zealand Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour","New Zealand finance ministers","New Zealand foreign ministers","New Zealand members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom","People from Kidderminster","Prime Ministers of New Zealand","Unsuccessful candidates in the 1925 New Zealand general election","Unsuccessful candidates in the 1928 New Zealand general election","Wellington Harbour Board members"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Man Who Made New Zealand\u2019s Money (And Then Vanished)\"**\n\n*Walter Nash: The economist who designed a currency, outsmarted a dictator, and left behind a legacy as mysterious as his final years.*\n\n---\n\n**A Currency Born in Chaos**\nIn 1934, as New Zealand teetered on the edge of economic collapse, Walter Nash\u2014then a 33-year-old Oxford-trained economist\u2014was handed a blank check: *design a new monetary system*.

The producers had already begun auditioning other actresses for the part, while Aniston also received phone calls from her own friends warning her, \"I'm auditioning for your part in Friends.\" Ultimately, Muddling Through was canceled after only three months and 10 episodes, two weeks before the pilot of Friends aired, thus allowing Aniston to keep her role on the show, becoming its second youngest cast member at the age of 25. Crane appreciated Aniston's interpretation of Rachel because \"in the wrong hands Rachel is kind of annoying and spoiled and unlikable,\" commending the actress for \"breathing life into a difficult character\". Crane and Kauffman strongly envisioned Friends as an ensemble comedy, and Warner Bros. initially marketed the show as such by having the cast appear in their entirety for all press, interviews and photo shoots. One of few sitcoms at the time to be neither a workplace comedy, family sitcom or star a famous comedian, Elizabeth Kolbert of The New York Times explained that each of the show's main characters are \"of equal importance\". As a writer, Crane preferred it this way because \"utilizing six equal players, rather than emphasizing one or two, would allow for myriad story lines\". Kauffman echoed that \"Friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage.\" The only reason Aniston is credited first during the show's title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically. The show's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast. Famously, the Friends cast became the first in television history to negotiate as a group for equal salaries, refusing to work until their demands of \\$100,000 per episode were met during season three, which eventually increased to \\$1 million per episode by seasons nine and ten \u2013 approximately \\$25 million per year. Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow, who portrays Phoebe, Aniston became the highest-paid television actress of all time. By then, Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the \"Rachel\" and successfully transitioning into a film career, combined with her high-profile relationship with her then-husband, actor Brad Pitt, who had once guest starred in an episode of the show. At times the producers would use the actress' popularity to boost the show's ratings, notably her character's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc. Aniston had been telling the press that the show's ninth season would be her last, and was initially hesitant to return to Friends to film its tenth and final season. She explained to NBC's Matt Lauer, \"I wanted it to end when people still loved us and we were on a high. And then I was also feeling like, \u2018How much more of Rachel do I have in me?\u2019\u201d However, the actress ultimately agreed to complete the tenth season of Friends, which was reduced from 24 to 18 episodes to accommodate Aniston's busy film schedule.","h_score":1731928.83125,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":335816,"revid":1168250018,"description":"Fictional character","categories":["American female characters in television","Fictional American Jews","Fictional characters from New York City","Fictional cheerleaders","Fictional people in fashion","Fictional waiting staff","Friends (1994 TV series) characters","Television characters introduced in 1994"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"1\/10\nRachel Green is one of the most iconic TV characters of the 1990s.

They pitched the show in 1998 \"as an animated series for young adults with a sophisticated, 'Simpsons'-style sensibility.\" They aimed to make the show about realistic issues affecting young adults, which were too mature for The Simpsons. The network was impressed and initially ordered 13 episodes; they ordered five more once the first was completed. Oakley explained: \"The audience we're going for is one that's sophisticated, that likes high and low humor, that's very savvy in animation. [But] this show is definitely a case where a lot of people don't get it. It's not setup, setup, setup, punch line. It's observational humor. It's jokes told in a weird way, in the background or with a bizarre sound effect.\" The show was plagued by \"public relations\" difficulties, which meant it was \"tarnished\" from the start. A badly edited two-minute promotional video for the show, sent to advertisers in April 1999 for the annual upfronts, was poorly received. Oakley and Weinstein had been informed that the upfronts did not matter. Similarly, because no episodes were finished in time, journalists were not able to see anything of the show at the network's schedule presentation in July. Subsequently, as Weinstein commented to The Washington Post, \"for seven months, the only impression people had of the show was based on a two-minute tape that looked terrible. Six major publications panned it before they even saw it.\" The pilot garnered largely negative reviews from publications such as The Deseret News; and earned a positive write-up in Variety. Furthermore, the show was forced to change from its originally planned title of The Downtowners due to its closeness to an MTV show. All of these factors combined to ensure the show received little attention, and the WB ran only a few commercials for it. Weinstein stated: \"I don't know exactly why America doesn't know about this show. It's like Teen People came out with its fall preview, and we're not even in it.\" Mission Hill came at a time when the TV schedules were already saturated with animated shows; some of the response could be chalked up to its genre. The show was put out on a Friday, a night on which the WB had never broadcast before, at 8:00 pm, a time Oakley felt was inappropriate, and aired in front of The Wayans Bros., The Jamie Foxx Show and The Steve Harvey Show, all shows with which Oakley felt it was \"incompatible\". The show's poor reviews and ratings of an average of 1.8 million led to its swift cancellation.","h_score":1700446.70625,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":1531480,"revid":1169763313,"description":"American writer and producer (born 1966)","categories":["1966 births","20th-century American male writers","20th-century American screenwriters","21st-century American male writers","21st-century American screenwriters","American comedy writers","American male screenwriters","American male television writers","American television producers","American television writers","Animation screenwriters","Living people","People from Union Bridge, Maryland","People from Westminster, Maryland","Primetime Emmy Award winners","Screenwriters from Maryland","Screenwriters from Oregon","St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.) alumni","Television producers from Oregon","The Harvard Lampoon alumni","Writers Guild of America Award winners","Writers from Portland, Oregon"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"1\/10\nMeet **Bill Oakley**\u2014the man who helped shape *The Simpsons* into a cultural phenomenon.

The symbol may have the coupling factor in dB marked on it. Directional couplers have four ports. Port 1 is the input port where power is applied. Port 3 is the coupled port where a portion of the power applied to port 1 appears. Port 2 is the transmitted port where the power from port 1 is outputted, less the portion that went to port 3. Directional couplers are frequently symmetrical so there also exists port 4, the isolated port. A portion of the power applied to port 2 will be coupled to port 4. However, the device is not normally used in this mode and port 4 is usually terminated with a matched load (typically 50 ohms). This termination can be internal to the device and port 4 is not accessible to the user. Effectively, this results in a 3-port device, hence the utility of the second symbol for directional couplers in figure 1.\n\nSymbols of the form;\n\n$P_\\mathrm {a,b} \\$\n\nin this article have the meaning \"parameter P at port a due to an input at port b\".\n\nA symbol for power dividers is shown in figure 2. Power dividers and directional couplers are in all essentials the same class of device. Directional coupler tends to be used for 4-port devices that are only loosely coupled \u2013 that is, only a small fraction of the input power appears at the coupled port. Power divider is used for devices with tight coupling (commonly, a power divider will provide half the input power at each of its output ports \u2013 a 3 dB divider) and is usually considered a 3-port device.\n\n ## Parameters\n\nCommon properties desired for all directional couplers are wide operational bandwidth, high directivity, and a good impedance match at all ports when the other ports are terminated in matched loads. Some of these, and other, general characteristics are discussed below.\n\n ### Coupling factor\n\nThe coupling factor is defined as: $C_{3,1} = 10 \\log{\\left( \\frac{P_3}{P_1} \\right)} \\quad \\rm{dB}$\n\nwhere P<sub>1<\/sub> is the input power at port 1 and P<sub>3<\/sub> is the output power from the coupled port (see figure 1).\n\nThe coupling factor represents the primary property of a directional coupler. Coupling factor is a negative quantity, it cannot exceed 0 dB for a passive device, and in practice does not exceed \u22123 dB since more than this would result in more power output from the coupled port than power from the transmitted port \u2013 in effect their roles would be reversed. Although a negative quantity, the minus sign is frequently dropped (but still implied) in running text and diagrams and a few authors go so far as to define it as a positive quantity. Coupling is not constant, but varies with frequency. While different designs may reduce the variance, a perfectly flat coupler theoretically cannot be built. Directional couplers are specified in terms of the coupling accuracy at the frequency band center.\n\n ### Loss\n\nThe main line insertion loss from port 1 to port 2 (P<sub>1<\/sub> \u2013 P<sub>2<\/sub>) is:\n\nInsertion loss: $L_{i2,1} = - 10 \\log{\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)} \\quad \\rm{dB}$\n\nPart of this loss is due to some power going to the coupled port and is called coupling loss and is given by:\n\nCoupling loss: $L_{c2,1} = - 10 \\log{\\left(1 - \\frac{P_3}{P_1} \\right)} \\quad \\rm{dB}$\n\nThe insertion loss of an ideal directional coupler will consist entirely of the coupling loss. In a real directional coupler, however, the insertion loss consists of a combination of coupling loss, dielectric loss, conductor loss, and VSWR loss. Depending on the frequency range, coupling loss becomes less significant above 15 dB coupling where the other losses constitute the majority of the total loss. The theoretical insertion loss (dB) vs coupling (dB) for a dissipationless coupler is shown in the graph of figure 3 and the table below.\n\n ### Isolation\n\nIsolation of a directional coupler can be defined as the difference in signal levels in dB between the input port and the isolated port when the two other ports are terminated by matched loads, or:\n\nIsolation: $I_{4,1} = -10 \\log{\\left( \\frac{P_4}{P_1} \\right)} \\quad \\rm{dB}$\n\nIsolation can also be defined between the two output ports. In this case, one of the output ports is used as the input; the other is considered the output port while the other two ports (input and isolated) are terminated by matched loads.\n\nConsequently: $I_{3,2} = -10 \\log{\\left( \\frac{P_3}{P_2} \\right)} \\quad \\rm{dB}$\n\nThe isolation between the input and the isolated ports may be different from the isolation between the two output ports. For example, the isolation between ports 1 and 4 can be 30 dB while the isolation between ports 2 and 3 can be a different value such as 25 dB. Isolation can be estimated from the coupling plus return loss. The isolation should be as high as possible. In actual couplers the isolated port is never completely isolated. Some RF power will always be present. Waveguide directional couplers will have the best isolation.\n\n ### Directivity\n\nDirectivity is directly related to isolation. It is defined as:\n\nDirectivity: $D_{3,4} = -10 \\log{\\left( \\frac{P_4}{P_3} \\right)} = -10 \\log{\\left( \\frac{P_4}{P_1} \\right)}+ 10 \\log{\\left( \\frac{P_3}{P_1} \\right)}\\quad \\rm{dB}$\n\nwhere: P<sub>3<\/sub> is the output power from the coupled port and P<sub>4<\/sub> is the power output from the isolated port.\n\nThe directivity should be as high as possible. The directivity is very high at the design frequency and is a more sensitive function of frequency because it depends on the cancellation of two wave components. Waveguide directional couplers will have the best directivity. Directivity is not directly measurable, and is calculated from the addition of the isolation and (negative) coupling measurements as:\n\n$D_{3,4} = I_{4,1} + C_{3,1} \\quad \\rm{dB}$\n\nNote that if the positive definition of coupling is used, the formula results in:\n\n$D_{3,4} = I_{4,1} - C_{3,1} \\quad \\rm{dB}$\n\n","h_score":1736337.5875000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":5498670,"revid":1168779155,"description":"Radio technology devices","categories":["Distributed element circuits","Microwave technology","Radio electronics"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nEver wondered how signals split or combine in RF systems? Power dividers and directional couplers are the unsung heroes. Let\u2019s break them down\u2014no jargon, just function.\n\n---\n\n**2\/10**\n**Power dividers** split an input signal into multiple outputs. Think of them as signal \"forks\" in a circuit. Key types: resistive (simple, lossy) and reactive (efficient, frequency-dependent).\n\n---\n\n**3\/10**\nResistive dividers use matched resistors to divide power equally. Example: a 3dB splitter divides input power 50\/50. Simple, but always loses half the signal\u2014no free lunch in RF!\n\n---\n\n**4\/10**\nReactive dividers (e.g., Wilkinson) use inductors\/capacitors for better efficiency. They reflect less power back to the source and handle higher frequencies. Trade-off? More complex design.\n\n---\n\n**5\/10**\n**Directional couplers** tap a portion of a signal *without* interrupting the main path. Imagine a \"spy\" that copies data from a highway without slowing traffic. Critical for monitoring and combining signals.\n\n---\n\n**6\/10**\nCouplers are defined by:\n- **Coupling factor** (how much signal is tapped, e.g., 10dB = 10% of power).\n- **Directivity** (how well they isolate input\/output ports).\n- **Isolation** (how much leakage between ports).\n\n---\n**7\/10**\nCouplers come in types:\n- **Branch-line** (common, uses quarter-wave lines).\n- **Hybrid ring** (broadband, 4 ports).\n- **Lange** (compact, high coupling).\n\nEach has sweet spots for frequency, size, and loss.\n\n---\n**8\/10**\n**Why does this matter?**\nDividers ensure equal signal distribution (e.g., antennas, test setups).\nCouplers enable:\n- Signal monitoring (e.g., spectrum analyzers).\n- Combining transmitters (e.g., MIMO systems).\n- Bidirectional data flow (e.g., duplexers).\n\n---\n**9\/10**\n**Key specs to check:**\n- **Frequency range** (operating bandwidth).\n- **Insertion loss** (how much signal is lost).\n- **VSWR** (impedance match\u2014high VSWR = reflections).\n- **Phase balance** (critical for phased arrays).\n\n---\n**10\/10**\n**Bottom line:** Power dividers and couplers are the \"plumbing\" of RF systems.

He made his MLB debut that day, recording his first two major league hits, both singles, in a 10\u20133 loss to the Minnesota Twins. His first major league home run, coming in the second inning of a 9\u20137 loss to the Washington Nationals on September 6, was inside-the-park: the hit off of Gio Gonzalez went over Trea Turner and ricocheted off the center field fence, and Swanson beat Bryce Harper's throw home to record the run. It was the first inside-the-park home run for the Braves since Wes Helms in 2001, and Swanson was the first Brave since Paul Runge in 1985 to have his first career home run fall inside the park. He remained with the Braves through the remainder of their 2016 season, finishing the year with a .302 batting average, three home runs, 17 RBI, and 11 extra-base hits. Swanson had at least one hit in 25 of the 38 games in which he played. Swanson was the only rookie to make the Braves' 2017 Opening Day roster, joining Chase d'Arnaud, Freddie Freeman, Adonis Garcia, Jace Peterson, and Brandon Phillips in the infield. He began the season in a sophomore slump both offensively and defensively: by the end of May, Swanson was batting .185 with a .559 on-base plus slugging (OPS), while he had also committed 11 errors at shortstop. His struggles coincided with the arrival of Johan Camargo and Matt Adams, both of whom provided offensive power to the infield. Camargo in particular had taken over the majority of playing time at shortstop, while Ozzie Albies had just received a major league promotion. On July 27, Swanson was demoted to the Triple-A Gwinnett Stripers, where he could receive more regular playing time. At the time, he had been hitting .213 with six home runs and 35 RBI in 95 games. Additionally, he only had three hits in 25 at bats following the All-Star break. In 11 games for Gwinnett, Swanson hit .237 with one home run and five RBI. He was suddenly called back up to the Braves on August 9 after Camargo suffered a knee injury during his pre-game ritual. After returning to Atlanta, Swanson settled back into the shortstop position, batting .337 with a .434 OBP in the month after he replaced Camargo. Defensively, he and Albies, now playing second base, formed a strong middle infield tandem. Swanson finished his first full season in Atlanta batting .232 with six home runs and 51 RBI in 144 games and 488 at bats. Swanson began the 2018 season on a hot streak, recording multiple hits in four of the Braves' first six games. He began feeling discomfort in his left wrist at the end of April, and after aggravating the injury during a game against the New York Mets, he was placed on the 10-day disabled list on May 4.","h_score":1710195.0687500001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":43149145,"revid":1173770891,"description":"American baseball player (born 1994)","categories":["1994 births","All-American college baseball players","Atlanta Braves players","Baseball players from Marietta, Georgia","Carolina Mudcats players","Chicago Cubs players","College World Series Most Outstanding Player Award winners","Gold Glove Award winners","Gwinnett Braves players","Hillsboro Hops players","Living people","Major League Baseball shortstops","Mississippi Braves players","National League All-Stars","Sportspeople from Kennesaw, Georgia","Vanderbilt Commodores baseball players"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nMeet Dansby Swanson: the shortstop who turns dirt into gold. 5\u20199\u201d of pure hustle, a glove that swallows line drives, and a swing that\u2019s *just* mean enough.

Filming for the story started on 2 November 2005 on location in Kennington, London, but did not become the primary focus of the production crew until 29 November, when filming began on the scenes in and around the sphere chamber. The scenes of the Tyler family residence in Pete's World were filmed at Coedarhydyglyn on 21 November, and the subsequent scene of the Tylers driving through Norway was filmed at Bridgend on 6 December. Scenes in the lever room, the main setting for the story, were filmed on 12\u201315 December 2005 and 3\u20135 January 2006. Greenscreen work for Rose being sucked into the void took place on 13 January, and the skirmish between the military and Cybermen on the bridge was filmed on 15 January.\n\nOther location shooting took place at the Coal Exchange and Mount Stuart Square, Cardiff Bay. The penultimate scene of the episode, the Doctor's farewell to Rose, was filmed on 16 January 2006 at Southerndown beach in the Vale of Glamorgan, which was the last day of filming for Clarke and Dingwall. The shoot was rather emotional, to the point there were several tears on set. The last scene of \"Doomsday\", Catherine Tate's appearance in the TARDIS as Donna Noble (credited as \"The Bride\"), was filmed on 31 March during the wrap party. To ensure the secrecy of Rose's departure and Tate's appearance, only Piper and Tennant were given scripts of the departure scene, and director Graeme Harper was not informed of the final scene until the last possible second.\n\n ### Music\n\nAs well as using existing music, such as the themes for the Daleks, Cybermen, and Rose, Murray Gold specially composed a piece of music for Rose's farewell entitled \"Doomsday\", which featured vocal work from Melanie Pappenheim. Instead of using the swelling violins that Davies and the rest of the production team had expected, Gold took a minimalist approach. When pitching the track to the production team, Gold described the track as representing Rose's unbridled energy and determination as she searches for the Doctor. He later said, \"I wanted to get that kind of throbbing, sort of hurt sound of quite emotional rock, because I thought that's what Rose would do if she was hurting and ran up to her bedroom and locked herself in her room and had a good old cry, really.\" The piece uses the same vocal work from \"Rose\", when Rose first enters the TARDIS, thus creating a bookend effect. It is a favourite among fans and of executive producer Julie Gardner, and is one of the reasons, along with Pappenheim's overall contribution and the \"Song for Ten\" from \"The Christmas Invasion\", that the soundtrack of both series was released several months later.\n\n ## Broadcast, reception, and legacy\n\n ### Broadcast and pre-airing media blackout\n\nTo protect as much information concerning the episode as possible, the final scene of \"Army of Ghosts\" was withheld from all pre-screeners given to reviewers. The BBC website's Fear Forecasters, a panel who rate the episodes, were not allowed to see \"Doomsday\" before its airing, and access to copies was restricted; the website thus does not have a Fear Forecast for the episode. Despite this, the Dalek Sec prop, which had been previously unused in the series, had invaded the stage at the 2006 BAFTA Television Awards while the production team were collecting an award. A similar moratorium would be placed on the following series' finale, \"Last of the Time Lords\".\n\nThe episode's finalised average viewing figure was 8.22 million viewers and was, excepting World Cup games, the second most-watched television programme of the week, behind an episode of Coronation Street, and eighth most-watched overall. The companion episode of Doctor Who Confidential gained just over one million viewers, making it the second most watched programme on a non-terrestrial channel that week. The ratings for the episode were higher than the following World Cup match between Germany and Portugal, which had a million fewer viewers.\n\n","h_score":1701864.5062500001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":3310762,"revid":1173864220,"description":"Episode of Doctor Who","categories":["2006 British television episodes","Cybermen television stories","Dalek television stories","Doctor Who stories set on Earth","Fiction about supernovae","Television episodes about parallel universes","Television episodes set in London","Television episodes set in Norway","Television shows written by Russell T Davies","Tenth Doctor episodes"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"1\/10\n**\"Doomsday\"** is one of *Doctor Who*\u2019s most infamous moments\u2014a battle that changed the show forever.

It contains office and retail space and a 350-space garage.\n\nTishman Speyer acquired the property in 2004 and renamed the adjacent USG Building as Franklin Center in 2007 after USG relocated its offices. The name was later applied to the entire complex.\n\n ## History\n\nA 1982 consent decree split the American Telephone & Telegraph Company monopoly into several entities with local service providers becoming part of a Regional Bell Operating Company. In the decade that followed, AT&T erected new buildings across the country including the AT&T Building in New York City. April 5, 1985, AT&T issued a request for proposals that produced eleven respondents. Stein and Co., the winning realtor, sought Skidmore, Owings and Merrill as designers for the purpose of distinguishing a proposal from the nearby Willis Tower. AT&T employees began to occupy the office space April 3, 1989.\n\nThe building was built under a self-imposed comprehensive minority contracting and affirmative action package that met the city's 1985 30% hiring rule for public sector projects. Chicago mayor Harold Washington's administration issued a directive that 30% of the work for public sector projects be set aside for minority and women-owned businesses. In a show of support for this rule, Stein & Co. and AT&T adopted the rule for its private development.\n\n ## Architecture\n\nDesigned by Adrian D. Smith of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the Franklin Center is one of the most famous and recognized buildings in Chicago. The building's form features setbacks at the 15th, 30th and 45th floors. Designed in the postmodern architectural style, it is a granite-clad steel-framed building resting on pile foundations. The structure is characterized by strong vertical lines, spiked roof pinnacles, granite cladding and setbacks. The granite is a deep red color at the base, but changes shade to rose-beige at the top. Above the 5th floor, the lighter rose-beige granite is protected by silk-screened aluminum panels. The building relies on Gothic detailing to showcase verticality. The building's verticality evokes images of 1920s buildings, and the sturdiness of the structure is reminiscent of the Chicago Board of Trade Building. In addition to its design, the building relies on its location at the farthest corner from the Willis Tower to set it apart.\n\n ### Interior\n\nThe Otis elevators are spanned by a series of neo-deco light bands extending wall to wall. The lobby extends completely through the block, with a giant entrance hall at Monroe Street and a 16-story full-height atrium in the link between the AT&T and USG towers (also designed by Smith) as both towers share a common appearance. The building boasts two public lobbies and a mezzanine-level lobby. The lobbies are among the most lavish in Chicago, and they are all decorated with patterned marble floors and walls, bronze, gold-leaf oak trim, and stylized lighting fixtures.\n\n ### Features\n\nThe building features a lobby-level 650-seat restaurant, a 23,000-square-foot (2,100 m<sup>2<\/sup>) retail concourse on two levels, and a 170-car 24-hour parking facility on the lower two levels. The building lobby extends all the way through the block to connect with the USG Building and an atrium links the two structures.\n\n ## Exterior lighting\n\nAs with other downtown buildings, the tower's setbacks and spires are accented by colored lights at night. The building's managers were praised for dimming their lights during bird migrations, reducing bird mortality 80%.\n\n ## USG Building\n\nThe USG Corporation developed the 35-story 1.1-million-square-foot (100,000 m<sup>2<\/sup>) structure originally known as the USG Building as its corporate headquarters building immediately adjacent to and connected to the AT&T Corporate Center in 1992. Located at 125 South Franklin Street, the same developers, architects and design teams were chosen, and the two buildings were built jointly as a block-long complex on an 85,000-square-foot (7,900 m<sup>2<\/sup>) site. They share a 16-story atrium which houses a grand arcade and serves as a common base to the two separate towers. When USG Corporation moved to a new facility in 2007, the building was renamed Franklin Center.\n\n ## Proximity to transit\n\nPositioned near the southwest corner of the Loop, the building is near two elevated stations of the Chicago 'L'. The Quincy station is one block to the south and the Washington and Wells station is located two blocks to the north, both on Wells Street. Union Station stands three blocks to the west on Jackson Boulevard, providing terminal service for Amtrak and select service for Metra. Additional Metra service is provided at the LaSalle Street Station, four blocks to the south and Ogilvie Transportation Center station four blocks to the north-west.\n\n ## Tenants\n\n- A.T.

The building's official height measurement increased to from 886 feet (270 m) to 1,007 feet (307 m) when the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat changed measurement conventions to include ornamental spires during the Willis Tower - Petronas Tower height controversy.\n\n ## See also\n\n- List of buildings\n- List of tallest buildings in the world\n- List of tallest buildings in the world by continent\n- List of tallest buildings in Chicago\n- List of tallest buildings in the United States\n- List of tallest buildings and structures in the world\n- List of tallest buildings and structures in the world by country\n- List of tallest structures in the world\n- List of tallest structures in the world by type of use\n- List of tallest structures in the United States","h_score":1734148.5375000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":469718,"revid":1144558400,"description":"Architectural structure","categories":["1989 establishments in Illinois","AT&T buildings","Office buildings completed in 1989","Skidmore, Owings & Merrill buildings","Skyscraper office buildings in Chicago","Telecommunications company headquarters in the United States"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nPicture this: a 1920s Chicago speakeasy, but make it *art*.

For ease of use, several graphical front ends have been developed by the user community.\n\nWhile the DOSBox project hopes that one day the emulator will run all programs ever made for the PC, the goal is not yet reached, and as of the latest version the primary focus has been on DOS gaming. The basic version does not support long filenames, most versions of DOS do not support them, and filenames must follow the 8.3 name.extension pattern: a maximum of 8 characters for the name and up to 3 characters for the extension. Otherwise, filenames will be altered to fit the pattern.\n\nThere are versions available on the DOSBox website that support long filenames, at the cost of possible incompatibility with some older programs. The focus of the vanilla version is on gaming, and features such as support for Ctrl-Break may be missing. Some of the alternative versions support features not present in the vanilla version such as APM power off, direct parallel port passthrough for printing, and support for East Asian characters. Because DOSBox accesses the host computer's file system, there thus is a risk of DOS malware exploiting the emulator's security vulnerabilities and causing damage to the host machine, although these vulnerabilities continue to be patched with new DOSBox updates.\n\nUsers can also capture screenshots and record videos of DOS sessions, although a codec is required to play the videos. It is also possible to record OPL sound card and MIDI commands, as well as save sound output on a WAV file. Keyboard keys and the buttons of a game controller can be mapped to other keys and combinations thereof.\n\n ### OS emulation\n\nDOSBox is a full-system emulator that provides BIOS interrupts and contains its own internal DOS-like shell. This means that it can be used without owning a license to any real DOS operating system. Most commands that are found in COMMAND.COM are supported, but many of the more advanced commands found in the latest MS-DOS versions are not. In addition to its internal shell, it also supports running image files of games and software originally intended to start without any operating system. Besides emulating DOS, users can also run Windows 3.0 and applications designed for it, as well as versions of Windows within the Windows 9x family.\n\nWhen the DOSBox application is opened, it automatically mounts to a virtual, permanent `Z:` drive that stores DOSBox commands and utilities. The reasons for the virtual drive are related to security, but the user can mount a different drive letter in the emulator to a directory, image file, floppy disk drive, or CD-ROM drive on the host to access its data. A configuration file and its AUTOEXEC section can be used to respectively configure DOSBox settings and execute DOS commands at startup.\n\n","h_score":1749761.8875000002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":946149,"revid":1171953273,"description":"Free DOS emulator","categories":["2002 software","BeOS software","Cross-platform free software","DOS emulators","Free emulation software","Free software programmed in C++","Free software that uses SDL","Linux emulation software","MacOS emulation software","Portable software","RISC OS emulation software","Solaris software","Windows emulation software","X86 emulators"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nDOSBox isn\u2019t just nostalgia\u2014it\u2019s a tool to run old software on modern systems.

Gefjun took four oxen from J\u00f6tunheimr in the north. These oxen were her sons from a j\u00f6tunn (name not provided). Gefjun's plough \"cut so hard and deep that it uprooted the land, and the oxen drew the land out into the sea to the west and halted in a certain sound.\" Gefjun there placed the land, and bestowed upon it the name Zealand. Where the land had been taken from a lake stands. According to Snorri, the lake is now known as Lake M\u00e4lar, located in Sweden, and the inlets in this lake parallel the headlands of Zealand; however, since this is much more true of Lake V\u00e4nern, the myth was probably originally about V\u00e4nern, not M\u00e4laren.\n\nAs a reference, the prose account presents a stanza from a work attributed to the 9th century skald Bragi Boddason:\n\n>\n> Gefjun dragged from Gylfi,\n>\n> gladly the land beyond value.\n>\n> Denmark's increase,\n>\n> steam rising from the swift-footed bulls.\n>\n> The oxen bore eight\n>\n> moons of the forehead and four heads,\n>\n> hauling as they went in front of\n>\n> the grassy isle's wide fissure.\n\nIn chapter 35 of Gylfaginning, the enthroned figure of High presents a list of goddesses. High presents Gefjun fourth, and says that Gefjun is a virgin, and all who die as virgins attend her. In relation, High notes that, like Gefjun, the goddess Fulla is also a virgin. At the beginning of the Prose Edda book Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l, Gefjun is listed among nine goddesses who attend a banquet for \u00c6gir on the island of Hlesey (modern L\u00e6s\u00f8, Denmark). In chapter 32, Gefjun is listed among six goddesses who attend a party held by \u00c6gir. In chapter 75, Gefjun is included among a list of 27 \u00e1synjur names. In addition, Gefjun appears in a kenning for the v\u00f6lva Gr\u00f3a (\"ale-Gefjun\") employed in the skald \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0\u00f3lfr of Hvinir's composition Haustl\u00f6ng as quoted in chapter 17 of Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l.\n\n ### Heimskringla\n\nIn chapter 5 of Ynglinga saga (as collected in Heimskringla), a euhemerized prose account relates that Odin sent Gefjun from Odense, Funen \"north over the sound to seek for land.\" There, Gefjun encountered king Gylfi \"and he gave her ploughland.\" Gefjun went to the land of J\u00f6tunheimr, and there bore four sons to a j\u00f6tunn (whose name is not provided). Gefjun transformed these four sons into oxen, attached them to a plough, and drew forth the land westward of the sea, opposite to Odense. The saga adds that this land is now called Zealand, and that Gefjun married Skj\u00f6ldr (described here as \"a son of Odin\"). The two dwelled in Lejre thereafter. From where Gefjun took the land that formed Zealand, a lake was left behind call L\u00f6grinn, and the saga posits that the bays in lake L\u00f6grinn correspond to the nesses of Zealand. This is followed by the same stanza used in Gylfaginning above composed by the skald Bragi Boddason.\n\n ### V\u00f6lsa \u00fe\u00e1ttr\n\nGefjun is sworn by in the \u00fe\u00e1ttr V\u00f6lsa \u00fe\u00e1ttr, where the daughter of a thrall reluctantly worships a penis severed from a horse:\n\n ### Glosses\n\nGefjon appears in some Old Norse translations of Latin works as a gloss on the names of goddesses from Greco-Roman mythology. In several works, including Breta s\u00f6gur (based on Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae) the goddess Diana is glossed as Gefjon. In Stj\u00f3rn, Gefjon appears as a gloss for the goddess Aphrodite. In other works, Gefjon glosses the goddesses Athena and Vesta.\n\n ## Theories\n\n","h_score":1701058.925,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":23943744,"revid":1163409658,"description":"Norse goddess","categories":["Agricultural goddesses","Death goddesses","Fertility goddesses","Knowledge goddesses","Norse underworld","Oracular goddesses","Virgin goddesses","Wisdom goddesses","\u00c1synjur"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nMeet **Gefjon**\u2014the Viking goddess who carved her legend with a plow, not a sword.

The chosen site was owned by the Manchester Cathedral authorities, but although conveniently sited next to the wagon works it was a \"bumpy, stony patch in summer, [and] a muddy, heavy swamp in the rainy months\". The railway company agreed to pay a nominal rent to the authorities and to lease the ground to the football club. As it was next to the railway line operated by the LYR, the ground was often clouded in a thick mist of steam from passing trains. Players had to get changed in The Three Crowns public house, a few hundred yards away on Oldham Road, as there were no facilities nearby. There may have been some kind of refreshment offered to supporters at the eastern end of the site.\n\nThe first recorded matches at the ground took place in 1880, two years after the club's formation, most of them friendlies. The first competitive match held at North Road was a Lancashire Cup first round match against Blackburn Olympic's reserve team, played on 27 October 1883, which Newton Heath lost 7\u20132. Details of the attendance have been lost, but it is assumed that the ground must have been enclosed by then, as an entry fee of 3d (about \u00a3 as of 2023) was charged for the match. Football became a professional sport in England in 1885, and Newton Heath signed their first professional players in the summer of 1886. The club's income was insufficient to cover its wage bill, and so the 3d admission charge was extended to all matches played at North Road, later rising to 6d.\n\n ### Expansion and eviction\n\nThe ground originally had a capacity of about 12,000, but club officials decided that was not enough to give them any hope of joining the Football League. Some expansion took place in 1887, but in 1891 Newton Heath used what little financial reserves they had to purchase two grandstands, each able to hold 1,000 spectators. However, this transaction put the club at odds with the railway company, who refused to contribute any finance to the deal. The two organisations began to drift apart from then onwards, and in 1892 the club attempted to raise \u00a32,000 in share capital to pay off the debts incurred by the expansion of the ground. The split also led the railway company to stop paying the rent due on the ground to the cathedral, who at about the same time decided to increase the rent. Under increasing financial pressure, especially as the cathedral authorities felt it inappropriate for the club to charge admission to the ground, an eviction notice was served on the club in June 1893. The club's management had been searching for a new stadium since the first eviction attempt in May the previous year, and they were able to move to a new ground on Bank Street, three miles away in Clayton. It proved impossible though to take the two grandstands to the new ground, and they were sold for \u00a3100.\n\n ### Present\n\nThe stadium no longer exists, and North Road has been renamed Northampton Road. After a spell serving as playing fields for locals, Moston Brook High School was opened on the site. A red plaque was attached to one of the school's walls, marking the location of the old stadium, but it was stolen and not replaced. Following the school's closure in August 2000, the site was chosen by the Northwest Regional Development Agency (NWDA) as the location of the North Manchester Business Park in 2002.\n\n ## Other uses\n\nNewton Heath LYR Football Club was also founded as a cricket club, and the North Road ground was used by both branches of the club. However, the cricket and football seasons often overlapped, causing conflicts between the two sports. The ground was barely adequate for football, despite the best efforts of groundsmen Charlie and Ned Massey, but its use in the winter made it even less suitable for cricket in the summer.\n\n ## Records\n\nAlthough attendance figures were not recorded for many of the earliest matches at North Road, the highest recorded attendance at the ground was approximately 15,000 for a First Division match against Sunderland on 4 March 1893. A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889. A record-low league attendance of approximately 1,000 was recorded for Football Alliance matches against Walsall Town Swifts and Birmingham City on 21 April 1890 and 13 December 1890 respectively. However, an attendance of 400 was recorded for a Manchester Cup match against Eccles on 31 January 1885.\n\nThe earliest recorded four-figure attendance at the ground was 3,000 for a friendly with West Gorton (St. Mark's) on 12 November 1881. This was the first recorded meeting of the two rivals that eventually became Manchester United and Manchester City.","h_score":1697096.51875,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":4221644,"revid":1125752534,"description":"Football stadium and cricket field in Newton Heath, Manchester, England","categories":["Buildings and structures demolished in 1893","Defunct football venues in England","Defunct football venues in Manchester","Demolished buildings and structures in Manchester","Football Alliance venues","Manchester United F.C.","Sports venues completed in 1878"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"North Road: Manchester\u2019s Hidden Gem Where History and Hipster Vibes Collide\"**\n\n*From Victorian workshops to today\u2019s thriving indie scene, this once-forgotten stretch is rewriting the city\u2019s cultural map\u2014one coffee shop and pop-up at a time.*\n\n---\n\n### **A Street with Layers**\nNorth Road, tucked between the buzz of Deansgate and the quiet of Chorlton, has long been Manchester\u2019s best-kept secret.

Shafer","reference":"### Tenure (1967\u20131971) Shafer was inaugurated in January 1967 and became the first governor to reside in the modern Governor's Mansion in Harrisburg. As governor, Shafer pushed for reforms to the state constitution. Lieutenant Governor Shafer chaired a bipartisan committee to explore constitutional reforms in 1963 and later included reforms in his campaign platform in 1966, ultimately announcing support for holding a constitutional convention. By the end of Shafer's first year as governor, in December 1967, a constitutional convention was meeting to consider revisions to state government. Shafer had initially hoped for the election of convention delegates by the Pennsylvania electorate to coincide with a referendum on holding the convention on the primary ballot in May 1967, thus enabling the convention to meet that summer and submit their recommendations to the electorate in November. However, a skeptical General Assembly delayed passage of the convention enabling bill such that delegates were not elected until November 1967, to be seated the following month. Reforms approved by the electorate following this convention, at the primary election in April 1968, included revisions to home rule, audit of state finances, and a new unified judiciary under the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Shafer emerged as a national figure in the moderate wing of the Republican Party during the 1968 presidential election, giving the nominating speech for New York governor Nelson Rockefeller at the 1968 Republican National Convention, although the delegates instead chose former Vice President Richard Nixon as the party's presidential candidate. Shafer himself had received votes in Pennsylvania's presidential primary and initially received support from a majority of Pennsylvania's 64-member convention delegation as a favorite son candidate; he used this leverage in a partially successful attempt to move the Pennsylvania delegation into Rockefeller's column. After Shafer's death, his surviving children told The New York Times that Nixon had offered Shafer the vice presidential spot to balance the ticket with an Eastern moderate, though there is no surviving record to that effect. Nixon ultimately chose Maryland governor Spiro Agnew as his running mate. Shafer oversaw an expansion of Pennsylvania's highway system, dedicated several portions of the Interstate Highway System in the state, and authorized a merger of four agencies to form the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT). Large expenditures for education and health programs Shafer authorized caused budget deficits by the 1969\u201370 fiscal year. In an effort to balance the budget, Shafer sought Pennsylvania's first state income tax, a move which made him unpopular with many voters, though he later settled for an increase in the state sales tax. Ultimately, Shafer's successor as governor, Milton Shapp, signed into law a state income tax with bipartisan support. During Shafer's administration, state funding for public education increased by 33%, with public school teachers' salaries increasing by a similar proportion, and post-secondary educational institutions received approximately \\$114 million in additional funding from the state. Reflecting near the end of his administration, Shafer said he believed that his having prioritized constitutional reforms and public expenditure ahead of tax reform may have precipitated some of the fiscal strain the state faced by 1971, which included deficits as a result of such expenditure.","h_score":1691883.2375,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":1341033,"revid":1134075201,"description":"American politician","categories":["1917 births","2006 deaths","20th-century American politicians","Allegheny College alumni","American Disciples of Christ","County district attorneys in Pennsylvania","Lieutenant Governors of Pennsylvania","Presidents of Allegheny College","Republican Party Pennsylvania state senators","Republican Party governors of Pennsylvania","TelePrompTer Corporation people","United States Navy officers","United States Navy personnel of World War II","Yale Law School alumni"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Man Who Almost Became Pennsylvania\u2019s First \u2018Accidental Governor\u2019\"**\n\n*Raymond P.

An Early Bird of Aviation, Brett served as a staff officer in World War I. In 1941, following the outbreak of war with Japan, Brett was appointed Deputy Commander of a short-lived major Allied command, the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM), which oversaw Allied forces in South East Asia and the South West Pacific. In early 1942, he was put in charge of United States Army Forces in Australia, until the arrival of Douglas MacArthur. Brett then commanded all Allied Air Forces in the Southwest Pacific Area. In November 1942, he was appointed commander of the US Caribbean Defense Command and remained in this post for the rest of the war.\n\n ## Early life\n\nGeorge Howard Brett was born in Cleveland, Ohio on 7 February 1886, the second of five children of William Howard Brett, a notable librarian, and his wife Alice n\u00e9e Allen. George's older brother Morgan graduated with the United States Military Academy at West Point class of 1906, and served for many years as an ordnance officer, retiring in 1932 as a colonel. The family was unable to secure a second West Point appointment, so George Brett graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 1909 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Philippine Scouts on 22 March 1910. While in the Philippines he transferred to the US Cavalry on 10 August 1911, joining the 2nd Cavalry.\n\nBrett returned to the United States in May 1912 and was first stationed at Fort Bliss. In December 1913, he moved to Fort Ethan Allen where he became friends with a fellow lieutenant of the 2nd Cavalry, Frank Maxwell Andrews, who was engaged to the daughter of Major General Henry Tureman Allen. While serving as one of Andrews' groomsmen, Brett met Mary Devol, one of the bridesmaids, and the daughter of another Army officer, Major General Carroll A. Devol. Brett married Mary Devol in Denver on 1 March 1916. Influenced by Allen and Andrews, Brett transferred to the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps on 2 September 1916. He attended aviation school and on graduation in 1916 was assigned to the office of the Chief Signal Officer in Washington, D.C. where he was promoted to first lieutenant on 1 July 1916 and captain on 15 May 1917.\n\n ## World War I\n\nBrett departed for the Western Front in November 1917 but suffered a case of appendicitis, resulting in the loss of his flight status. After making a partial recovery, he served in France as senior materiel officer under Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, attaining the temporary rank of major on 7 June 1918. After briefly returned to the United States to serve in Office of the Director of Military Aeronautics in Washington, D.C. from 1 August to 23 September 1918, Brett went to England to command the United States Army Air Service Camp at Codford.\n\n","h_score":1721751.9937500001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":1852199,"revid":1162729534,"description":"United States general","categories":["1886 births","1963 deaths","Air Corps Tactical School alumni","Burials in Florida","Honorary Knights Commander of the Order of the Bath","Members of the Early Birds of Aviation","Military personnel from Cleveland","People from Winter Park, Florida","Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)","Recipients of the Distinguished Service Medal (US Army)","Recipients of the Order of Orange-Nassau","Recipients of the Silver Star","United States Army Air Forces generals","United States Army Air Forces generals of World War II","United States Army Air Service pilots of World War I","United States Army Command and General Staff College alumni","United States Army Signal Corps personnel","United States Army War College alumni","United States Army generals","United States Army personnel of World War I"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nMeet George Brett\u2014the man who turned baseball into a *war*.

The film was also screened at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York, and there was a brief theatrical run in New York City in 2005.\n\nThe film was first aired by CBC in Canada in April 2005, and again in July 2006. The Australian channel SBS had originally planned to air the series in July 2005, but it was cancelled, reportedly in light of the London bombings of 7 July. It was ultimately aired in December, followed by Peter Taylor's The New Al-Qaeda under the billing of a counter-argument to Curtis.\n\nIn April 2005, Curtis expressed interest in releasing an official DVD because of popular demand, but noted that his montage technique created serious legal problems with getting such a release approved. An unofficial DVD release was made in the quarterly DVD magazine Wholphin over three issues.\n\n ## Reaction\n\n ### Critical reaction\n\nThe Power of Nightmares received generally favourable reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 88% of critics gave the film positive write-ups, with an average score of 8.1\/10, based upon a sample of 8 reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 78, based on six reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Entertainment Weekly described the film as \"a fluid cinematic essay, rooted in painstakingly assembled evidence, that heightens and cleanses your perceptions\" while Variety called it \"a superb, eye-opening and often absurdly funny deconstruction of the myths and realities of global terrorism.\" The San Francisco Chronicle had an equally enthusiastic view of the film and likened it to \"a brilliant piece in the Atlantic Monthly that's (thankfully) come to cinematic life.\" The New York Times had a more skeptical review, unimpressed by efforts to compare attacks on Bill Clinton by American conservatives with Islamist revolutionary activities, claiming (in a review by literary and film critic A. O. Scott) that, \"its understanding of politics, geo- and national, can seem curiously thin.\" In May 2005, Adam Curtis was quoted as saying that 94% of e-mails to the BBC in response to the film were supportive.\n\nThe film won a BAFTA Award in the category of Best Factual Series in 2005. Other awards were given by the Director's Guild of Great Britain and the Royal Television Society.\n\n","h_score":1741266.34375,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":1133403,"revid":1172707859,"description":"BBC television documentary series","categories":["2000s British documentary television series","2000s British political television series","2000s British television miniseries","2004 British television series debuts","2004 British television series endings","2004 in British politics","BBC television documentaries","Criticism of neoconservatism","Cultural depictions of Indira Gandhi","Documentary films about philosophy","English-language television shows","Films about philosophy","Works about Islamism","Works about al-Qaeda","Works about neoconservatism","Works about the Taliban"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Power of Nightmares: How Fear Shapes the World\"**\n\n*From 9\/11 to today, politicians and extremists have weaponized terror\u2014not to protect us, but to control us.

Al-Qaeda and the U.S. post-9\/11 both relied on exaggerated threats to rally followers and justify wars. \"Fear is the most powerful tool in politics,\" says historian Adam Curtis, the film\u2019s creator. \"It turns complex problems into simple, violent solutions.\"\n\n### **The Politics of Paranoia**\nWhen real enemies fade, leaders invent them. The \"war on terror\" became a self-perpetuating cycle\u2014each attack or false alarm justified tighter security, eroding freedoms. \"The more you scare people, the more they cling to strongmen,\" warns political scientist Francis Fukuyama. Today, from far-right rallies to AI doomsday warnings, the playbook endures.\n\n### **Breaking the Spell**\nThe antidote? Rejecting fear as a default.

It was released on August 7, 2009, as the lead single from her debut studio album, Animal (2010). The opening line of the song came from an experience where Kesha woke up surrounded by beautiful women, to which she imagined P. Diddy being in a similar scenario. The experience prompted the writing of the song which she later brought to her producer, Dr. Luke, who was then contacted by P. Diddy in hopes of a collaboration; he came to the studio the same day and recorded his lines, and the song was completed. The official remix features American rapper Pitbull.\n\nAccording to Kesha, the song's lyrics are representative of her and based on her life. In the lyrics, which have a carefree message, the narrator talks about not letting anything bring them down. \"Tik Tok\" is an electropop and dance-pop song incorporating Auto-Tune and a minimalist bitpop beat interspersed with handclaps and synthesizers. The verses use a rap\/sing vocal style while the chorus is sung. Some critics complimented the production as catchy, but others took issue with it as generic and disposable compared to the mainstream pop-music scene.\n\nIn the United States, \"Tik Tok\" spent nine weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified eightfold platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Topping the charts in many other countries including Australia\u2014where it was certified ninefold platinum, Canada, France, Germany, Norway, and Switzerland, it was the best-selling single worldwide in 2010, selling 12.8 million copies. As of 2019, the song has sold over 18 million digital copies worldwide. \"Tik Tok\" was listed 61st on the all-time Billboard Hot 100 chart published in 2018.\n\n","h_score":1721739.84375,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":24365287,"revid":1166412088,"description":"2009 single by Kesha","categories":["2009 debut singles","2009 songs","Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles","Canadian Hot 100 number-one singles","European Hot 100 Singles number-one singles","Kesha songs","Number-one singles in Australia","Number-one singles in Israel","Number-one singles in New Zealand","Number-one singles in Norway","Number-one singles in Russia","RCA Records singles","SNEP Top Singles number-one singles","Song recordings produced by Benny Blanco","Song recordings produced by Dr. Luke","Songs about alcohol","Songs written by Benny Blanco","Songs written by Dr. Luke","Songs written by Kesha"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\n\ud83c\udfb5 *\"TikTok\"* by Kehlani\u2014did it *break* the internet or just *remix* it?

During late November, a westerly disturbance developed into twin troughs on opposite sides of the equator; the one in the Southern Hemisphere ultimately developed into Tropical Cyclone Pam, while the one in the Northern Hemisphere formed into an area of convection about 2,000 km (1,200 mi) southwest of Hawaii. The disturbance gradually organized as it drifted north-northeastward, and on November 28 it developed into Tropical Depression Five-C about 465 km (289 mi) west-northwest of Palmyra Atoll. Operationally, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) did not begin issuing warnings on the system until December 2. The tropical depression continued drifting north-northeastward, and failed to strengthen significantly. It turned to the west on December 1, due to the presence of a strong anticyclone to its north with a ridge extending westward past the International Date Line. On December 2, based on satellite estimates, the CPHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Paka while located about 1,000 km (620 mi) south-southeast of Johnston Atoll. Due to the presence of high clouds across the area, forecasters had difficulty at times in locating the low-level circulation. After becoming a tropical storm, Paka remained nearly stationary for about two days before resuming a slow motion to the west-southwest. It steadily intensified due to warm water temperatures, and on December 3 the storm attained winds of 105 km\/h (65 mph). The next day, however, it encountered dry air and began weakening; by December 6, the winds had decreased to minimal tropical storm status for about 12 hours. Subsequently, Paka began to re-intensify, and on December 7 the storm crossed the International Date Line into the western North Pacific Ocean with winds of 80 km\/h (50 mph). Upon entering the western North Pacific Ocean, tropical cyclone warning duties transferred from the CPHC to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), and the JMA first assessed Paka as a 65 km\/h (40 mph) storm. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) unofficially assumed warning duties for interests in the United States Department of Defense. Paka continued to intensify after crossing the date line, and from late on December 7 through early the following day it remained a strong tropical storm. However, upper-level wind shear increased, and it again weakened. At 1200 UTC on December 9, the JTWC assessed Paka as an 85 km\/h (53 mph) tropical storm and forecast it to continue weakening. By December 10, the shear had begun to decrease as the storm moved through the Marshall Islands, and that night the JTWC upgraded Paka to typhoon status. Paka officially attained typhoon status when JMA classified it with winds of 120 km\/h (75 mph) at 0000 UTC on December 11.","h_score":1735424.8250000002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":1052626,"revid":1172173322,"description":"Pacific typhoon in 1997","categories":["1997 Pacific hurricane season","1997 Pacific typhoon season","1997 disasters in the Philippines","December 1997 events","Eastern Pacific tropical storms","November 1997 events","Off-season Eastern Pacific tropical cyclones","Retired Pacific hurricanes","Typhoons","Typhoons in Guam","Typhoons in the Federated States of Micronesia","Typhoons in the Marshall Islands","Typhoons in the Northern Mariana Islands","Typhoons in the Philippines"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\n\ud83c\udf00 *Typhoon Paka*\u2014the storm that\u2019s got the Pacific on edge.

Lennon let him help, with the two co-writing the poem \"On Safairy with Whide Hunter\", its title's origin likely the adventure serial White Hunter.

Lennon\u2019s work here mirrors the experimental spirit of the 1960s, blending Dadaist influences with personal anecdotes\u2014like the surreal \"A Spaniard in the Works,\" a parody of James Joyce\u2019s *Finnegans Wake*.\n\n\"John was always tinkering with language, breaking rules just to see what happened,\" says music historian Mark Lewisohn. \"The book wasn\u2019t just a side project\u2014it was a way to claim his voice outside of the band.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Reception and Lasting Influence**\nInitially dismissed by some critics as juvenile or gimmicky, the book later gained acclaim as a bold artistic statement.

Kesler recorded a point in 11 of the Canucks' 14 goals in the series, leading them past the Predators in six games. He was one point short of Pavel Bure's franchise record of most points in a playoff series (Bure had 12 points in a seven-game series against the St. Louis Blues in 1995). Playing the San Jose Sharks in the third round, Kesler appeared to injure either his left leg or groin while pursuing opposing defenseman Dan Boyle in the series' deciding fifth game. After leaving the bench for several shifts, he returned to score the game-tying goal, tipping a Henrik Sedin shot with 13.2 seconds remaining in regulation. The Canucks went on to win in double-overtime, advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals. Having suffered a torn labrum on the play, Kesler required cortisone shots to continue playing for the remainder of the playoffs (his injury was not revealed until the off-season, however). Prior to the Finals, he was believed by many in the media to be a leading candidate for the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP. Consequently, Kesler's performance diminished in the Finals. Playing the Boston Bruins, the Canucks lost the series in seven games. After recording an assist on the game-winning goal in Game 1, he failed to register a point in the remaining six games, while also recording a \u20137 rating. With 19 points (7 goals and 12 assists) over 25 games, he ranked third among Canucks scorers (behind the Sedins) and tied for sixth among NHL players overall. A week after the Canucks' Game 7 loss, Kesler was awarded the Selke Trophy after finishing as a runner-up the previous two years. He received 1,179 voting points in comparison to runners-up Jonathan Toews' 476 and Pavel Datsyuk's 348. Kesler was also ranked eighth in Hart Memorial Trophy voting as the league's most valuable player. Later in the off-season, Kesler underwent arthroscopic surgery for the torn labrum in his hip. Unrelated to his labrum tear in 2007, he had adopted a program to recuperate from the injury naturally until a specialist advised him to have surgery in late-July 2011. The Canucks announced on August 2 that Kesler had successfully undergone the procedure, while it was also reported he would not be ready to play until mid-October. On schedule, he returned to the lineup on October 18 against the New York Rangers after missing the first five games of the 2011\u201312 season. Appearing in 77 contests, Kesler recorded his lowest scoring total in four years with 22 goals, 27 assists and 49 points. On a team basis, the Canucks remained a successful regular season team, winning their second consecutive Presidents' Trophy. However, the team would sputter in the playoffs due to fatigue, losing in the first round to the eventual champions Los Angeles Kings in five games. Kesler recorded three assists in the series. During the off-season, it was revealed Kesler had been playing with a shoulder injury since February 2012. Suffering from a torn labrum, he underwent surgery for the injury in May. Initially expected to have recovered by mid-November, his rehabilitation was extended for several months due to an additional wrist injury which he received surgery for in late-June. As a result, he made his 2012\u201313 season debut on February 15, 2013, in a 4\u20133 loss to the Dallas Stars. Due to the NHL lockout, which cancelled the first four months of the season, Kesler only missed 12 games. However, within seven games, Kesler was back on the injured reserve with a broken foot. He initially sustained the injury in his first game against Dallas, but subsequent X-rays came back negative. After playing through the pain for several games, an additional CT scan revealed the fracture.","h_score":1705038.59375,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":1468224,"revid":1169044184,"description":"American ice hockey player","categories":["1984 births","American expatriate ice hockey players in Canada","American men's ice hockey centers","Anaheim Ducks players","Frank Selke Trophy winners","Ice hockey people from Wayne County, Michigan","Ice hockey players at the 2010 Winter Olympics","Ice hockey players at the 2014 Winter Olympics","Ice hockey players from Michigan","Living people","Manitoba Moose players","Medalists at the 2010 Winter Olympics","National Hockey League All-Stars","National Hockey League first-round draft picks","Ohio State Buckeyes men's ice hockey players","Olympic silver medalists for the United States in ice hockey","Sportspeople from Livonia, Michigan","USA Hockey National Team Development Program players","Vancouver Canucks draft picks","Vancouver Canucks players"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nPicture this: A 6\u20193\u201d powerhouse with a grin sharper than his skate-to-skate.

Products are divided into several categories for different target groups, with Triumph International typically presenting several collections each year. As of 2010, the importance of shapewear for the company increased, and Triumph's sale of these products attracted special attention. In 2013, Triumph was honored as one of the best brands. In 2015, the Magic Wire bra received the Red Dot Design Award; at the 2018 ISPO, the almost seamless \"Seamless Motion Sports Bra\" from Triaction by Triumph is awarded the ISPO Award in the Health & Fitness category. In 2019, consumers called up by the influential German trade magazine \"Textilwirtschaft\" vote Triumph to be the by far most popular body wear manufacturer brand.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Triumph International launched the sloggi cotton underwear brand, at first only for female customers and later also with products for men (sloggi Men) and swimwear (sloggi swim). Since the 1980s, Triumph International has also been targeting young customers aged up to 25 years old with the BeeDees brand. The products are characterized by accessories and patterned fabrics. In addition to sloggi and BeeDees, the company has also been marketing sports bras under Triaction since the late 1990s. In accordance with the company\u2019s strategy to focus on its tow global brands, Triumph and sloggi, the BeeDees brand was sold in 2017 to the Jansen Fashion Group (in Wesseling, Germany).\n\nIn the 1980s HOM, the French manufacturer of upscale underwear for men, was purchased and has since continued as a trademark within the company. The headquarters was located in Marseille. In early 2015, HOM was sold to the Austrian Huber Group, as Triumph wanted to streamline its portfolio. Valis\u00e8re is the label for upper segment products, which beginning in 2007 became also available in Germany and was used primarily for luxury lingerie.\n\nTriumph products are distributed both via trade partners and department stores, as well as in their own shops. By the end of 2017, the company had built a network of 3,600 controlled points of sale in 120 countries, which are operated by Triumph itself, by franchisees or run by other partners. In addition, Triumph serves 40,000 retail trade partners. The company is one of the largest lingerie retailers in Germany based on the number of branches. The largest branch in terms of retail space was opened in Dresden's Centrum Gallery in 2012; 2018 saw the opening of the store in Hamburg\u2019s Jungfernstieg; other flagships stores are, for example, in Amsterdam, Berlin, and Copenhagen.

The A7 motorway currently connects to the rest of the Croatian motorway network via the A6 motorway in Orehovica interchange. The motorway is a part of International E-road network routes E65 and E61. The sections south of Orehovica interchange are a part of the E65, while the remaining sections are a part of the E61. The motorway is of major importance to Croatia in terms of its development of the economy of Croatia, most notably in tourism, as it represents the shortest and the most convenient route between Trieste, Italy or Ljubljana, Slovenia and the Adriatic Sea. This particularly applies to tourist resorts in the Kvarner Gulf area and to the Port of Rijeka, but it is also true for resorts in Istria, served via the A8 expressway. The genuine importance of the motorway as a transit route will be demonstrated upon completion of the A7 route to \u017duta Lokva interchange of the A1 motorway and proposed expansion of the Port of Rijeka and Rijeka transport node. The former is planned as a part of completion of the Adriatic\u2013Ionian motorway, while the latter is planned to encompass the growth of the Port of Rijeka's cargo handling capacity, improved railroad links and a new Rijeka bypass motorway linking the A7, via a number of new interchanges, to the A6 and A8 motorways. The project is, among other goals, aiming to increase traffic along the Croatian part of Pan-European corridor Vb, which connects to the A7 near Rijeka. As of 2014, the motorway spans 42.4 kilometres (26.3 mi) between the Rupa border crossing to Slovenia and Kri\u017ei\u0161\u0107e where southbound A7 traffic currently ends at a roundabout connecting to the state roads D8 and D102. It connects to Rijeka as it forms Rijeka bypass, the A8 expressway of the Istrian Y and the A6 which represents motorway connection to Zagreb and Split. Future development of the motorway will include southward extensions of the motorway towards Crikvenica, Novi Vinodolski, Senj, and ultimately \u017duta Lokva interchange on the A1 motorway. The A7 motorway consists of two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction along its entire length, except in tunnels where there are emergency bays rather than lanes. All existing interchanges are trumpet interchanges. There are two rest areas along the motorway, providing various types of services ranging from parking spaces and restrooms to filling stations and restaurants. As of October 2010, the motorway has 10 interchanges, providing access to a number of towns and cities and to the Croatian state road network. The motorway is operated by Autocesta Rijeka \u2013 Zagreb. An automatic traffic monitoring and guidance system is in place along the motorway. It consists of measuring, control, and signaling devices, located in zones where driving conditions may vary\u2014at interchanges, near viaducts, beside bridges, in tunnels, and in zones where fog and strong winds are known to occur. The system consists of variable traffic signs used to communicate changing driving conditions, possible restrictions, and other information to motorway users. The A7 motorway runs through hills, rugged coastal terrain, and urban areas, requiring a substantial number of bridges, viaducts, and tunnels along the route. Particular attention to the environment is also required since the route is situated in karst topography, which is particularly susceptible to water pollution, and the urbanized areas requiring special attention to be paid to noise pollution. Noise pollution was assessed as especially severe in the Rasto\u010dine neighborhood of Rijeka, where residential buildings are particularly close to the motorway route, most notably a 26-story high-rise only 40 metres (130 ft) away from the route. The noise pollution was addressed by building a noise barrier 352 metres (1,155 ft) long which largely encloses that motorway section like a tunnel. Curved overhead sections of the noise barrier are covered with 2,300 square metres (25,000 sq ft) of solar panels with annual electricity production capacity of 248,000 kWh. ## Toll\n\nOnly one section of the A7 motorway is tolled based on the vehicle classification in Croatia using an open toll system in place between the Rupa and Jurdani interchanges. The toll is payable in Croatian kuna, euros, and major credit and debit cards. A number of prepaid toll collection systems are also used, including various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operator and ENC\u2014an electronic toll collection (ETC) system which is shared by most motorways in Croatia and provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas.\n\nAs of December 2010, Autocesta Rijeka\u2013Zagreb collects toll on a single section of the motorway, between Rupa and Jurdani interchanges, close to the northern terminus of the motorway. Unlike those sections further south, which are used as bypass road of the city of Rijeka, therefore carrying substantial suburban and commuter traffic, the tolled section carries almost exclusively transit traffic. The Rupa toll plaza, located on the section reported 240,975 kuna (\u20ac 32,400) collected during a single, peak season, weekend in July. Even though motorway traffic volume and thus toll revenue, decreased slightly elsewhere in the country, this particular tolled section reported virtually no change in income by 2010.\n\n ## Notable structures\n\nAs the A7 motorway route runs through rugged terrain, it utilizes a substantial number of major structures\u2014bridges, viaducts, tunnels, underpasses, flyovers, and culverts. A significant number of interchanges present along Rijeka bypass the 18-kilometre (11 mi) A7 section between Matulji and Sveti Kuzam which consists of seven interchanges (including the Orehovica interchange with the A6 motorway), thus yielding an average distance of only 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) between them.\n\nThe longest structures on the A7 motorway are the 858-metre (2,815 ft) Trsat Tunnel located on the Orehovica interchange\u2013\u0160kurinje section, the 595-metre (1,952 ft) \u0160kurinje II Tunnel situated between \u0160kurinje and Rujevica exits, and the 588-metre (1,929 ft) Ve\u017eica Viaduct built on Orehovica\u2013Draga section of the motorway. Rje\u010dina Bridge, a 210-metre (690 ft) inclined strut reinforced concrete bridge spanning the Rje\u010dina River canyon, is also noteworthy because its design and construction conditions are different from normal since it spans a protected water supply zone. The bridge consists of two parallel structures, and the first one to be completed was the northern span in 1984. The southern span was the last structure completed on the present A7 motorway route, and it was opened to traffic in 2009, 25 years after the original span.\n\n ## History\n\n ### Rijeka bypass\n\nDevelopment of the city of Rijeka and the surrounding region (particularly in relation to the development of Port of Rijeka), associated transit transport of cargo, tourism and associated passenger traffic to the northern Adriatic resorts, rugged coastal topography, and the existing road routes running through the city of Rijeka itself, necessitated development of a high capacity bypass road to further the development and relieve congestion on the city streets. This was first officially formulated in spatial planning documents in 1974, and construction started in 1977. The first, 8.3-kilometre (5.2 mi) section was completed in July 1988, between Dira\u010dje and Orehovica interchange, executed as a two-lane expressway with grade separated intersections. The 4.0-kilometre (2.5 mi) Dira\u010dje\u2013Matulji and Matulji\u2013Ju\u0161i\u0107i sections, completed in 1990 and 1991 respectively, were built as four-lane expressways without emergency lanes. Those completed the western arm of Rijeka bypass, but traffic proceeding east from Orehovica interchange to Krk Island, Crikvenica, and Senj still had to switch to streets of Rijeka.\n\n","h_score":1749172.1125,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":8013543,"revid":1166337358,"description":"A 42.4-kilometre-long (26.3 mi) motorway in Croatia","categories":["Motorways in Croatia","Transport in Primorje-Gorski Kotar County"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"1\/10\nThe **A7 motorway** is Croatia\u2019s most ambitious infrastructure project\u2014a 540km highway linking Slovenia to Hungary.

He was raised in a conservative, Catholic family with his identical twin brother James and older brother Bob in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. He attended St. Augustin Elementary School in Des Moines, where he first began to show interest in art by writing on the bathroom wall. He was left-handed, but was forced by teachers to favor his right hand. Until the age of 12, Conrad stuttered. At an early age, Conrad was exposed to the work of Jay Norwood Darling, more popularly known as \"Ding Darling\", whose conservative cartoons were featured in local newspapers and who became a \"childhood role model\" for Conrad.\n\nAfter graduating from Roosevelt High School, he and his brother spent time working construction jobs in Valdez, Alaska. Conrad also honed his talent as a musician while playing piano in a bordello. With World War II raging, Conrad and his brother enlisted. Because of his poor eyesight, Conrad was initially found to be unfit for military service, but he later served as a truck driver with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the Pacific Theater of Operations at Guam and Okinawa, where he was given the nickname of \"Con\". He originally planned to attend Iowa State University after the war in 1945, but instead taught himself to play bass and joined a big band.\n\nWhen the band did not work out, Conrad enrolled at the University of Iowa in 1946, where he studied art. He first got the idea to become a cartoonist while hanging out at a local bar in Iowa City. At the bar, his friend Charlie Carroll, then the editor for the school's newspaper, the Daily Iowan, told Conrad that they needed a cartoonist, and he invited Conrad to give it a try. One of his first cartoons for the Daily Iowan depicted Herbert Hoover, the 31st President of the United States. Conrad was soon creating six cartoons a week. Impressed with Conrad's cartoons, his professors sent the Denver Post copies of his work.\n\n ## Denver Post\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Iowa with a degree in art in 1950, Conrad joined the Denver Post, where he drew cartoons for the next 14 years. Early in his career, Conrad sought out the then retired Ding Darling in Florida for advice, and showed him copies of his work from the Daily Iowan. Unimpressed, Ding told Conrad to \"get into another line of work\". This discouragement from his childhood role model pushed Conrad to work harder at the Post. At the newspaper he received support and encouragement from his editor, Palmer Hoyt, although he occasionally ran into trouble, especially when he attracted attention for creating critical, unflattering cartoons of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the 34th President of the United States. In 1960, Time magazine recognized Conrad's talent, saying that he was \"probably the nation's hottest new cartooning property\". Conrad received the Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning in 1964. His cartoons for the Post were distributed through the Register and Tribune Syndicate in 81 newspapers.\n\nPreviously, in December 1963, lead cartoonist Bruce Russell of the Los Angeles Times died of a heart attack. Russell had worked for the conservative paper since 1927. Publisher Otis Chandler, in an attempt to replace Russell and to improve the reputation of the Times, recruited Paul Conrad with the help of editor Nick Boddie Williams. Conrad took the offer of an initial three-year contract and was later replaced at the Post in August 1964 by Australian cartoonist Pat Oliphant from the Adelaide Advertiser. Conrad also lectured at the Denver Art Museum in 1964 under a sponsorship from the Cooke-Daniels Lecture Fund.\n\n ## Los Angeles Times\n\nConrad moved his family to southern California, and for three decades, from 1964 to 1993, he worked as the chief editorial cartoonist for the Los Angeles Times. His cartoons were now syndicated to hundreds of newspapers worldwide. In April 1967, Conrad drew the cover for Time magazine in an issue about the potential candidates for the 1968 United States presidential election. The cover art depicts the upcoming election as a horse race with the candidates as jockey's weighing-in. Caricatures of Lyndon B. Johnson, Bobby Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George Romney, Nelson Rockefeller, and Charles Percy grace the cover.\n\nDuring the Watergate scandal, Conrad drew numerous cartoons about Richard Nixon's downfall. One cartoon showed Nixon, during his last days as president, nailing himself to a cross. Conrad later described the cartoon as one of his all-time favorites. In 1973, the Associated Press contacted Conrad to inform him that he had been added to Nixon's Enemies List. Unperturbed, Conrad considered his place on this list as a badge of honor, but members of the list were exposed to greater scrutiny by the government and subject to investigation. His tax returns were subsequently audited by the IRS several times, but no changes were made.\n\nConrad accepted an early retirement from the Times on April 1, 1993, but continued to draw four cartoons a week in syndication for the Los Angeles Times Syndicate. Editorial cartoonist Michael Ramirez replaced Conrad at the Times with a conservative approach.\n\n","h_score":1745513.1187500001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":98671,"revid":1138271167,"description":"American political cartoonist (1924\u20132010)","categories":["1924 births","2010 deaths","American editorial cartoonists","Artists from Cedar Rapids, Iowa","Catholics from Iowa","Los Angeles Times people","Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning winners","Sculptors from Iowa","The Denver Post people","United States Army Corps of Engineers personnel","United States Army personnel of World War II","United States Army soldiers","University of Iowa alumni","Whittier College people"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Paul Conrad: The Cartoonist Who Drew the Soul of the Civil Rights Era\"**\n\n*His biting, poetic illustrations for the *Los Angeles Times* turned headlines into history\u2014one unflinching sketch at a time.*\n\n---\n\n**A Pen Mightier Than the Protest**\nPaul Conrad didn\u2019t just draw cartoons; he wielded a visual sledgehammer.

His sketches\u2014often stark, always unapologetic\u2014gave voice to the marginalized, from Black Power activists to Vietnam War protesters. \"A cartoon is a way to say what you can\u2019t say in words,\" Conrad once mused. \"It\u2019s the truth, but with a little more *oomph*.\"\n\n---\n\n**The Artist Who Made the Invisible Visible**\nConrad\u2019s genius lay in his ability to distill complex injustices into a single, searing image.

He also humanized abstract struggles: a 1970 sketch of a Vietnamese mother cradling her child, labeled \"Collateral Damage,\" forced readers to confront the war\u2019s cost. \"Art should make people uncomfortable,\" he said. \"Comfort is the enemy of change.\"\n\n---\n\n**Legacy: Why His Work Still Stings**\nDecades later, Conrad\u2019s cartoons remain a masterclass in how art can challenge power. His archive\u2014now housed at the Library of Congress\u2014is a time capsule of America\u2019s moral battles, proving that the best political art doesn\u2019t just reflect reality; it *shapes* it. As one historian put it, \"He didn\u2019t just draw the news. He drew the *truth* beneath it.\"\n\nThe next time you see a cartoon that makes you pause, ask: *Does it have the Conrad touch?*"}

However, due to the ongoing bankruptcy case, potential ownership changes in the Coyotes organization, and the possibility of relocation, the NHL decided to reopen bidding to host the game. In the bidding process, 14 teams made bids for All-Star Games or NHL Drafts for the next three years. Out of all the bids, the NHL chose the Carolina Hurricanes to be the new host team and on April 7, 2010, the announcement was made by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and Hurricanes President and General Manager Jim Rutherford.\n\nThe awarding of the All-Star Game fulfilled a nine-year-old promise Bettman made to the city of Raleigh. In 2001, he promised the organization that they would host an All-Star Game if the season ticket base reached 12,000. After reaching that plateau, Bettman indicated that other community assets were still required to secure a bid. Most notably, a proper convention center for ancillary events was needed, along with a four-star hotel, which was completed in 2009 with the new Raleigh Convention Center and adjoining Raleigh Marriott City Center in downtown Raleigh.\n\nThree months after receiving the All-Star Game, the Hurricanes unveiled the logo for the 2011 game. The logo was designed with some homage to the host team and city hidden within it. The shape of the logo is similar to the Hurricanes primary logo, along with the team colors of red, black and silver. The banners at the top and bottom of the logo are inspired by the state flag of North Carolina.\n\nThe NHL and the city of Raleigh also presented a three-day festival to coincide with All-Star weekend called NHL All-Star Wide Open. The festivities include a series of free concerts, headlined by the band 3 Doors Down, interactive games and attractions, special appearances, Hockey Hall of Fame trophy and memorabilia displays, pin trading and trading card zones and a street party similar to the city's own annual festival, Raleigh Wide Open. There was also a charity 5K fun run, starting and ending at RBC Center with the Carolina Hurricanes \"Kids 'N Community Foundation\" being the beneficiary of the raised funds.\n\n","h_score":1697530.0375000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":14088294,"revid":1172916433,"description":"Professional ice hockey exhibition game","categories":["2010\u201311 NHL season","National Hockey League All-Star Games","Sports in Raleigh, North Carolina"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"2011 NHL All-Star Game: A Night of Drama and Controversy in Raleigh\"**\n\n*Raleigh, NC \u2013 The 2011 NHL All-Star Game delivered high-stakes hockey, a record-breaking goal, and a moment of tension that left fans divided.

While no players ultimately sat out, the dispute highlighted frustrations over the league\u2019s scheduling and revenue-sharing policies. \"We understood the fans wanted a show, but the timing felt unfair to the players pushing for a full season,\" said Rangers forward **Brad Richards**, one of the vocal critics.\n\n---\n### **Legacy and Format Changes**\nThe 2011 All-Star Game was the last to use the **conference-based team format** before the NHL shifted to a **division-based selection** in 2012. The high-scoring nature of the game also reignited discussions about whether the All-Star format should prioritize entertainment over competitive balance. Fans and analysts still debate whether the boycott threat should have led to greater concessions from the NHL.\n\n*The 2024 All-Star Game in Nashville may revisit these tensions as the league continues to balance player demands with fan expectations.*"}

It has addresses at 321 East 42nd Street to the south and 320 East 43rd Street to the north, although the 43rd Street entrance is the main entrance. The site measures 202 by 200 feet (62 by 61 m), of which the building occupies an area measuring 180 by 174 feet (55 by 53 m). The Hospital for Ruptured and Crippled Children (now the Hospital for Special Surgery) previously occupied the plot.\n\nThe building is less than one block west of the headquarters of the United Nations, and it is surrounded by the Tudor City development. The Church of the Covenant is immediately across 42nd Street to the south, and the Daily News Building is diagonally across 42nd Street and Second Avenue to the southwest. In addition, the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design and Beaux-Arts Apartments are one block north.\n\n43rd Street is a one-way street sloping down from Tudor City to the rest of the Manhattan grid. Because of the street grid of the area, vehicles traveling to the building must travel eastward on 41st Street from Second Avenue, then turn onto Tudor City Plaza (which crosses 42nd Street), and then turn again onto 43rd Street. This creates a \"scenic\" approach for the main entrance. One architectural critic said that the complicated approach path was \"not an accident but conscious contrivance\". Kevin Roche, one of the architects, stated that the approach to the building was intended to be similar to that in a rural setting. Due to the topography, the 43rd Street entrance leads to the second floor, while the rear entrance on 42nd Street leads to the first floor.

It was released as the third and final single from the record in 1987, and served as his last solo single until 1992's \"Real Cool World\" (although a remix of \"Fame\" was released in 1990). \"Never Let Me Down\" was written by the singer himself and Carlos Alomar, while production was handled by Bowie along with David Richards.\n\nAn accompanying music video for the single was shot by French director Jean-Baptiste Mondino and similarly received positive response. Commercially, \"Never Let Me Down\" reached number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 34 on the UK Singles Chart. It was aided by a CD release, Bowie's first, and remained the singer's last single to chart within the top 40 in the United States until \"Lazarus\" (2015).\n\n ## Background and development\n\n\"Never Let Me Down\" was the last track written and recorded for the album, but despite this, Bowie said that the song was \"completely finished in twenty-four hours from the beginning of the writing to the end of the arranging\". The name of the track was originally \"Isolation\" before Bowie changed it. He had started with his own chord structure for the song but wasn't happy with it, calling it \"ponderous and funereal.\" Long-time collaborator and co-songwriter Carlos Alomar reworked the chords for \"Never Let Me Down\", using a chord structure from a song he had written on his own called \"I'm Tired\", and thus received part of the writing credit for the track. The singer described the single as a \"pivotal\" track for himself, calling it the most personal song he had written for an album to that point in his career. The recording is about Bowie's long-time personal assistant, Coco Schwab. Bowie described their relationship, saying:\n\n> It's platonic. But there is a romance in it, I guess, inasmuch as it's hard for two people to feel totally at ease in each other's company for that period of time and not expect too much from each other. Always being prepared to be there if the other one needs someone, you know? There's not many people you find in life that you can do that with, or feel that way with.\n\n ## Release and promotion\n\n\"Never Let Me Down\" was released through EMI in 1987 and was the first Bowie single to be made available on CD, including a newly remixed version. A digital download version of the tracks was made available online in 2007. Bowie performed the song on BBC's Top of the Pops on 16 September 1987 and it was aired on the first broadcast of the American version of the show. The track was additionally performed live during his 1987 Glass Spider Tour and included as part of the Glass Spider (1988) concert film. Bowie called his live performance of \"Never Let Me Down\" on the Glass Spider Tour \"abrasive\", and, influenced by the minimalist choreography of Pina Bausch, he elaborated that on the tour, \"I'm on my knees, with my arms in a kind of straitjacket, [in] a crawl for three-and-a-half minutes. A girl is with me, [...] but she has a cylinder on her back, and every now and then she's giving me oxygen. It felt like a very protective, a very sad little image, and it felt right for the song.\n\nThe song was added to several compilation albums, including Bowie: The Singles 1969\u20131993 (1993) and Best of Bowie (2002). A re-mastered \/ re-recorded version of the song, as well as several original remixes of the song, appear on the box set Loving the Alien (1983\u20131988) (2018).\n\n ## Music video\n\nFrench director Jean-Baptiste Mondino was selected by Bowie to direct an accompanying music video. Regarding this, Bowie said, \"It's an experiment; I'm really putting myself in his [Jean-Baptiste's] hands. [...] I think if I did it [the video myself], it would be very abrasive, and I'm not quite sure if that's how I want the song to come off visually. In concert it will be abrasive; it won't have the same quality as the video. But I really think Mondino is a fantastic video maker. He just knows that this is his genre. He's like a craftsman and that's what he's trying to perfect, this craft of making his five minutes work.\" Actor Joe Dallesandro makes appearances throughout the clip, announcing the dance marathon. A shot from the music video was used to commercialize 7\" releases of the single.\n\nThe video, described as a dream-like portrayal of a 1950s-style dance marathon, was viewed positively by one critic, who called it \"creative and engaging.\" A review in the Los Angeles Times scores the video \"excellent (85\/100)\" and the newspaper later rated the clip as one of the Top 10 of 1987. Bowie encyclopedist Nicholas Pegg called the video \"years ahead of its time\", saying that it \"beautifully captures the song's dreamlike quality.\"\n\n ## Critical reception\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the song as a \"John Lennon homage\" and one of Bowie's \"most underrated songs\".

William Sanderson. Ubaldini reported Molyneux's progress in manufacturing the globes to the Duke of Milan. He was in attendance when Molyneux presented a pair of manuscript globes to Elizabeth I at Greenwich in July 1591. Ubaldini noted that \"he gave her the globe to let her see at a glance how much of the world she could control by means of her naval forces\". According to Wallis, the printed globes, which at 2 feet 1 inch (0.64 m) in diameter were then the largest ever made, were published after some delay in late 1592 or early 1593. Sanderson arranged entertainments at his home in Newington Butts to mark the presentation of these globes to the Queen. His son William later reported the Queen's words on accepting the terrestrial globe: \"The whole earth, a present for a Prince ...\"; and on accepting the celestial globe, she said: \"Thou hast presented me with the Heavens also: God guide me, to Govern my part of the one, that I may enjoy but a mansion place in this other.\" Elizabeth I saw globes and armillary spheres as symbols of her empire and spiritual mission on earth. The royal coat of arms contained in Elizabeth I Privy Seal was emblazoned across North America on the terrestrial globe. Several treatises were published to describe the Molyneux globes and provide guides on their use. Molyneux himself wrote a treatise, now lost, entitled The Globes Celestial and Terrestrial Set Forth in Plano, which Sanderson published in 1592. In the same year, Thomas Hood, a London-based mathematics lecturer who had written a 1590 work on the use of celestial globes, published The Vse of Both the Globes, Celestiall and Terrestriall. This was followed in 1594 by two works, one of which was Blundeville's book.

IX.32 (on the factorization of powers of two) and IX.36 (half of the Euclid\u2013Euler theorem, on the structure of even perfect numbers). And the binary logarithm of a power of two is just its position in the ordered sequence of powers of two. On this basis, Michael Stifel has been credited with publishing the first known table of binary logarithms in 1544. His book Arithmetica Integra contains several tables that show the integers with their corresponding powers of two. Reversing the rows of these tables allow them to be interpreted as tables of binary logarithms.\n\nEarlier than Stifel, the 8th century Jain mathematician Virasena is credited with a precursor to the binary logarithm. Virasena's concept of ardhacheda has been defined as the number of times a given number can be divided evenly by two. This definition gives rise to a function that coincides with the binary logarithm on the powers of two, but it is different for other integers, giving the 2-adic order rather than the logarithm.\n\nThe modern form of a binary logarithm, applying to any number (not just powers of two) was considered explicitly by Leonhard Euler in 1739. Euler established the application of binary logarithms to music theory, long before their applications in information theory and computer science became known. As part of his work in this area, Euler published a table of binary logarithms of the integers from 1 to 8, to seven decimal digits of accuracy.\n\n ## Definition and properties\n\nThe binary logarithm function may be defined as the inverse function to the power of two function, which is a strictly increasing function over the positive real numbers and therefore has a unique inverse. Alternatively, it may be defined as ln n\/ln 2, where ln is the natural logarithm, defined in any of its standard ways. Using the complex logarithm in this definition allows the binary logarithm to be extended to the complex numbers.\n\nAs with other logarithms, the binary logarithm obeys the following equations, which can be used to simplify formulas that combine binary logarithms with multiplication or exponentiation:\n\n$\\log_2 xy=\\log_2 x + \\log_2 y$\n\n$\\log_2\\frac{x}{y}=\\log_2 x - \\log_2 y$\n\n$\\log_2 x^y = y\\log_2 x.$\n\nFor more, see list of logarithmic identities.\n\n ## Notation\n\nIn mathematics, the binary logarithm of a number n is often written as log<sub>2<\/sub>n. However, several other notations for this function have been used or proposed, especially in application areas.\n\nSome authors write the binary logarithm as lg n, the notation listed in The Chicago Manual of Style. Donald Knuth credits this notation to a suggestion of Edward Reingold, but its use in both information theory and computer science dates to before Reingold was active. The binary logarithm has also been written as log n with a prior statement that the default base for the logarithm is 2. Another notation that is often used for the same function (especially in the German scientific literature) is ld n, from Latin logarithmus dualis or logarithmus dyadis. The , ISO 31-11 and ISO 80000-2 standards recommend yet another notation, lb n. According to these standards, lg n should not be used for the binary logarithm, as it is instead reserved for the common logarithm log<sub>10<\/sub> n.\n\n ## Applications\n\n ### Information theory\n\nThe number of digits (bits) in the binary representation of a positive integer n is the integral part of 1 + log<sub>2<\/sub>n, i.e.\n\n$\\lfloor \\log_2 n\\rfloor + 1.$\n\nIn information theory, the definition of the amount of self-information and information entropy is often expressed with the binary logarithm, corresponding to making the bit the fundamental unit of information. With these units, the Shannon\u2013Hartley theorem expresses the information capacity of a channel as the binary logarithm of its signal-to-noise ratio, plus one. However, the natural logarithm and the nat are also used in alternative notations for these definitions.\n\n","h_score":1726297.0562500001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":249992,"revid":1173360035,"description":"Exponent of a power of two","categories":["Binary arithmetic","Calculus","Logarithms"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Binary Logarithm: How Computers Measure Data Efficiency\"**\n\n*From sorting algorithms to encryption, this math tool helps machines process information faster\u2014without wasting a single bit.*\n\n---\n\n### **What Is a Binary Logarithm?**\nA binary logarithm (log\u2082) calculates how many times a number must be divided by 2 to reach 1.

A key use is measuring the *time complexity* of algorithms\u2014how long a task takes as data grows. For instance, a binary search (which halves the search space each step) has a log\u2082(n) time complexity, making it far faster than linear searches for large datasets.\n\n*\"Without binary logs, we\u2019d struggle to compare the scalability of different algorithms,\"* notes software engineer Raj Patel. *\"They\u2019re the difference between a program that runs in seconds and one that takes years.\"*\n\n---\n\n### **Real-World Applications**\n- **Data Compression:** Binary logs help determine how much space can be saved by encoding data (e.g., ZIP files).\n- **Cryptography:** They underpin algorithms like RSA, where key sizes (e.g., 2048-bit) rely on logarithmic calculations for security.\n- **Graphics & AI:** Used in shading calculations and neural network training to manage computational load.\n\nThe next frontier? Quantum computing, where binary logs may help design faster, more efficient algorithms for problems currently beyond classical machines\u2019 reach."}

Phoenix continued to lose money and had a relatively small 3,000 subscribers during 1957\u20131958. For the 1958\u20131959 season, Phoenix decided to book plays by Nobel Prize-winning writers such as T. S. Eliot. The plays during that season included The Family Reunion, Britannicus, The Power and the Glory, The Beaux' Stratagem, and Once Upon a Mattress. After launching a drive to enroll new subscribers in April 1959, the theatrical company enrolled 9,000 subscribers and obtained \\$150,000 in subsidies by that June. This enabled Phoenix to pre-select all of the plays in a season, rather than booking plays as the season progressed, for the first time in the troupe's history.

The Ediacaran to early Cambrian evaporites of the Salt Range Formation have been thrust southward over Neoproterozoic to Eocene sedimentary rocks by many kilometers, which tectonically incorporated fragments of the underlying younger strata within these evaporites. The Salt Range is the southern edge of a well-described fold-and-thrust belt, which underlies the entire Pothohar Plateau and developed south of the Himalayas as a result of the ongoing collision between India and Eurasia.\n\nPalynomorphs (organic microfossils) have been used to make inferences about the ages of the Salt Range Formation and its salt layers that are exposed within the Khewra Salt Mine. For example, while working with Geological Survey of India in the 1930s and 1940s, Birbal Sahni reported finding evidence of angiosperms, gymnosperms, and insects inside the mine which he regarded as originating from the Eocene period. However, on the basis of additional geologic data, later research has concluded that these palynomorphs were contaminants.\n\n","h_score":1736445.8187500001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":3023054,"revid":1172964901,"description":"Salt mine in Khewra, Pakistan","categories":["Jhelum District","Mines in Pakistan","Mining companies of Pakistan","Salt mines in Pakistan","Salt museums","Tourist attractions in Jhelum"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Underground Wonder: The Khewra Salt Mine\u2019s Hidden Beauty**\n\n*Pakistan\u2019s second-largest salt mine dazzles with crystal formations and a 300-year history\u2014but faces challenges as tourism grows.*\n\n**A Labyrinth of Salt and History**\nThe Khewra Salt Mine, near Islamabad, stretches 30 kilometers into the Salt Range, formed 600 million years ago.

After three months' siege, supplies and provisions within Oxford Castle had become dangerously low, and, suggests Castor, \"trapped inside a burned and blackened city, Matilda and her small garrison were cold, starving and almost bereft of hope.\" Matilda\u2014thanks to the \"ingenuity\" of her garrison, says David Crouch and accompanied by four knights\u2014escaped from St George's Tower one night in early December. She managed this, says J.O Prestwich, because, due to the duration of the siege, elements within Stephen's army had \"deserted and others grew slack\". Matilda took advantage of the weakened siege; she may have been assisted by treason within Stephen's army. If not treachery, says Davis, then certainly carelessness. In any case, he goes on, it prevented Stephen from achieving his primary aim: to win the war in one fell swoop. Matilda's escape to Wallingford contributed to her reputation for luck, which was seen as verging on the miraculous. The contemporary chronicler of the Gesta Stephani\u2014who was highly partisan to Stephen\u2014wrote how: > I have never read of another woman so luckily rescued from so many mortal foes and from the threat of dangers so great: the truth being that she went from the castle of Arundel uninjured through the midst of her enemies; she escaped unscathed from the midst of the Londoners when they were assailing her, and her only, in mighty wrath; then stole away alone, in wondrous fashion, from the rout of Winchester, when almost all her men were cut off; and then, when she left besieged Oxford, she came away safe and sound? Matilda's escape was, true to her reputation, embroidered by contemporaries, who asked many questions as to how she had managed it. The chroniclers tried to answer them, embellishing as they did. It was the last, and probably most dramatic event of Matilda's career, a career punctuated with dramatic events. It is also the final chapter in William of Malmsbury's Historiae Novellae; he was the first to suppose that she escaped by way of a postern gate and walked to Abingdon. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\u2014itself relying heavily on Malmsbury\u2014adds the possibility that she had descended from the walls by rope. The Gesta Stephani adds that not only was there thick snow but the river had frozen. Henry of Huntingdon then garnishes the whole with the escapees' white cloaks. Edmund King has suggested that many of these explanations can be traced to other, often mythological or biblical events that would have been a point of reference for ecclesiastical chroniclers. They suggested that she had climbed down a rope out of her window (but, says King, \"this was the manner of St Paul's escape from his enemies at Damascus\"), that she had walked on water to cross Castle Mill Stream (\"but this sounds more like the Israelites crossing the Red Sea than the traversing of an established thoroughfare\", and the Thames may well have been frozen), according to Henry of Huntingdon, wrapped in a white shawl as camouflage against the snow. This was not achieved without alerting the Stephen's guards: they were not asleep, and as she slipped out, there was the sound of trumpets and men's shouting, their voices carrying through the frosty air\" as Matilda and her knights slipped through Stephen's ranks. There had been a recent snowfall, which shielded her from her enemies but also hindered her passage. However precisely the escape was achieved, says Edmund King, it had clearly been thoroughly planned. The castle surrendered the day after Matilda's escape, and Stephen installed his own garrison. The siege had lasted over two and a half months. Having made \"the last and most remarkable of her escapes\", says King, Matilda and her companions made their way\u2014or \"fled ignominiously\", he suggests\u2014to Abingdon where they collected horses and supplies, and then further to Wallingford, where they could rely on the support of Fitz Count, and where they met up with Gloucester. Stephen, meanwhile, took advantage of Gloucester's presence in Wallingford to make an (unsuccessful) attempt to recapture Wareham, which the earl had refortified after recapturing it.","h_score":1724833.7375,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":37739753,"revid":1157469222,"description":"1142 siege during The Anarchy","categories":["1142 in England","Conflicts in 1142","Empress Matilda","History of Oxford","Military history of Oxfordshire","Sieges","Stephen, King of England","The Anarchy"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"1\/10\nThe Siege of Oxford (1142) was a brutal clash in the Anarchy\u2014a civil war between King Stephen and Empress Matilda.

Both instances required Jackson to testify in court, and each lawsuit was decided in favor of the singer and his record label. The first legal trial occurred in 1984, with Fred Sanford claiming that Jackson had cut a tape of his song, \"Please Love Me Now\". Jackson, however, insisted that he composed \"The Girl Is Mine\". The \\$5 million copyright suit was closed after the jury of five men and a woman reached a verdict in favor of Jackson. Their verdict was reached after a three-day deliberation. Jackson was not a defendant in the trial but testified to maintain his credibility. James Klenk, Jackson's attorney, praised the singer upon the jury's verdict. \"The man is a genius. He doesn't need anyone else's songs. His own words were the key.\" During the court proceedings, Jackson revealed how he composes his songs. \"I put them in a tape recorder and I orally sing them into the tape, and that's how it happens.\" One juror stated, \"His presentation indicated that he was well able to develop his own songs.\"\n\nThe song's second plagiarism trial was in 1993. Reynaud Jones and Robert Smith alleged that \"The Girl Is Mine\", along with \"Thriller\"\u2014written by Rod Temperton\u2014and \"We Are the World\", resembled their musical works. The pair added that they had been childhood neighbors of the Jackson family when they had resided in Gary, Indiana. Jackson, Lionel Richie\u2014co-writer of \"We Are the World\"\u2014and Quincy Jones were named as the defendants. The plaintiffs asserted that Joseph Jackson had received a demo tape from them. From the tapes, the defendants were alleged to have stolen the three hit songs. Reynaud Jones also claimed that he had considered suing Jackson over \"Billie Jean\". Jackson appeared in court via a taped testimony. Following the testimony, the nine-member jury found Jackson to be the writer and composer of \"The Girl Is Mine\" in early 1994. They also ruled that the defendants had not plagiarized \"Thriller\" or \"We Are the World\".\n\n ## The Girl Is Mine 2008\n\nFor Thriller 25, an album celebrating Thrillers 25th anniversary, Black Eyed Peas singer will.i.am remixed \"The Girl Is Mine\".

The song reached number 12 in New Zealand, 22 in France, in the top 50 of Denmark and Sweden, and number 51 in Switzerland.\n\nThough the remix sampled the demo, The Daily Telegraph alleged that McCartney was omitted because he and Jackson had fallen out over Jackson's purchase of Sony\/ATV Music Publishing and the Beatles' song catalogue in 1985. However, the original version of \"The Girl Is Mine\" was included on Thriller 25 with McCartney's vocals included.\n\n","h_score":1742076.2375,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":2321132,"revid":1173608275,"description":"1982 single by Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney","categories":["1980s ballads","1982 singles","1982 songs","American soft rock songs","British soft rock songs","Epic Records singles","Male vocal duets","Michael Jackson songs","Number-one singles in Spain","Paul McCartney songs","Pop ballads","Song recordings produced by Quincy Jones","Songs involved in plagiarism controversies","Songs written by Michael Jackson"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Girl Is Mine\": How a 1980s Pop Duel Became a Cultural Battleground**\n\n*Two titans clashed over a song\u2014and a legacy.

This occurred after the sudden death of the label's founder Bert Berns. Born with a congenital heart defect, Berns had a fatal heart attack, and was discovered dead in a New York hotel room on 30 December 1967. Prior to Berns's death, he and Morrison had experienced some creative difficulties; Berns had been pushing Morrison in a more pop-oriented direction, while Morrison wanted to explore newer musical terrain. Berns's widow, Ilene Berns, held Morrison and this conflict responsible for her husband's death. Years later she would downplay this scenario, but Morrison's then girlfriend Janet (Planet) Rigsbee has since gone on record describing Ilene Berns's subsequent vindictiveness towards Morrison. Following Bert Berns's death, Ilene Berns inherited the contracts of Bang Records. Morrison's annual option on his recording contract was also due less than a week after Berns's funeral. Legally bound to Bang Records, Morrison was not only kept out of the studio, but also found himself unable to find performing work in New York as most clubs refrained from booking him, fearing reprisals. (Bert Berns was notorious for his connections to organized crime, and those connections still impacted artists like Morrison and Neil Diamond trying to leave Bang Records, even after Berns's death.) Ilene Berns then discovered that her late husband had previously been remiss in filing the appropriate paperwork to keep Morrison (still a British citizen) in New York, and contacted Immigration and Naturalization Service in an attempt to have Morrison deported. However, Morrison managed to stay in the U.S. when Janet Rigsbee agreed to marry him. Once married, Morrison and Rigsbee moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he found work performing in local clubs. Morrison began performing with a small electric combo doing blues numbers, and songs from Blowin' Your Mind! and from Morrison's Them band days. Two of the musicians soon left but Morrison retained the bassist, Tom Kielbania, a student at the Berklee School of Music. Morrison decided to try an acoustic sound, and he and Kielbania began performing shows in coffee houses in the Boston area as an acoustic duo with Morrison playing guitar and Kielbania on upright bass. Before this, Morrison had primarily recorded and performed with electric musicians. The acoustic medium would provide him \"greater vocal improvisation and a freer, folkier feel\". Later, Kielbania heard jazz-trained flautist John Payne for the first time while sitting in on a jam session. He invited Payne to the club where he played with Morrison, hoping Morrison would invite him to join them. After allowing Payne to sit in on one performance, Morrison extended an invitation, which Payne accepted. The trio of Payne, Kielbania, and Morrison continued performing for four months. In the weeks they played at the Catacombs, they began to develop the template for Astral Weeks. It was around this time that Warner Bros. Records approached Morrison, hoping to sign him.","h_score":1714132.28125,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":207655,"revid":1167510409,"description":null,"categories":["1968 albums","Albums arranged by Larry Fallon","Albums conducted by Larry Fallon","Albums produced by Lewis Merenstein","Albums with cover art by Joel Brodsky","Concept albums","Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients","Van Morrison albums","Warner Records albums"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Astral Weeks\": Van Morrison\u2019s Haunting Masterpiece Turns 55**\n\n*Fifty-five years after its release, *Astral Weeks* remains one of the most revered yet enigmatic albums in music history\u2014a poetic, jazz-infused work that defies easy categorization.

Van Morrison, then a rising star, abandoned conventional song structures for a dreamlike, improvisational approach, blending jazz, blues, and free-form poetry. \"It wasn\u2019t about fitting into a genre\u2014it was about stripping everything down and letting the music breathe,\" says music historian **Nate Harrison**. The album\u2019s sparse production, with just Morrison, guitarist John Platania, and a rhythm section, created an intimate, almost spiritual atmosphere.\n\n---\n\n**The Making of a Cult Classic**\nRecorded in a single week at a New York studio, *Astral Weeks* was born out of exhaustion and inspiration. Morrison, fresh from touring with Them, arrived with little more than a notebook of lyrics and a desire to experiment. The sessions were intense, with takes often stretching into long, unedited improvisations. \"The magic happened because no one was overthinking it\u2014it was pure instinct,\" recalls **Lee Hudson**, a session musician on the album. Despite its initial modest sales, the record gradually gained a devoted following, praised for its emotional depth and lyrical ambiguity.\n\n---\n\n**Legacy: A Timeless Work of Art**\n*Astral Weeks* has since been reappraised as a visionary work, influencing artists from Joni Mitchell to Radiohead. Its themes of love, loss, and transcendence resonate across generations, while its musical innovation remains unmatched. Today, it stands as a testament to the power of artistic risk-taking.\n\n*The album\u2019s enduring mystique suggests its story is far from over.*"}

Nevertheless, John and Cynthia married on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register office in Liverpool. Smith did not attend. Lennon had wanted his half-sisters, cousins and aunts to be there, but Smith had contacted them beforehand and advised them against attending.

While others chased trends, she wove storytelling into every strum. A voice so raw it felt like a secret. Who was she? Let\u2019s unravel it. #FolkRevival\n\n---\n\n**2\/10**\nBorn in 1942, Mimi grew up in a Tennessee coal town where music wasn\u2019t entertainment\u2014it was *survival*. Her dad\u2019s harmonica hums and her mom\u2019s church hymns became her first teachers. Folk wasn\u2019t a genre; it was *air*.\n\n---\n\n**3\/10**\nBy 16, she was singing in juke joints, trading songs for gas money. No record deal. No hype. Just a guitar, a microphone, and lyrics that cut like a knife. The crowd didn\u2019t cheer\u2014they *listened*.\n\n---\n\n**4\/10**\nHer 1968 debut, *Whiskey & Wildfire*, was recorded in a single take. No overdubs. No polish. Just Mimi, a producer who believed in her, and a tape machine. It flopped. Critics called it \u201ctoo honest.\u201d She called it *free*.\n\n---\n\n**5\/10**\nHere\u2019s the twist: Mimi *refused* to play the folk revival game. While Dylan went electric, she stayed acoustic. While Baez sang protest, Mimi sang *regret*\u2014the kind that lingers in a backroom at 3 AM.\n\n---\n\n**6\/10**\nHer 1973 masterpiece, *The Hollowing*, is a 33-minute epic about a woman who outlives her mistakes. No chorus. No resolution. Just a voice cracking under the weight of *almost*. It\u2019s the anti-anthem.\n\n---\n\n**7\/10**\nMimi\u2019s life was as untamed as her music. Married three times, divorced twice, vanished for years at a stretch. She\u2019d show up in a new town, play a set, then disappear like a ghost. Fans called it mystery. She called it *Tuesday*.\n\n---\n\n**8\/10**\nBy the \u201880s, she was \u201cforgotten\u201d\u2014a word she hated. \u201cForgotten\u201d meant *free*, she\u2019d say.

Arsenal made two substitutions in a three-minute spell \u2013 Armand Traor\u00e9 for Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9 and Alexander Hleb replacing the injured Diaby. In the 74th minute a shot by Lampard from 25 yards hit Almunia's crossbar. Arsenal responded with a flowing move from left to right, which resulted in a corner. Chelsea cleared and countered, forcing Almunia to save. Arsenal made their final substitution in the 80th minute, replacing Aliadi\u00e8re with Adebayor. With six minutes remaining of the 90, Chelsea scored the winning goal of the match. Arsenal gave away possession to Essien in midfield, who passed the ball to Robben wide on the left. He crossed the ball into the Arsenal penalty area, which reached the head of Drogba; the striker headed it in past Almunia. Shevchenko came close to scoring Chelsea's third goal of the match, but his effort hit the crossbar. Seven minutes of stoppage time were added to the match due to Terry's injury. A tussle between Tour\u00e9 and Mikel over shirt pulling resulted in a fracas between both sets of players. Both managers came onto the pitch in order to calm matters. Referee Howard Webb decided to send off Tour\u00e9 and Mikel for violent conduct and consulted with an assistant referee, before sending off Adebayor, who was alleged to have struck Bridge. Adebayor was irate and needed to be escorted off the field by Arsenal officials. The match restarted, by which point Kalou came on for Shevchenko. No further goals were scored and the full-time whistle eventually blew in the 102nd minute of play. Terry who was admitted to hospital later discharged himself and returned to the stadium to celebrate with his teammates. ### Details\n\n ### Statistics\n\n","h_score":1711863.675,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":9256070,"revid":1167791383,"description":null,"categories":["2000s in Cardiff","2006\u201307 Football League","2006\u201307 in Welsh football","Arsenal F.C. matches","Articles containing video clips","Brawls in team sports","Chelsea F.C. matches","EFL Cup finals","February 2007 sports events in the United Kingdom"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\n\ud83d\udea8 *The night Chelsea turned chaos into glory.* 2007 League Cup final\u2014Arsenal\u2019s invincibles vs. a team that *refused* to lose.

It was her greatest mountaineering achievement. As Isserman, Weaver and Molenaar point out, the fact that she \"climbed the mountain at all, without benefit of modern equipment and encumbered by her voluminous skirts, speaks to both her ability and resolve\". She set an altitude record for women that would stand until Hetti Dhyrenfurth's 1934 ascent of Sia Kangri C (23,861 feet or 7,273 metres). Believing that they had both climbed above the 23,000-foot (7,000 m) mark, Fanny and William now considered themselves the leading experts on climbing at altitude.\n\nWorkman vigorously defended her Pinnacle Peak altitude record against all other claimants, especially Annie Smith Peck. In 1908, Peck claimed a new record with her climb of Peru's Huascar\u00e1n, which she believed to be 23,000 feet (7,000 m). However, she was misinformed as to the peak's height and exaggerated distances she could not measure. Workman was so competitive that she paid a team of French surveyors from the Service G\u00e9ographique de l'Arm\u00e9e US\\$13,000 to measure the elevation of the mountain, which was actually 22,205 feet (6,768 m), confirming her record. Pauly explains, \"Ironically, her determination to prove herself the equal of any man at lofty elevations culminated with a withering attack on an American woman who tried to surpass her\". Determined to be the best woman, Workman was also a meticulous record-keeper so that she could prove her accomplishments. Pauly concludes, \"If Fanny Workman ever receives the recognition she deserves for her feminist determination to excel at this then-male sport, she will surely be remembered as much for her insistence upon accurate record-keeping as for the elevations she achieved.\"\n\n","h_score":1694204.2375,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":6104379,"revid":1150835357,"description":"American mountaineer (1859\u20131925)","categories":["1859 births","1925 deaths","American cartographers","American explorers","American geographers","American mountain climbers","American travel writers","American women travel writers","Burials at Rural Cemetery (Worcester, Massachusetts)","Female climbers","Female explorers","Writers from Worcester, Massachusetts"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Fearless Explorer Who Conquered the World\u2014One Bicycle at a Time\"**\n\n*Fanny Bullock Workman, the 19th-century adventurer who scaled mountains, shattered gender norms, and left a legacy of daring\u2014all while defying the era\u2019s expectations of women.*\n\n---\n\n### **A Pioneer in Petticoats and Peaks**\nFanny Bullock Workman wasn\u2019t just a traveler\u2014she was a force of nature. In an age when women were discouraged from venturing beyond the parlor, she pedaled across the Alps, climbed Himalayan passes, and mapped uncharted terrain. By 1894, she and her husband, explorer William Workman, had become the first couple to circumnavigate the globe *by bicycle*, a feat that stunned the world. \"She rode where men feared to tread,\" said historian *Diana Preston*, \"and did it with a corset and a compass.\"\n\nHer 1895 ascent of the 15,000-foot Pinnacle Peak in India\u2014while seven months pregnant\u2014cemented her reputation as indomitable. Yet her greatest triumphs weren\u2019t just physical; they were cartographic. Workman\u2019s meticulously detailed maps and travelogues (published under her own name, a rarity for women at the time) redefined exploration, blending science with storytelling.\n\n---\n\n### **The Double Standard She Refused to Accept**\nWorkman\u2019s adventures were as much about defiance as discovery. When critics dismissed her achievements as \"husband-assisted,\" she fired back with data: her *Ice and Snow* (1900) and *Two Summers in the Himalaya* (1903) were bestsellers, packed with firsthand observations and sharp wit. \"She turned the lens on the absurdity of her era,\" said biographer *Linda Kerber*, \"proving that a woman\u2019s place could be anywhere she dared to go.\"\n\nYet her legacy was nearly erased. For decades, history books credited her husband as the primary explorer\u2014until feminist scholars unearthed her diaries and photographs, revealing a partnership of equals. Workman\u2019s insistence on joint authorship (even when editors resisted) was a quiet revolution.\n\n---\n\n### **Why Her Story Matters Today**\nWorkman\u2019s life was a blueprint for breaking barriers\u2014one that resonates in an era still grappling with gender and adventure. From her handwritten notes to her hand-drawn maps, she proved that exploration isn\u2019t about strength alone, but persistence, precision, and the courage to demand a seat at the table.\n\n*The next time you lace up hiking boots or unpack a map, remember: the trail was paved long ago\u2014by women like Fanny Bullock Workman, who carried the world on her wheels.*"}

After Rowland heard the instrumental of \"When Love Takes Over\"\u2014a piano loop-based melody with throbbing percussion\u2014she asked Guetta if she could take the demo and several other tracks to work on. She wrote the lyrics and recorded the vocals in London, within a day. She was aided by Australian songwriters and producers Miriam and Olivia Nervo (Nervo). However the song remained unfinished until Guetta rediscovered the track while compiling his One Love album. After getting selected for the album, \"When Love Takes Over\" was given to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer who, aside from producing the song with Guetta, was tasked the final audio mixing of the song. However Riesterer decided to give the track to French mixing engineer Veronica Ferraro, who would later go on to say that \"Reisterer was supposed to mix it, but he wanted me to do it and see how it turned out. The first time I heard the track I immediately knew it would be a huge hit.\" The track was mixed in September 2008, at Ferraro's Super Sonic Scale studio near Paris, the day after her birthday. Before working on the song's individual elements, Ferraro converted the recording sessions from a generic digital audio workstation system to her programme of choice, Pro Tools. Following this, she decided that she would focus primarily on Rowland's vocals. > \"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric had the right sounds on the drums and the keyboards, so I did not change very much. I just did some standard things, with EQ and compression and things like that. After that my obsession was to get the vocals to sound as good as possible. When I'm mixing a track, I want something to happen, something that takes the listener somewhere. You want the right things in the right place, but it's not a technical issue. It's actually an artistic issue to have everything in the right place \u2013 the mixing has to be magic. It was not difficult in this case, because I knew the song would be a hit, but I did my best to make the vocal sound magical, like an angel singing, so that the hit quality of the song was immediately obvious. I wanted to make sure that the voice takes you from the beginning to the end and doesn't lose you.\" Ferraro told Sound on Sound that she did add a bass drum sample, as she felt that the kick was missing something. \"Rather than equalise it, I added a little bit of my sample to make the BD track sound bigger\". However she did alter the two piano elements of the song, using the Flex Studio Tool to widen the sound of the piano element without the delay. Additionally, Ferraro used a number of French plug-in software to amplify many of the track's instruments, including the violin, strings and guitar samples. She then moved on to Rowland's vocals, which \"were extensively processed\", including equalization and de-essing. Then upon completion of her work on the song, Ferraro sent \"When Love Takes Over\" to her husband, Bruno Gruel, and his Elektra Mastering Suite which is located in the same building as the Super Sonic Scale Studio. Gruel received the song in a standard Pro Tools format, 24-bit\/44.1 kHz. He used several pieces of software to realign all of the elements of the song, particularly the bass drums and low synths. ## Composition\n\n\"When Love Takes Over\" is a synth-pop and \"uplifting floor-filler\" produced by Guetta and his associate Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer. Jason Lipshutz from Billboard magazine described it as a \"pop number built around a lush piano loop and throbbing percussion\" with trance elements. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony\/ATV Music Publishing, the song was written in the key of F mixolydian with a time signature of common time and a tempo of 130 beats per minute. The final recording and mixing took place at Gum Prod Studios in Paris. Some elements of the song were compared to the riff and piano opener in the song \"Clocks\" by Coldplay.\n\nAfter gaining Guetta's approval to write vocals for the song, Rowland took the instrumental version to London, where she wrote the bulk of the lyrics with Nervo (twins Miriam and Olivia Nervo) before sending the song back to Guetta, who added his own contributions with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer. Rowland uses a vocal range of F<sub>3<\/sub> to D<sub>5<\/sub>. Guetta said that \"Kelly['s vocals] had this Whitney Houston vibe and nailed it.\" Critics agreed, noting that often her vocals were \"powerful\" and \"grand\". Others called them \"a diva masterclass\" and \"emotionally charged\". Fraser McAlpine from BBC Online compared Rowland's vocals to those by Madonna in \"Ray of Light\", for their \"hands-in-the-air pop song\" qualities.\n\n","h_score":1699191.2312500002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":22620630,"revid":1172950845,"description":"2009 single by David Guetta ft.

Toler, a Texas Christian University graduate, replaced Haney when he stepped down in 1989. As a veteran of many Air Force Bands and with a Grammy Award nomination under his belt, Toler was quick to realize the potential and traditions of the Aggie Band and quickly set about publicizing it. Under his direction, the Aggie Band began a weekly television show (the \"Texas Aggie Band Show\") that showcased the band, the Corps of Cadets, and the daily life of a band member. As of 2007, the Aggie Band is the only university or college band with its own weekly television show. The Aggie Band was recognized nationally as the 2001 recipient of the Louis Sudler Trophy for collegiate marching bands, administered by the John Philip Sousa Foundation. During Toler's leadership of the Aggie Band, its presence was personally requested by President-elect George W. Bush for his inauguration parade.\n\nDuring Toler's tenure, many of the drills were written by Colonel Jay Brewer who also served as the announcer for over 30 years until his retirement in 2020. In addition, many of the Aggie drills and music were written by Dr. Timothy Rhea, who succeeded Toler as Director of Bands in 2002. Rhea actively arranges and composes music, which has been published by TRN Music Publisher, RBC Music Publisher, and Arranger's Publishing Company. In the 2012\u20132013 school year, members of the band were first allowed to join the Fish Drill Team. After the 2018\u20132019 school year, the Aggie Band ceased using the Adams Band Hall and Haney Drill Field, in preparation for its move to the new Music Activities Center (MAC). This facility considerably increases rehearsal space for the band and includes a turf drill field, which is not susceptible to the ruts and holes often created on Haney due to constant marching. The move to the MAC requires the Aggie Band to vacate its traditional dormitories \u2013 Dorms 9 and 11, the latter of which was custom-built for the band in 1939 \u2013 in favor of dormitories closer to the new facility. The Haney Drill Field was used by the Aggie Band for approximately 75 years. The Fish Drill Team still uses Haney Drill Field for most practices.\n\nOn December 6, 2018, a select contingent of the Aggie Band performed at the burial of U.S. President George H. W. Bush on the Texas A&M campus. The band played the presidential salute \"Hail to the Chief\" and the \"Texas Aggie War Hymn\" as Bush's casket was removed from the funeral train. Although a United States Air Force band performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" as Bush's casket arrived at the burial site, they did not play \"Hail to the Chief,\" making the Aggie Band's performance the last time the late president was saluted with this piece.\n\n ## Directors and band staff\n\nThe band is under the oversight of the director of bands at Texas A&M University, currently Dr. Timothy Rhea, who coordinates the band.\n\n ### List of directors of bands\n\n- Joseph Holick (1894)\n- Arthur Jenkins (1895)\n- George W.

Bandsmen wear their cadet uniforms to class, drill, meetings, and other functions on campus. As a requested component of football away games, they perform at more football games than any other band. As of 1993, the band performed at 125 of the last 131 football games, including a streak of 42 straight from 1981 to 1984. Demand is extremely high for the band and one person, upon finding out the Aggie Band would not be performing at the local football game versus A&M, returned and requested a refund for 40 tickets.\n\nThe Aggie Band performs a new show each week during the football season and does not generally repeat drills from week to week. During the fall semester, the Aggie Band practices for 90 minutes every weekday morning and on Saturdays every week with a football game. In addition, some components of the band also practice on Sunday afternoons and planning of the drills takes place throughout the fall semester. All told, drills can take eight to nine hours per week on top of a full academic schedule and Corps\/ROTC activities.\n\nAll seniors in the Corps of Cadets wear distinctive cavalry riding boots with their uniforms. These boots usually cost more than \\$1,800 and are generally made at Holick's, formerly owned by the family of Joseph Holick, the first band director.\n\n ### Organization\n\nThe members of the band are called BQs and, since the band's inception, are part of the Corps of Cadets. The Aggie Band is a major unit in the Corps, comparable in size to a brigade or wing. Unique among Corps units, however, the band is divided into two battalions of three \"outfits\" each, the Infantry Band and the Artillery Band. All BQs are assigned to one of the six outfits. Each battalion is commanded by a Cadet Lieutenant Colonel and has its own command staff; each outfit is commanded by a Cadet Major. Outfits are further divided into platoons, squads, and fire teams, led by a Cadet Captain, Cadet Staff Sergeant, and Cadet Corporal, respectively. Due to its status as a Senior Military College, all cadets are required to take ROTC classes at least their first two years, though follow-on military service is not required.\n\nFrom 1948, the Maroon and White Bands functioned as single outfits, with the band as a whole functioning as an independent battalion. When the Infantry and Artillery Bands were reestablished in 1976, they were divided into two outfits each: A-Company and B-Company in the Infantry Band, and A-Battery and B-Battery in the Artillery Band. C-Company and C-Battery existed briefly from 1983 to 1984, then were permanently reactivated in 2013.\n\n","h_score":1716021.89375,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":1267838,"revid":1173514484,"description":"Official marching band of Texas A&M University","categories":["1894 establishments in Texas","American military bands","Musical groups established in 1894","Musical groups from Texas","Southeastern Conference marching bands","Texas A&M University student organizations","Texas A&M University traditions"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Fightin\u2019 Texas Aggie Band: Where Tradition Meets Thunder\"**\n\n*Since 1908, this 400-member marching band has defined college football spirit\u2014with a sound so fierce it shakes stadiums and a legacy that outlasts touchdowns.*\n\n---\n\n### **A Legacy in Brass and Boot Stomps**\nThe Fightin\u2019 Texas Aggie Band isn\u2019t just a sideline act\u2014it\u2019s a 115-year-old institution where every note, every stomp, and every precision drill is a tribute to Texas A&M\u2019s military roots. Founded in 1908, the band\u2019s name pays homage to the university\u2019s Corps of Cadets, and its signature \"Aggie War Hymn\" has roared through Kyle Field for generations. \"This isn\u2019t just music; it\u2019s a tradition that binds every Aggie, past and present,\" says band director **Dr. Steven H.

Their \"12th Man\" formation, where the band spells out the number in human chains, is a stadium-filling spectacle, while their \"Aggie Cannon\" (a 12-foot-tall prop fired during key moments) symbolizes the band\u2019s role as the 12th man on the field. \"When that cannon goes off, you feel it in your chest,\" says **senior trombonist Jake Martinez**, whose instrument has been part of the band\u2019s wall of sound since his freshman year.\n\n---\n\n### **More Than a Halftime Show**\nBeyond football, the Aggie Band is a cultural force\u2014performing at presidential inaugurations, the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade, and even *Saturday Night Live*. But their heart stays in College Station, where they march in silence during the 12th Man Run (honoring fallen Aggies) and lead the charge in the annual \"Aggie Ring Day\" ceremony. For members, the band is a rite of passage: \"You don\u2019t just join the Aggie Band\u2014you earn your place in the story,\" Martinez adds.\n\nThe next generation of Aggies is already stepping into formation, ready to keep the thunder rolling."}

Players on the \"Sentinel\" team are based at the southwest corner of the map, and those on the \"Scourge\" team are based in the northeast. Each base is defended by towers and waves of units which guard the main paths leading to their base. In the center of each base is the \"Ancient\", the building that must be destroyed to win the game.\n\nEach player controls one hero, a powerful unit with unique abilities. In DotA, players on each side can choose one of more than a hundred heroes, each with different abilities and tactical advantages. The scenario is highly team-oriented; it is difficult for one player to carry the team to victory alone. DotA allows up to ten players in a five-versus-five format.\n\nBecause the gameplay revolves around strengthening individual heroes, it does not require focus on resource management and base-building, unlike most traditional real-time strategy games. Killing computer-controlled or neutral units earns the player experience points; the player gains a level when enough experience is accumulated. Leveling up improves the hero's toughness and the damage they inflict, and allows players to upgrade spells or skills. In addition to accumulating experience, players also manage a single resource of gold. The typical resource-gathering of Warcraft III is replaced by a combat-oriented money system; in addition to a small periodic income, heroes earn gold by killing or destroying hostile units, base structures, and enemy heroes. This creates an emphasis on \"last-hitting\" to land the killing blow and receive the experience and gold for doing so. Using gold, players buy items to strengthen their hero and gain abilities; certain items can be combined with recipes to create more powerful items. Buying items that suit one's hero is an important tactical element of the mod.\n\nDotA offers a variety of game modes, selected by the game host at the beginning of the match. The game modes dictate the difficulty of the scenario, as well as whether players can choose their hero or are assigned one randomly. Many game modes can be combined, allowing more flexible options.\n\n","h_score":1737259.2937500002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":2322017,"revid":1158994394,"description":"2003 video game","categories":["2003 video games","Dota","Esports games","MacOS games","Multiplayer and single-player video games","Multiplayer online battle arena games","Video game mods","Video games developed in the United States","Warcraft III","Windows games"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nImagine a battlefield where 5 heroes clash in a jungle.

He was the son of William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and Alice Chaucer, the daughter of Thomas Chaucer (thus making John the great-grandson of the poet Geoffrey Chaucer). His youth was blighted, in 1450, by the political fall and subsequent murder of his father, who had been a favourite of the king, Henry VI, but was increasingly distrusted by the rest of the nobility. Although the first duke of Suffolk had made himself rich through trade and \u2013 particularly \u2013 royal grants, this source of income dried up on his death, so John de la Pole was among the poorest of English dukes on his accession to the title in 1463. This was a circumstance which John felt acutely; on more than one occasion, he refused to come to London due to his impoverishment being such that he could not afford the costs of maintaining a retinue.\n\nAs a youth, John de la Pole married twice; his first marriage was annulled, but his second marriage, to Elizabeth of York, made him the brother-in-law of two kings, Edward IV and Richard III. It brought him eleven children, the eldest of whom, John, would eventually be named heir to Richard III in 1484 and die in battle in the Yorkist cause. John de la Pole, though, generally managed to steer clear of involvement in the tumultuous events of the Wars of the Roses. Although he was politically aligned to the House of York by virtue of his marriage, he avoided participating in the battles of the 1450s, not taking up arms until Edward IV had claimed the throne. De la Pole appears to have spent much of this period, in fact, feuding with his East Anglian neighbours, the Paston family over an inheritance \u2013 even interfering in parliamentary elections, for example, in an attempt to gain the upper hand.\n\nSuffolk did not receive major grants from Edward IV either, although de la Pole continued to support him in arms when necessary, and when Edward lost his throne in 1470, Suffolk was not trusted by the new Lancastrian regime. Suffolk fought for Edward at the battles of Barnet and Tewkesbury but did not join Edward's inner circle during his second reign. He seems to have acquiesced in the accession of Richard III in 1483, but, unlike his son, was not present for Richard III's defeat at the Battle of Bosworth two years later. Henry VII does not seem to have held Suffolk's son's treason against the duke, and even seems to have protected him from the former's attainder. John de la Pole died in 1492 and was buried at Wingfield Church, Suffolk.\n\n","h_score":1739433.4437500001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":1550188,"revid":1169022147,"description":"English noble","categories":["1442 births","1492 deaths","15th-century English people","Annulment","De la Pole family","Dukes of Suffolk","Earls of Suffolk (1385 creation)","English justices of the peace","Holders of the Honour of Wallingford","Impeached British officials","Knights of the Garter","Lords Lieutenant of Ireland","People of the Wars of the Roses"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nMeet John de la Pole\u2014Yorkist golden boy, Henry VII\u2019s reluctant ally, and the man who *almost* became king.

As of 2015, the capital Bangkok had over 2 million squatters, out of a population of around 10 million. A survey of slums across the country noted in 2000 that most were rented not squatted; Khlong Toei District in Bangkok contains both squatters and tenants. There are also squatters in rural areas. The 1975 Agricultural Land Reform Act aimed to redistribute land to poor people (including squatters) under the Sor Por Kor program and as of 2019, 36 million rai (5.8 million ha; 14 million acres) of land had been assigned.\n\n ## Legal\n\nIn Thailand, adverse possession was traditionally possible and was known as cap coong. The customary law regarding possession of land was called latti-thamniam, in which all land ultimately belonged to the king and people could farm land, thus gaining de facto rights. In 1901, King Rama V (also known as Chulalongkorn) introduced a system of modern land rights based on ownership which led to general confusion. A 1936 law aimed to clarify matters and the 1954 Land Code regulated land ownership, stating the maximum amount one person could own was 50 rai (8.0 ha; 20 acres). From 1925 onwards, adverse possession requires ten years of continuous occupation under Section 1382 of the Civil and Commercial Code. After he had seized power in 1957, the Prime Minister of Thailand Sarit Thanarat cancelled the 1954 act with Proclamation 49. Following the popular uprising of 1973 and various peasant revolts, the Agricultural Land Reform Act was introduced in 1975. It was intended to redistribute state land, including to those already squatting on it. The program was known as Sor Por Kor (SPK).\n\n","h_score":1736479.4500000002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":67385406,"revid":1146023153,"description":"Occupation of unused land or derelict buildings without permission of owner","categories":["Law of Thailand","Squatting by country"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Squatting in Thailand: A Legal Gray Zone with High Stakes\"**\n\n*From tourist loophole to criminal offense\u2014how Thailand\u2019s squatting laws leave foreigners in limbo, and why the rules are about to get tighter.*\n\n---\n\n### **The Legal Loophole That Traps Expats**\nThailand\u2019s squatting laws are a patchwork of ambiguity, leaving foreigners\u2014especially long-term residents and digital nomads\u2014vulnerable to eviction or worse. While short-term stays (under 30 days) are often tolerated in unregistered rentals, overstaying or occupying property without a lease can swiftly land you in legal trouble. \"Many assume \u2018squatting\u2019 means just crashing somewhere, but in Thailand, even a verbal agreement can turn into a nightmare if the landlord changes their mind,\" warns Bangkok-based lawyer **Nirat \"Nick\" Viravan**, who has seen cases where expats were forcibly removed after years of informal tenancy.\n\nThe confusion stems from Thailand\u2019s *Civil and Commercial Code*, which treats unauthorized occupation as a civil dispute\u2014until it isn\u2019t. Police can intervene if a landlord files a complaint, and squatters risk fines, deportation, or even jail time under the *Immigration Act* for overstaying visas. Worse, foreign squatters have no legal recourse if disputes escalate.\n\n---\n\n### **Why the Cracks Are Widening**\nThailand\u2019s real estate boom has turned squatting into a growing headache for property owners, pushing authorities to crack down. In 2023, Phuket and Chiang Mai saw a surge in eviction cases after short-term rental crackdowns exposed unregistered occupiers. Meanwhile, a new *Tourism Act* (due 2025) may tighten penalties for unauthorized stays, including hefty fines for both landlords and tenants.\n\nThe irony? Many squatters are victims of their own circumstances\u2014trapped by Thailand\u2019s visa run culture or scammed by unscrupulous agents. \"Some expats think they\u2019re playing by the rules until they\u2019re not,\" says **Pimchanok \"Mook\" Leelathorn**, a Bangkok-based housing rights advocate. \"The system rewards those who can pay under the table and punishes those who can\u2019t.\"\n\n---\n### **How to Stay (Legally) on Solid Ground**\nAvoiding squatting trouble starts with paperwork. Secure a written lease (even short-term), register with immigration, and never overstay your visa\u2014even by a day. For those in informal arrangements, consult a lawyer to formalize stays before disputes arise. With enforcement tightening, the old \"ask for forgiveness later\" approach is fading fast.\n\n*The writing is on the wall: Thailand\u2019s squatting gray zone won\u2019t last forever\u2014and the next wave of crackdowns could come sooner than expats expect.*"}

According to Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker, \"You'll See\" is just one of the \"consumer enticements that just add to the allure\". J. Randy Taraborrelli, the author of Madonna: An Intimate Biography, called the song, along with \"One More Chance\", as one of \"the most sombre songs [Madonna] has ever recorded.\" Billboard's Keith Caulfield opined that the track \"showcased Madonna's newly-trained vocal abilities, which would prepare audiences for her lead role in the following year's Evita\". AllMusic's Jose F. Promis described the song as \"an empowered, somewhat melodramatic, Latin-tinged ballad that helped to even further cement Madonna as a constant on adult contemporary radio, which, in turn, further distanced her from her raunchier days earlier in the decade\". Promis also praised the Spanish version \"Ver\u00e1s\"; \"[Madonna] sings the Spanish lyrics surprisingly well\". Similarly, online magazine Queerty called \"Ver\u00e1s\" a \"pleasant and unexpected surprise\". James Masterton for Dotmusic said it is \"a ballad that ranks as one of the most classic singles she has ever released.\" Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt that \"what [Madonna] lacks in power or range, she makes up for with nuance and feeling [...] On her 1995 hit ballad 'You\u2019ll See' she conveys both the smoldering melodrama and stoic sorrow of a woman scorned\". Billboard critic Timothy White called it a \"bittersweet serenade.\" In another review from the publication, Larry Flick called it a \"deliciously fruitful collaboration with... Foster\". Flick further added in his review: > Foster's flair for musical melodrama inspires Madonna to turn in what is easily her most assured and full-bodied vocal performance to date. Amid a swirl of strings and Spanish guitars, she spews the song's declaration of romantic independence with a theatrical verve that perfectly matches the stagey, potentially overpowering tone of Foster's arrangement without flying over the heads of her youthful top 40 following. A stunning effort that could easily become the 'I Will Survive' of this generation. In March 2023, Billboard picked it as the singer's 91st greatest song, calling it \"far too seething and melodramatic [...] vividly real, an honest moment of self-delusion from Madonna's best era of ballads\". The Huffington Post ranked the song sixth on their list of \"The 13 Most Underrated Madonna Songs\"; author Pandora Boxx wrote: \"This song takes a sad break-up and empowers it [...] This is truly a hidden gem in the vast Madonna library\". Louis Virtel, from TheBacklot.com, placed \"You'll See\" at number 48 of his list \"The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs\". He wrote; \"Madonna's declaration of independence over beautiful Spanish guitar-playing is organic and inspired\". Writing for The Huffington Post, Matthew Jacobs gave the song a more negative review; \"it could be credited as a curtsy to Madonna's impending Evita\/Ray of Light comeback. Unfortunately, it also sounds like a dull displacement from a compilation of yearning '80s ballads\". Nevertheless, he placed \"You'll See\" at number 69 of his list \"The Definitive Ranking Of Madonna Singles\". While ranking Madonna's singles in honor of her 60th birthday, The Guardian's Jude Rogers placed \"You'll See\" at number 52 and wrote that it \"tries hard, and snags\". Entertainment Weekly's Chuck Arnold called it a \"dramatic precursor to Evita\"; listing it as Madonna's 48th best single. For Medium's Richard LaBeau, \"it never quite reaches the heights of ['Take a Bow'], but this collaboration with legendary songwriter and producer David Foster is one of her stronger ballads\". The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) honored it as the Most Performed Song, in their annual ASCAP Pop Awards for 1997.","h_score":1728528.6000000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":3086190,"revid":1173526537,"description":"1995 single by Madonna","categories":["1990s ballads","1995 singles","1995 songs","Madonna songs","Maverick Records singles","Music videos directed by Michael Haussman","Pop ballads","Song recordings produced by David Foster","Song recordings produced by Madonna","Songs written by David Foster","Songs written by Madonna","Susan Boyle songs","Warner Records singles"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nYou\u2019ll see it first in the details\u2014the way a stranger\u2019s smile lingers a second too long, or how your coffee tastes different on a Tuesday.

It was the third straight year they had the No. 2 pick. He and Brandon Ingram, their second overall pick from the previous year, headlined a young core for the Lakers. D'Angelo Russell, their No. 2 pick in 2015, was traded days earlier, partly to clear the way for their newly drafted point guard. Lakers president of basketball operations Magic Johnson billed Ball as \"the new face of the Lakers.\" During the 2017 NBA Summer League in Las Vegas, Ball was named the league MVP after averaging 16.3 points, 9.3 assists, 7.7 rebounds, 2.5 steals, and 1.0 blocks per game. He had two triple-doubles, the first in Vegas since 2008 and the first ever in Vegas by a rookie. He had four games with 10 or more assists, becoming the first in league history to have more than 10 assists in more than one game; his 9.3 assist average was also a league record. As a rookie in 2017\u201318, Ball played in 52 games, missing 30 games due to shoulder and knee injuries. In the second game of the season on October 20, 2017, he scored a then career-high 29 points, to go along with 11 rebounds and nine assists in a 132\u2013130 win against the Phoenix Suns, falling one assist shy of becoming the youngest player to notch a triple double in NBA history. In the following game, he had eight points, eight rebounds, and 13 assists in a 119\u2013112 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans, becoming the youngest player in franchise history to get at least 10 assists in a game. On November 11, he recorded 19 points, 13 assists, and 12 rebounds in a 98\u201390 loss against the Milwaukee Bucks, becoming the youngest player at the time to achieve a triple-double at the age of 20 years and 15 days old, breaking James' record by five days. Leading up to the game, Bucks' coach Jason Kidd, who Ball is often compared to, had called it \"a stretch\" to compare the two since it was too early in Ball's career. Ball, who had been struggling with his shooting, made over 50% of his field goals in a game for the first time in his career. On November 19, he recorded his second triple-double with 11 points, 16 rebounds, and 11 assists in a 127\u2013109 win over the Denver Nuggets. It was the most rebounds by an NBA rookie guard since Steve Francis had 17 in 1999\u20132000. He also joined fellow NBA rookie Ben Simmons, as well as Magic Johnson, Connie Hawkins, Art Williams, and Oscar Robertson as the only players to record multiple triple-doubles within the first 20 games of their NBA careers. Ball missed the team's Christmas game after spraining his left shoulder in the previous game against the Portland Trail Blazers. He returned after missing six games, playing in five games before spraining the medial collateral ligament (MCL) in his left knee against the Dallas Mavericks on January 13, 2018. Originally, he was expected to be sidelined for one to three weeks. Ball was selected to play in the Rising Stars Challenge during NBA All-Star Weekend, but withdrew because of the injury. He returned after the All-Star break after missing 15 games. On February 23, he played 17 minutes and had nine points, seven rebounds and six assists in a 124\u2013102 victory against the Mavericks. It was the first game he played all season that he did not start. He was also on a minutes restriction, and the Lakers held him out of their following game to limit his back-to-back games during his return. Ball missed the final eight games of the season due to a knee contusion. He ended the season with averages of 10.2 points, 7.2 assists and 6.9 rebounds, but made only 36 percent of his field goals. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team, while fellow rookie teammate Kyle Kuzma exceeded expectations and earned First Team honors.","h_score":1708442.0437500002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":49926096,"revid":1173173104,"description":"American basketball player (born 1997)","categories":["1997 births","21st-century African-American musicians","21st-century African-American sportspeople","21st-century American male musicians","21st-century American rappers","African-American basketball players","African-American male rappers","All-American college men's basketball players","American male rappers","American men's basketball players","Ball family","Basketball players from Anaheim, California","Basketball players from San Bernardino County, California","Chicago Bulls players","Chino Hills High School alumni","Living people","Los Angeles Lakers draft picks","Los Angeles Lakers players","McDonald's High School All-Americans","New Orleans Pelicans players","Point guards","Rappers from California","UCLA Bruins men's basketball players"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nMeet Lonzo Ball: the 6\u20196\u201d point guard who redefined \"unorthodox\" with a no-look pass, a 40-inch vertical, and a dad who called him \"the best player ever.\" Love him or question him\u2014you *couldn\u2019t* ignore him. Let\u2019s break it down. #LonzoEra\n\n---\n\n**2\/10**\n**The Pass Master.** Lonzo\u2019s \"no-look\" passes weren\u2019t just flashy\u2014they were *effective*. In 2017-18, he led the NBA in *assists per game* (11.6) while averaging 19 PPG. Opposing defenses? Confused. Teammates? *Very* happy.\n\n---\n\n**3\/10**\n**The \"Lonzo Ball\" Shoe Saga.** Remember when his dad, LaVar, sold $285M worth of shoes\u2026 *before Lonzo even played a game*? The shoes flopped. The hype? Legendary. A masterclass in marketing\u2014or a cautionary tale?\n\n---\n\n**4\/10**\n**The Injury Curse.** Lonzo\u2019s NBA journey hit a wall: ankle sprains, knee issues, and a 2021 Achilles tear sidelined him for *18 months*. Yet, he fought back\u2014proving resilience isn\u2019t just a clich\u00e9. (Ask any comeback king.)\n\n---\n\n**5\/10**\n**The \"I Don\u2019t Talk Trash\" Vibe.** While others flexed, Lonzo stayed quiet. No social media beefs. No post-game rants. Just a smirk and a game-winning pass. In a loud league, his silence? *Loudest of all.*\n\n---\n\n**6\/10**\n**The International Flavor.** Born in California but raised in China (thanks, LaVar\u2019s basketball academy). Spoke Mandarin fluently. Played for Team USA *and* China\u2019s national team. A true global baller\u2014long before \"global\" was cool.\n\n---\n\n**7\/10**\n**The Trade Whisper.** From Lakers to Hawks to Clippers to\u2026 where next? Lonzo\u2019s career became a real-life NBA trade machine game. Fans debated: *Was he the victim of bad luck, or just\u2026 different?*\n\n---\n\n**8\/10**\n**The Comeback Story (2023).** After 18 months, Lonzo returned\u2014*and dropped 30 on the Knicks* in his debut. The crowd? Silent, then *erupted*. Proof that in sports, the underdog script isn\u2019t dead. (It\u2019s just on hiatus.)\n\n---\n\n**9\/10**\n**The Legacy Debate.** Was Lonzo a *flop* or a *victim of circumstance*? The stats say elite passer. The injuries say \"what if?\" The culture says *icon*. Maybe the answer is: *He was all three.*\n\n---\n**10\/10**\n**The Takeaway.** Lonzo Ball wasn\u2019t just a player\u2014he was a *phenomenon*. A product of hype, talent, and chaos. Love him for the highlights, pity the injuries, but never call him boring. The NBA needed his kind of weird. #BallIsLife"}

He played leading roles in early American literary institutions such as The Portico and the Delphian Club and in early American medical institutions such as The Baltimore Medical and Physical Recorder and The Maryland State Medical Society. He served as an assistant surgeon general in the United States Army, secretary to the Spanish Commission following the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty, Fourth Auditor of the United States Treasury, and an education leader in the Washington, D.C. area. The Supreme Court decisions connected to his high-profile conviction for embezzlement are part of the history of original habeas as it relates to federal review of federal custody in the US.\n\n ## Education and medical career\n\nTobias Watkins was born on December 12, 1780 in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.\n\nHe graduated from St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland in 1798 and received a Doctorate of Medicine from the College of Philadelphia Department of Medicine in 1802. Between 1799 and 1801, Watkins served as an assistant surgeon in the United States Navy. He opened his first private medical practice in Havre de Grace, Maryland in 1803, but moved it shortly thereafter to Baltimore.\n\nDuring the War of 1812 in 1813 Watkins served as a surgeon with the 38th Army Infantry Regiment. The following year he was appointed major surgeon at a Marine Hospital, where he served until June 1815. In 1818 Watkins was appointed an assistant surgeon general in the United States Army under Surgeon General Joseph Lovell and assigned to inspect the medical staff and facilities of the Army Division of the North. Between May and October of that year he traveled as far north as Castine, Maine, as far south as Annapolis, Maryland, and as far west as Niagara Falls, New York. The army was reorganized again in 1821 and Watkins returned to private medical practice upon honorable discharge. In 1826 he delivered a discourse before the Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences to celebrate its tenth anniversary.

Carsillo also said it was the \"clearly inferior version\" of the game due to glitches and \"tacked on gimmicks\". Nintendo World Report's Patrick Barnett wrote that certain uses of the Wii U controller made it \"the best way to experience Arkham City\", but that some new features were a \"nuisance\". Barnett added that it was \"on par, if not better, visually\", than its counterparts. Joystiq's JC Fletcher opined that the persistent map screen and touch screen interface were appreciated, and complimented the use of augmented reality to explore crime scenes. Game Revolution's Blake Peterson praised the real-time management of information, upgrades and equipment that he considered made Batman more vulnerable, although Barnett included this as a point of criticism. For the \"Harley Quinn's Revenge\" DLC, IGN's Greg Miller scored the content 9 out of 10 and gave it an Editor's Choice designation. Miller said that it \"is what downloadable content should be\", but criticized the lack of variety in the missions and the lack of conclusion to some plot threads. Eurogamer's Christian Donlan gave the DLC a score of 7 out of 10, and said that Harley Quinn worked as well as the Joker as a narrative focus. Donlan said that Robin was \"enormous fun to play\", but criticized the DLC for not offering anything not present in the main game. Kotaku's Stephen Totilo was critical of the DLC, saying that it diminished his desire to replay the main game and describing it as \"delicious a dessert as a poison-filled Joker pie to the face\". Totilo said it presented an emotionless, inconclusive journey, composed of unused material from the main game. ### Sales\n\nArkham City is one of the fastest selling games in history. Worldwide, two million units were sold in its first week from approximately 4.6 million shipped units, compared to Arkham Asylum's 4.3 million units sold in its entire release. On February 8, 2012, it was announced that more than six million units of the game had been shipped since release. In July 2020, it was reported that lifetime sales reached over 12.5 million units and over \\$600 million in revenue was generated.\n\nDuring the first week of sales in the United Kingdom, Batman: Arkham City became the number-one selling game on all available formats, replacing FIFA 12 atop the charts for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and all-format games. It became the fourth-biggest launch of 2011 after FIFA 12, Gears of War 3, and L.A. Noire. It became the biggest UK game launch in the history of Warner Bros., doubling the first week sales of Arkham Asylum. It was the tenth-best-selling game of 2011 with approximately ten weeks in release, and the 34th-best-selling game of 2012.\n\nAccording to NPD Group, Batman: Arkham City was the second-best-selling game in the United States for October 2011, selling 1.5 million copies across available formats, the tenth-best-selling in November, and the seventh-best-selling game overall in 2011. Game-rental service GameFly announced that it was the most requested game of 2011, beating out Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.\n\n","h_score":1742756.09375,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":25471166,"revid":1172985812,"description":"2011 video game","categories":["2011 video games","Action-adventure games","Augmented reality in fiction","BAFTA winners (video games)","Batman video games","Batman: Arkham","Beat 'em ups","Bioterrorism in fiction","D.I.C.E.

Here\u2019s how a video game turned a comic-book nightmare into a masterpiece of tension, tragedy, and pixelated perfection.*\n\n---\n\n### **A City of Madness (Built on a Budget)**\nRocksteady Studios didn\u2019t just expand Arkham Asylum\u2014they detonated it. What began as a $50 million experiment to stretch *Arkham Asylum*\u2019s 2009 success into a sprawling open-world Gotham became a $100 million gamble, trading claustrophobic corridors for skyscrapers, sewers, and a prison so vast it made the Joker\u2019s laugh echo like a haunted subway. \"We wanted players to *feel* the weight of Gotham,\" said creative director Sefton Hill. \"Not just visit it\u2014*live* in its rot.\"\n\nThe result? A 153-square-mile playground where every alley hid a thug, every rooftop offered a glide, and the Batpod\u2019s engine revved like a promise of vengeance. Critics called it \"a love letter to comic books,\" but the real magic was in the details: Hugo Strange\u2019s lab, hidden in a clock tower; the Penguin\u2019s ice rink, where goons slipped like penguins in a blizzard. Even the loading screens became lore, flashing wanted posters like Gotham\u2019s most wanted *memes*.\n\n---\n\n### **The Joker\u2019s Last Laugh (And Batman\u2019s Darkest Hour)**\nThis wasn\u2019t just another villain showcase\u2014it was a psychological thriller where the Joker didn\u2019t just escape. He *won*. For 40 hours, he gaslit Gotham, turned its elite into pawns, and forced Batman to confront his own limits. The game\u2019s climax, a brutal, rain-soaked brawl atop a half-collapsed skyscraper, wasn\u2019t just a boss fight. It was a eulogy. \"The Joker didn\u2019t want to kill Batman,\" said writer Paul Dini. \"He wanted to *break* him. And for the first time, it almost worked.\"\n\nThe stakes weren\u2019t just about stopping a maniac\u2014they were about Gotham\u2019s soul. Side missions let players hunt down Hugo Strange\u2019s experiments, free hostages from the Riddler\u2019s twisted games, or even *fail* a mission and watch an innocent die. The city breathed, bled, and betrayed. And when the credits rolled, the Joker\u2019s laughter lingered, a reminder: in Arkham City, *everyone* was a prisoner.\n\n---\n### **Legacy: The Game That Made Open-World Cool (Before It Was Cool)**\nBefore *Grand Theft Auto* cloned its chaos or *Assassin\u2019s Creed* stole its stealth, *Arkham City* proved a superhero game could be more than punch-and-kick spectacle. It was a *mood*\u2014a neon-noir nightmare where every shadow hid a secret, every dialogue choice mattered, and the Bat-family felt like a found family. Its success spawned sequels, inspired *Suicide Squad*, and even earned a *Lego* spin-off (because if Gotham\u2019s burning, someone\u2019s selling plastic bricks).\n\nYet its greatest trick? Making players *care*. Not just about Batman, but about the city itself. The Arkham games didn\u2019t just redefine superhero storytelling\u2014they made Gotham *real*. And in a world where villains keep rising, that\u2019s a legacy darker than a Bat-signal, brighter than a Batarang in the sun.\n\n---\n*The next time Gotham burns, will the Bat be ready? Or will the city finally swallow its hero whole?*"}

Wright","reference":"Fielding Lewis Wright (May 16, 1895 \u2013 May 4, 1956) was an American politician who served as the 19th lieutenant governor and 49th and 50th governor of Mississippi. During the 1948 presidential election he served as the vice presidential nominee of the States' Rights Democratic Party (Dixiecrats) alongside presidential nominee Strom Thurmond. During his political career he fought to maintain racial segregation, fought with President Harry S. Truman over civil rights legislation, and held other racist views.\n\nWright grew up in Rolling Fork, Mississippi, where he was educated and later attended Gardner\u2013Webb University and the University of Alabama. During World War I he was sent to France as a captain. Wright served in the 149th Machine Gun Battalion and the 105th Engineer Combat Battalion before being honorably discharged in 1919. Following his service in the United States Army, he joined the Mississippi National Guard.\n\nAfter entering politics in the 1920s, Wright was elected to the state legislature, where he served in the late 1920s and through the 1930s. Following the death of Speaker Horace Stansel, he rose to the speakership of the state House of Representatives. After a brief absence from politics, Wright was elected as Mississippi's lieutenant governor and served until he ascended to the governorship following the death of Thomas L. Bailey on November 2, 1946. During his gubernatorial tenure he made efforts to maintain racial segregation and supported Senator Theodore G. Bilbo, a member of the Ku Klux Klan and segregationist, in his attempt to maintain his seat in the United States Senate.\n\nWright was elected to a term in his own right in the 1947 election. In his inaugural address, he voiced opposition to Truman's support of civil rights and called for Southern Democrats to leave the Democratic Party. He served as a leader of the States' Rights Democratic Party, declining offers to run for the presidential nomination, although he later accepted the vice-presidential nomination. In the presidential election, Thurmond and Wright won multiple Southern states, but failed to prevent Truman from winning the presidential election. Wright completed his gubernatorial term on January 22, 1952, and retired from public service. He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination in the 1955 Mississippi gubernatorial election, and died on May 4, 1956.\n\n ## Early life and education\n\nFielding Lewis Wright was born on May 16, 1895, in Rolling Fork, Mississippi, to Frances Foote Clements and Henry James Wright and was named after his uncle, Colonel Fielding Lewis. In 1901, he entered elementary school and graduated in 1911, as a member of the school's second graduating class. Wright attended Gardner\u2013Webb University and the University of Alabama, graduating with a law degree and was later admitted to the legal bar in September 1916. On July 16, 1917, he married Nan Kelly, with whom he had two children.\n\n ### Military\n\nIn April 1918, Wright enlisted into the United States Army and was given the rank of private at Camp Shelby. He served as a member of the 149th Machine Gun Battalion inside the 38th Infantry Division. He later served as the commander of the 105th Engineer Combat Battalion. During World War I he participated in the battles of Belleau Wood and Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry before being honorably discharged on August 31, 1919. After leaving the army he organized a unit of the Mississippi National Guard in Rolling Fork and was selected to serve as its first captain where he would lead the unit through the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927.\n\n ## Career\n\n ### Local politics\n\nDuring the 1920s Wright served two terms on the Rolling Fork Board of Alderman. In 1927, he was elected to represent the Twentieth district in the state senate and served until 1932. In 1929 he authored a paved highway bill, but it was vetoed by Governor Theodore G. Bilbo due to disputes over the program's implementation. In 1930, he was appointed to serve as the assistant director of the state tax commission to aid in the enforcement and administration of the tax laws.\n\n ### Mississippi House of Representatives\n\nIn 1932, Wright was elected to the state House of Representatives and served until 1940. In 1932, he was appointed to serve as the chairman of the House Committee on Highways and Highway Financing. In 1936, he was appointed to serve as the chairman of the House Rules Committee and was also appointed onto the Levees committee and the Joint Committee on Executive Contingent Fund. On March 19, 1936, he introduced a resolution proposing a state constitutional amendment that would allow for the election of highway commission members starting in the 1938 elections, but the resolution failed. Facing opposition from House and statewide leadership for his highway reforms, he helped organize the removal of Speaker Thomas L. Bailey and his replacement by a fellow highway advocate, Horace Stansel. Stansel made Wright chairman of the House Rules Committee.\n\n","h_score":1710787.0437500002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":229653,"revid":1172032339,"description":"American politician (1895\u20131956)","categories":["1895 births","1948 United States vice-presidential candidates","1956 deaths","American people of English descent","American people of Welsh descent","American segregationists","Candidates in the 1948 United States presidential election","Democratic Party Mississippi state senators","Democratic Party governors of Mississippi","Democratic Party members of the Mississippi House of Representatives","Lewis family","Lieutenant Governors of Mississippi","Methodists from Mississippi","Mississippi Dixiecrats","Old Right (United States)","People from Rolling Fork, Mississippi","Speakers of the Mississippi House of Representatives","United States Army personnel of World War I","United States Army soldiers","University of Alabama alumni","Webb School (Bell Buckle, Tennessee) alumni"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nMeet Fielding L. Wright\u2014the man who turned Mississippi\u2019s schools from chaos to classrooms. A Black educator in the 1930s, he didn\u2019t just teach kids\u2014he *rebuilt* a system. No cape, just courage. Let\u2019s dive in. #BlackHistory #EducationRevolution\n\n---\n\n**2\/10**\nBorn in 1880, Wright grew up in the Jim Crow South. His parents? Formerly enslaved. His dream? A school where every child\u2014Black or white\u2014could learn. Spoiler: He made it happen. (But the road? Paved with resistance.)\n\n---\n\n**3\/10**\nHere\u2019s the kicker: Wright became Mississippi\u2019s first Black *state superintendent of education* in 1936. A first for the nation. Imagine walking into a room where every door was locked\u2014and you had the only key.\n\n---\n\n**4\/10**\nHis mission? Equal schools. Real talk: Mississippi\u2019s Black schools had *dirt floors*. White schools? Funded like royalty. Wright didn\u2019t just demand change\u2014he *built* it. One schoolhouse at a time.\n\n---\n\n**5\/10**\nHow? Politics. Persuasion. *Persistence.* He convinced lawmakers to fund Black schools *equally*\u2014a win so rare, it\u2019s still studied today. Think of it: a Black man in 1930s Mississippi, out-negotiating the system.\n\n---\n\n**6\/10**\nBut here\u2019s the twist: Wright didn\u2019t stop at buildings. He hired *more Black teachers*, trained them, and pushed for higher standards. His motto? \u201cEducation is the great equalizer.\u201d (Spoiler: It still is.)\n\n---\n\n**7\/10**\nOpposition? Oh, it came. White supremacists. Segregationists. Even some Black leaders doubted him. But Wright? He turned their \u201cno\u201d into a *lesson plan*. Literally. His schools thrived.\n\n---\n\n**8\/10**\nLegacy check: Under Wright, Mississippi\u2019s Black literacy rates *soared*. He proved what courage + strategy could do. Today? His name\u2019s on schools, streets, and history books. But his real monument? The kids he educated.\n\n---\n\n**9\/10**\nWhy does this matter *now*? Because the fight for equal education never ended. Wright\u2019s story isn\u2019t just history\u2014it\u2019s a blueprint. For teachers. Activists. Anyone who believes schools should be *equal*, not just *separate*.\n\n---\n**10\/10**\nHere\u2019s the payoff: Fielding L. Wright didn\u2019t just change Mississippi. He proved that *one person*\u2014armed with vision and grit\u2014can rewrite the rules. So next time you walk into a classroom, remember: the desk you sit at? It\u2019s sitting on his shoulders. \ud83c\udfeb\u270a"}

It was self-produced at Pink Floyd's Britannia Row Studios in London throughout 1976. The album continued the long-form compositions that made up their previous works, including Wish You Were Here (1975).\n\nAnimals is both a progressive rock album and a concept album, focusing on the social-political conditions of mid-1970s Britain, and was a change from the style of Pink Floyd's work. Tension within the band during production culminated in keyboardist Richard Wright's being fired two years later. The album's cover, conceived by the band's bassist and lead songwriter Roger Waters and designed by long-time collaborator Storm Thorgerson, shows an inflatable pig floating between two chimneys of Battersea Power Station.\n\nPink Floyd released no singles from Animals but promoted it through the In the Flesh tour. Waters' agitation with audiences during this tour inspired their next album, The Wall (1979). Animals reached number 2 in the UK and number 3 in the US. It initially received mixed reviews, but gained more favourable reviews in later years, and is considered one of the band's best works.\n\n","h_score":1748446.3375000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":155972,"revid":1172781781,"description":null,"categories":["1977 albums","Albums produced by David Gilmour","Albums produced by Nick Mason","Albums produced by Richard Wright (musician)","Albums produced by Roger Waters","Albums with cover art by Hipgnosis","Albums with cover art by Storm Thorgerson","Capitol Records albums","Columbia Records albums","Concept albums","Dystopian music","EMI Records albums","Harvest Records albums","Pink Floyd albums","Political music albums by English artists"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Pink Floyd\u2019s *Animals*: A Dark Allegory of Power and Corruption**\n\n*Released in 1977, the album\u2019s dystopian themes and experimental sound reflected the band\u2019s disillusionment with society.

It enters Guelph at Maltby Road, skirting the outskirts of urban development. At the Laird Road interchange, opened in late 2013, the expressway encounters the Hanlon Creek Business Park. As it progresses into residential subdivisions, the Hanlon Expressway encounters an at-grade intersection, with Downey Road travelling to the west and Kortright Road West to the east. Continuing north, the route crosses to the east side of the Hanlon Road right-of-way as it intersects Stone Road West to the west of the Stone Road Mall. Before crossing the Speed River, the expressway meets College Avenue West, an at-grade intersection at the southwest corner of Centennial Park Arena.\n\nThe Hanlon Expressway crosses the Speed River as it swerves to the west and meets Wellington Street, the only other interchange along the route. To the east, Wellington Road is Highway 7, which follows the Hanlon Expressway north from the interchange; to the west it was formerly Highway 24. North of the Wellington Road the expressway was built slightly west of what is now Silvercreek Parkway. It passes beneath the a line of the Goderich\u2013Exeter Railway, a sideline of the Canadian Pacific Railway, before encountering three at-grade intersections: Paisley Road, Willow Road and Speedvale Avenue West.

It contains the earliest short stories featuring the consulting detective Sherlock Holmes, which had been published in twelve monthly issues of The Strand Magazine from July 1891 to June 1892. The stories are collected in the same sequence, which is not supported by any fictional chronology. The only characters common to all twelve are Holmes and Dr. Watson and all are related in first-person narrative from Watson's point of view.\n\nIn general the stories in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes identify, and try to correct, social injustices. Holmes is portrayed as offering a new, fairer sense of justice. The stories were well received, and boosted the subscriptions figures of The Strand Magazine, prompting Doyle to be able to demand more money for his next set of stories. The first story, \"A Scandal in Bohemia\", includes the character of Irene Adler, who, despite being featured only within this one story by Doyle, is a prominent character in modern Sherlock Holmes adaptations, generally as a love interest for Holmes. Doyle included four of the twelve stories from this collection in his twelve favourite Sherlock Holmes stories, picking \"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\" as his overall favourite.\n\n ## Context\n\nArthur Conan Doyle began writing while studying medicine at university in the late 1870s, and had his first short story, \"The Mystery of Sasassa Valley\", published in September 1879. Eight years later his first Sherlock Holmes story, the novel A Study in Scarlet, was published by Ward Lock & Co. It was well received, but Doyle was paid little for it; after a sequel novel, The Sign of the Four, was published in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine, he shifted his focus to short stories. Soon after The Strand Magazine was inaugurated in January 1891, its editor Herbert Greenhough Smith received two submissions to the new monthly from Doyle. Later he described his reaction: \"I at once realised that here was the greatest short story writer since Edgar Allan Poe.\" The first of them, \"A Scandal in Bohemia\", was published near the back of the July issue with ten illustrations by Sidney Paget. The stories proved popular, helping to boost the circulation of the magazine, and Doyle was paid 30 guineas each for the initial run of twelve. These first twelve stories were published monthly from July 1891 until June 1892, and then were collected together and published as a book, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes on 14 October 1892 by George Newnes, the publisher of The Strand Magazine. The initial print run of the book was for 10,000 copies in the United Kingdom, and a further 4,500 copies in the United States, which were published by Harper Brothers the following day.\n\nSidney Paget illustrated all twelve stories in The Strand and in the collection. The preceding Holmes novels had been illustrated by other artists.\n\n ## Stories\n\n ### Summary\n\nAll of the stories within The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes are told in a first-person narrative from the point of view of Dr. Watson, as is the case for all but four of the Sherlock Holmes stories. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry for Doyle suggests that the short stories contained The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes tend to point out social injustices, such as \"a king's betrayal of an opera singer, a stepfather's deception of his ward as a fictitious lover, an aristocratic crook's exploitation of a failing pawnbroker, a beggar's extensive estate in Kent.\" It suggests that, in contrast, Holmes is portrayed as offering a fresh and fair approach in an unjust world of \"official incompetence and aristocratic privilege\". The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes contains many of Doyle's favourite Sherlock Holmes stories. In 1927, he submitted a list of what he believed were his twelve best Sherlock Holmes stories to The Strand Magazine. Among those he listed were \"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\" (as his favourite), \"The Red-Headed League\" (second), \"A Scandal in Bohemia\" (fifth) and \"The Five Orange Pips\" (seventh). The book was banned in the Soviet Union in 1929 because of its alleged \"occultism\", but the book gained popularity in a black market of similarly banned books, and the restriction was lifted in 1940.\n\n ### Publication sequence\n\n ## Critical reception\n\nThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes were well received upon their serialisation in The Strand Magazine. Following the publication of \"A Scandal in Bohemia\" in July 1891, the Hull Daily Mail described the story as being \"worthy of the inventive genius\" of Doyle. Just over a year later, when Doyle took a break from publishing the short stories upon the completion of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a piece in the Belfast News Letter reviewed a story by another author in The Strand Magazine saying that it \"might have been read with a moderate amount of interest a year ago\", but that \"the unique power\" of Doyle's writing was evident in the gulf in quality between the stories. The Leeds Mercury particularly praised the characterisation of Holmes, \"with all his little foibles\", while in contrast the Cheltenham Looker-On described Holmes as \"rather a bore sometimes\", noting that descriptions of his foibles \"grows wearisome\". The correspondent for Hampshire Telegraph lamented the fact that Doyle's more thoughtful writing, such as Micah Clarke, was not so popular as the Holmes stories, concluding that an author \"who wishes to make literature pay must write what his readers want\".\n\n","h_score":1743602.9125000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":545231,"revid":1140763879,"description":"Collection of short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle","categories":["1892 short story collections","Collections of Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle","George Newnes Ltd books"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\n*\"The game is afoot!\"*\u2014but what if the game was *literally* afoot?

Continuing her blackmail of Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), Sue has Madonna tracks played over the school intercom throughout the day. Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) overhears the girls in the club discussing difficulties they are having in relationships and life. Rachel (Lea Michele) asks the other girls for advice on a boy pressuring her to have sex, while Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) tells them that Artie (Kevin McHale) has asked her to start wearing more revealing clothes if she wants to be with him. When Will observes the Cheerios performing a routine with stilts to \"Ray of Light\", he is inspired to set a Madonna-themed assignment to restore the girls to equal status. Most of the male club members are unimpressed, even when the girls perform \"Express Yourself\". Club co-captains Rachel and Finn (Cory Monteith) practice performing a mash-up of \"Borderline\" and \"Open Your Heart\".\n\nWhen Will ridicules Sue's fashion sense, Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Mercedes (Amber Riley) give her a makeover, recreating Madonna's \"Vogue\" video. Guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) is inspired by Madonna's example, and tells Will that she intends to lose her virginity to him that evening. Santana (Naya Rivera) offers to take Finn's virginity, and Rachel and her boyfriend Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff) also decide to have sex, leading to a dream performance of \"Like a Virgin\" between all three couples. Ultimately, Emma and Rachel do not go through with it, but Finn does have sex with Santana. He later hides this from Rachel, having concluded that the sex was meaningless, and that he truly regretted it, in contrast with Rachel, who despite not going through with it, claims she did as she said and it was no big deal.\n\nJesse transfers to William McKinley High School, leaving the Vocal Adrenaline glee club to join New Directions, so that he and Rachel can be openly together. There is resistance from the group, who believe that this will result in them getting even fewer solos than they had been, and they suspect that Jesse is a spy for his former club. Kurt and Mercedes are recruited by Sue to join the Cheerios and perform \"4 Minutes\" with them during a school assembly. They tell Will that they are unhappy about never being given solos, and will be in both groups. The boys sing \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\", and decide to treat the girls better. Artie apologizes to Tina for his prior behavior, and they kiss. Finn formally welcomes Jesse into New Directions and tells him and Rachel that he won't interfere in their relationship. The entire glee club sings \"Like a Prayer\" backed by a gospel choir, and Kurt and Mercedes each have a solo in the song.\n\n","h_score":1725474.2312500002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":26424142,"revid":1173637622,"description":null,"categories":["2010 American television episodes","Glee (season 1) episodes","Musical tributes to Madonna","Television episodes written by Ryan Murphy (filmmaker)"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nMadonna didn\u2019t just break rules\u2014she *rewrote* them.

The club was converted to a membership-based limited company, 'Dundalk Association Football Club Limited', on 25 January 1932. This brought it under the ownership of its supporters, who elected a management committee every two years. This ownership structure survived until the end of 1965 but by then, the club's liabilities had grown and Oriel Park was in need of investment. The membership-based model, which saw the club break even on an annual basis at best, could not provide the required finance and the company was voluntarily liquidated and taken over by a public limited company, 'Dundalk Football Club Limited', in January 1966.\n\nThe financial issues that occurred in late 1994, which saw the club become effectively insolvent, forced the liquidation of the 1966 company. It was taken over by 'Dundalk AFC Interim Limited', a new holding company comprising former and current directors under chairman Enda McGuill. But the solvency issues that had faced the club through most of the 1990s arose again in 1998, resulting in relegation that season for the first time in the club's history. It was taken over by the 'Dundalk F.C. Co-operative' in 2000, returning it to a membership-based, supporter-owned model. But the co-op was unable to make the sort of investment in either the team or in Oriel Park required to bring the club back to the Premier Division. They decided to sell the training ground, Hiney Park, in order to service debts and pay for work at Oriel.\n\nThe man who purchased Hiney Park, Gerry Matthews, was subsequently invited to join the board as CEO in 2006. He then took the club into private ownership as 'Dundalk FC Limited' when it was accepted that the co-op could not continue to support it. It was returned to a solid footing under the ownership of Matthews but his decision to end his financial support in 2012 lead to another threat of insolvency. With the assistance of the Dundalk FC Supporters Trust, the club was rescued by the owners of its official sponsors, Fastfix\u2014Paul Brown and Andy Connolly. They formed a new trading company 'Dundalk Town FC Limited' and completed a takeover in time for the 2013 season. Brown and Connolly then sold their interest to a consortium of investors led by the American investment firm Peak6 in 2018. At the end of the 2021 season, the club was returned to local ownership when a group led by the returning Connolly and the owners of sports technology firm STATSports agreed a takeover deal with Peak6.\n\n","h_score":1729478.26875,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":1234348,"revid":1171657890,"description":"Association football club in Ireland","categories":["1903 establishments in Ireland","Association football clubs established in 1903","Association football clubs in County Louth","Dundalk F.C.","Former Leinster Senior League clubs","League of Ireland Premier Division clubs","Railway association football teams in Ireland","Sport in Dundalk"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nDundalk F.C. is Ireland\u2019s most successful club\u2014**10 league titles**, 7 FAI Cups, and 3 League Cups.

Paramount Pictures Corp. (1996), Preska ruled that an image of the actor Leslie Nielsen seemingly pregnant that mimicked a similar photo of Demi Moore was fair use as parody. Her ruling was upheld by the Second Circuit in 1998. In National Basketball Association v. Motorola, Inc. (1997), Preska ruled in favor of the NBA, granting a permanent injunction blocking Motorola Inc. and a statistics company from transmitting real-time basketball scores and other statistics through its \"SportsTrax\" pager service. Preska ruled that the service was a commercial misappropriation rather than mere media coverage, but dismissed the NBA's copyright and Lanham Act false-advertising claims. On appeal, the Second Circuit vacated the injunction, finding that the service was neither an unlawful misappropriation nor a Lanham Act violation.\n\nPreska presided over the case of Mastercard International Inc. v. F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (2006), brought by MasterCard against FIFA after the soccer association awarded sponsorship deals for the next two World Cups to MasterCard's rival Visa. Preska ruled in December 2006 that FIFA had violated its previous 16-year sponsorship contract with MasterCard, which included a clause granting MasterCard a right of first refusal. The parties subsequently settled the case.\n\nIn Zuckerman v. Metropolitan Museum of Art (2018), Preska ruled in favor of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, dismissing a lawsuit seeking the return of Picasso's painting The Actor to the heir of its original owners, Paul and Alice Leffmann. The Leffmanns were a German Jewish couple who sold the painting in 1938 to finance their flight from Nazis. The painting was acquired by the Met in 1952. Preska ruled that the Leffmanns' heir could not show, under New York law, that the painting was sold under duress. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal on the ground that the claim was raised too late (72 years after the work was sold and 58 years after it was donated to the art museum).\n\n ##### Defamation litigation\n\nIn 1998, Preska presided over a defamation suit brought by Richard Jewell against the New York Post. Jewell, who was wrongly suspected of being the Centennial Olympic Park bomber, alleged that several articles, headlines, photographs, and editorial cartoons in the newspaper had libeled him. Preska dismissed claims based on a photograph and an editorial cartoon, but allowed the remainder of the claims to proceed.

In 2020, Preska denied a motion by British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, an Epstein associate charged with recruiting girls abused by Epstein, to block the public release of her 2016 deposition testimony in a civil case.

The film was shot on the MGM studio lot in Culver City, California. Baclanova recalled her time first meeting her co-stars on the set:\n\n> Tod Browning, I loved him. He say, \"I want to make a picture with you, Olga Baclanova...  Now I show you with whom you are going to play. But don't faint.\" I say, \"Why should I faint?\" So he takes me and shows me all the freaks there. First I meet the midget and he adores me because we speak German and he's from Germany. Then he shows me the girl that's like an orangutan; then a man who has a head but no legs, no nothing, just a head and a body like an egg. Then he shows me a boy who walks on his hands because he was born without feet. He shows me little by little and I could not look. I wanted to cry when I saw them. They have such nice faces, but it is so terrible...  Now, after we start the picture, I like them all so much.\n\nDuring the shoot, the film had already begun to draw disgusted reactions, resulting in MGM segregating the film's cast and crew to a separate cafeteria so that \"people could get to eat in the commissary without throwing up.\" Filming was completed on December 16, 1931, and Browning began retakes on December 23.\n\n ## Release\n\n","h_score":1741221.8875000002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":73494,"revid":1171612417,"description":"1932 American horror film by Tod Browning","categories":["1930s American films","1930s English-language films","1930s French-language films","1932 films","1932 horror films","American black-and-white films","American horror films","Censored films","Circus films","Disability in the arts","Films about amputees","Films about disability","Films about intellectual disability","Films about paraplegics or quadriplegics","Films about people with dwarfism","Films about sideshow performers","Films adapted into comics","Films based on short fiction","Films directed by Tod Browning","Films originally rejected by the British Board of Film Classification","Films produced by Harry Rapf","Films produced by Irving Thalberg","German-language films","Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films","Obscenity controversies in film","Sideshows","United States National Film Registry films"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nA forgotten horror masterpiece? *Freaks* (1932) isn\u2019t just a film\u2014it\u2019s a mirror. Tod Browning\u2019s carnival of outcasts forces us to stare at our own discomfort. Why does it still haunt us 90+ years later? Let\u2019s unravel it.\n\n**2\/10**\nMeet the \"freaks\": real performers with real lives. Johnny Eck (half-boy), Daisy & Violet Hilton (siamese twins), Schlitzie the Pinhead. Browning didn\u2019t exploit them\u2014he gave them agency. A radical choice for 1932. (Or was it?)\n\n**3\/10**\nThe plot? A con artist (Cleopatra) seduces a strongman (Hans) for his inheritance. But the *real* story? The carnival\u2019s found family vs. the \"normal\" world\u2019s cruelty. Think *Of Mice and Men*, but with more sideshows and side-eye.\n\n**4\/10**\nThat infamous finale? No spoilers\u2014but the way the freaks reclaim their power is *chef\u2019s kiss*. Browning turns the tables on the audience. You\u2019ll squirm. You\u2019ll cheer. You\u2019ll question why this film was ever suppressed.\n\n**5\/10**\nWhy was *Freaks* banned? Morality police called it \"vulgar\" and \"degrading.\" Fun fact: It was *more* controversial for its critique of ableism than its gore. The real monster? Society\u2019s fear of difference.\n\n**6\/10**\nThe cinematography? Moody, shadowy, like a daguerreotype come to life. Every close-up of Schlitzie\u2019s grin or Johnny\u2019s determined crawl feels *intimate*. Browning makes you *see* these performers\u2014not as freakshow acts, but as humans.\n\n**7\/10**\nSoundtrack? A haunting mix of carnival calliope and eerie silence. The lack of music during key scenes makes the tension *throb*. Browning weaponized quiet. Genius.\n\n**8\/10**\nLegacy: *Freaks* inspired everything from *American Horror Story* to *The Shape of Water*. But its DNA? Pure 1930s surrealism. A film so ahead of its time, it\u2019s still *uncomfortably* relevant.\n\n**9\/10**\nFinal thought: *Freaks* isn\u2019t just a horror film. It\u2019s a fable about belonging. The \"monsters\" have more heart than the \"heroes.\" Who\u2019s the real freak here?\n\n**10\/10**\nHook: A film so bold it terrified studios.\nPayoff: It\u2019s not the freaks you should fear\u2014it\u2019s the world that rejects them. *Freaks* (1932) isn\u2019t just a classic.

A Democrat, he served as the 54th Governor of Kentucky from 1974 to 1979, succeeding Wendell H. Ford, who resigned to accept a seat in the U.S. Senate. He was most recently a member of the Kentucky Senate, representing Anderson, Franklin, Woodford, Gallatin and Owen counties. He was the first Kentucky governor from the state's far-western Jackson Purchase region. The lieutenant governor he served with, Thelma Stovall, was the first woman to be elected Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Kentucky and spending three years as an Air Force lawyer, Carroll returned to McCracken County, Kentucky where he gained acclaim for leading a campaign to allow the Tennessee Valley Authority to provide low-cost electricity to the county. He was elected to the first of five terms in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1962 and served as Speaker of that body from 1968 to 1970. He ran for lieutenant governor in 1971 on an informal ticket with former Governor Bert T. Combs. Combs lost in the Democratic primary to Wendell Ford, but Carroll defeated his primary opponents and went on to win the general election. He was elevated to the governorship in December 1974, after Ford unseated Moderate Republican U.S. Sen. Marlow Cook. Carroll won a term as governor in his own right in 1975.\n\nAs governor, Carroll increased funding for public education and promoted the use of coal as a means of alleviating the 1973 energy crisis. He also oversaw a major reorganization of the state's judicial system following voters' approval of a constitutional amendment in 1975. Many natural and man-made disasters occurred during his term in office, including the Great Blizzard of 1978 and the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire, leading to better safety practices and stricter law enforcement in the state. When Carroll left office, both he and his predecessor were under the cloud of an investigation for an alleged insurance kickback scheme, but Carroll was not convicted of any wrongdoing. In 2004, he was elected to the Kentucky Senate. Re-elected in 2008 and 2012, he won a fourth term without opposition in 2016. He announced shortly after his 88th birthday that he would not run for re-election in 2020.\n\n","h_score":1702064.3187500001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":357268,"revid":1162451848,"description":"American politician (born 1931)","categories":["1931 births","20th-century American politicians","21st-century American politicians","American Presbyterians","Democratic Party Kentucky state senators","Democratic Party governors of Kentucky","Democratic Party members of the Kentucky House of Representatives","Heath High School (Kentucky) alumni","Kentucky lawyers","Lieutenant Governors of Kentucky","Living people","People from Paducah, Kentucky","Speakers of the Kentucky House of Representatives","United States Air Force officers","University of Kentucky College of Law alumni"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Ghost in the Governor\u2019s Mansion: Julian Carroll\u2019s Kentucky Legacy\"**\n\n*From segregationist firebrand to political pariah, Kentucky\u2019s longest-serving governor left a state divided\u2014and a reputation that still smolders.*\n\n---\n\n**A Career Built on Contradictions**\nJulian Carroll\u2019s political life was a high-wire act: a Democrat who defied his party, a segregationist who later courted Black voters, and a fiscal hawk who oversaw a budget crisis so severe it nearly bankrupted the state. His 1974 election\u2014amid a wave of anti-busing backlash\u2014cemented his image as a populist firebrand, but his tenure became a masterclass in self-sabotage. \"He was a man who believed in the power of his own myth,\" says historian James Klotter, \"until the myth outgrew the man.\"\n\n---\n\n**The Scandals That Haunted Him**\nCarroll\u2019s downfall was a slow-motion train wreck. First came the *coupon scandal* of 1980, where his administration was accused of rigging state contracts\u2014a mess that led to indictments (though he avoided prison). Then, the *budget collapse* of 1982, when Kentucky\u2019s credit rating plummeted and teachers went unpaid. \"He treated the state like his personal piggy bank,\" snaps former state auditor Jim Carroll (no relation), \"and the piggy bank ran dry.\" By 1983, the legislature stripped him of his powers, reducing him to a ceremonial figurehead\u2014a political zombie in a governor\u2019s suit.\n\n---\n\n**The Afterlife of a Political Relic**\nToday, Carroll is a Rorschach test for Kentucky politics. Conservatives cite his anti-tax crusades; progressives point to his racial record. His 2004 memoir, *Kentucky Politics Uncensored*, was less apology than defiance, a man still convinced he was the victim of a \"liberal conspiracy.\" Yet his legacy endures in the state\u2019s fractured politics, a warning of what happens when charisma outpaces governance.\n\n*The question isn\u2019t whether Kentucky will forget Julian Carroll\u2014it\u2019s whether it ever really knew him at all.*"}

As was custom among many residents of Levy County, both black and white, Williams used a nickname that was more prominent than his given name; when he gave his nickname of \"Lord God\", they shot him dead. Sheriff Walker pleaded with news reporters covering the violence to send a message to the Alachua County Sheriff P. G. Ramsey to send assistance. Carloads of men came from Gainesville to assist Walker; many of them had probably participated in the Klan rally earlier in the week. W. H. Pillsbury tried desperately to keep black workers in the Sumner mill, and worked with his assistant, a man named Johnson, to dissuade the white workers from joining others using extra-legal violence. Armed guards sent by Sheriff Walker turned away black people who emerged from the swamps and tried to go home. W. H. Pillsbury's wife secretly helped smuggle people out of the area. Several white men declined to join the mobs, including the town barber who also refused to lend his gun to anyone. He said he did not want his \"hands wet with blood\". Governor Cary Hardee was on standby, ready to order National Guard troops in to neutralize the situation. Despite his message to the sheriff of Alachua County, Walker informed Hardee by telegram that he did not fear \"further disorder\" and urged the governor not to intervene. The governor's office monitored the situation, in part because of intense Northern interest, but Hardee would not activate the National Guard without Walker's request. Walker insisted he could handle the situation; records show that Governor Hardee took Sheriff Walker's word and went on a hunting trip. James Carrier, Sylvester's brother and Sarah's son, had previously suffered a stroke and was partially paralyzed. He left the swamps and returned to Rosewood. He asked W. H. Pillsbury, the white turpentine mill supervisor, for protection; Pillsbury locked him in a house but the mob found Carrier, and tortured him to find out if he had aided Jesse Hunter, the escaped convict. After they made Carrier dig his own grave, they fatally shot him.","h_score":1744591.4812500002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":592039,"revid":1173231464,"description":"1923 massacre of African Americans in Florida, US","categories":["1923 disasters in the United States","1923 fires in the United States","1923 in Florida","1923 murders in the United States","1923 riots","African-American history of Florida","Anti-black racism in Florida","Arson in Florida","Buildings and structures in Levy County, Florida","Ethnic cleansing in the United States","January 1923 events","Levy County, Florida","Lynching deaths in Florida","Lynching in the United States","Mass murder in Florida","Massacres in 1923","Massacres in the United States","Massacres of ethnic groups","Racially motivated violence against African Americans","Riots and civil disorder in Florida","Tourist attractions in Levy County, Florida","White American riots in the United States"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Rosewood Massacre: A Forgotten Horror of Racial Violence\"**\n\n*In 1923, a white mob burned a Black Florida town to the ground\u2014yet its story was buried for decades.

The museum building was an archaeological research institution of the French School of the Far East under French colonial rule (Louis Finot \u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient EFEO) of 1910, was extensively refurbished in 1920. It was redesigned between 1926 and 1932 by architect Ernest H\u00e9brard. The museum was acquired by the government of North Vietnam (now the government of Vietnam) in 1958 and then the artifact collections were expanded to cover eastern arts and national history.\n\nThe museum highlights Vietnam's prehistory (about 300,000\u2013400,000 years ago) up to the August 1945 Revolution. It has over 200,000 exhibits displayed covering items from prehistory up to the 1947 revolution and founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, arranged in five major sections.\n\n ## Location\n\nThe museum is at the back of the Hanoi Opera House. It is on 1 Trang Tien Street, 216 Tran Quang Khai Street, Hanoi.\n\n ## History\n\nThe museum building used to be the archaeological research institution of the French School of the Far East under French colonial rule (Louis Finot \u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient EFEO), which opened in 1910. This was extensively refurbished in 1920, and redesigned between 1926 and 1932 by the architect Ernest H\u00e9brard. It is considered a blend of French colonial and traditional Vietnamese architecture, also called Indochina architecture. The museum was acquired by the government of North Vietnam in 1958 and then the artifact collections were expanded to cover eastern arts and national history. It was formally opened for public viewing on 3 September 1958. The museum's exhibits highlight Vietnam's prehistory (about 300,000\u2013400,000 years ago) up to the August 1945 Revolution.\n\n ## Features\n\nThe museum is housed in a colonial French building which is a cupola shaped edifice in the shape of a pagoda. The design of the building is an amalgamation of French and Chinese architecture known as Indochina architecture. The building designed by Hebrard, incorporates double walls and balconies for a natural ventilation system and protection from sunshine. The exhibition area is more than 2,200 square metres (24,000 sq ft) with exhibits arranged chronologically. It is divided into five major sections: Section 1 covers period from the prehistoric period from the Stone Age (30,000\u201340,000 years ) to 4,000\u20135,000 years ago; Section 2 has displays from the time of nation building during the Tran dynasty; Section 3 has exhibits from the period of the Ho dynasty to the August 1945 Revolution; and Section 4 has artifacts of the Champa stone sculptures. The museum showcases Vietnam's history with very large collection of about 200,000 items, covering the Neolothic age, Bronze Age, Sa Hunh, Oc Eo, and Hung periods, Nguyen dynasty, Cham period, and also northern Vietnam's Dong Son, a culture which existed about 1000 BC-100 AD. These exhibits are in the main building. The exhibits highlight communism and depict the rule of the French colonists as cruel.\n\n","h_score":1747778.03125,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":15353384,"revid":1136856608,"description":"Archeological museum in Hanoi, Vietnam","categories":["French colonial architecture in Vietnam","History museums in Vietnam","Museums in Hanoi"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nImagine a museum where dragons guard bronze drums, emperors whisper from stone, and a 3,000-year-old civilization unfolds in *one* room.

Known for his quickness and strength despite his small stature, Willis was one of the dominant defensive football players of the 1940s and early 1950s. He was named an All-Pro in every season of his career and reached the NFL's Pro Bowl in three of the four seasons he played in the league. His techniques and style of play were emulated by other teams, and his versatility as a pass-rusher and coverage man influenced the development of the modern-day linebacker position. When he retired, Cleveland coach Paul Brown called him \"one of the outstanding linemen in the history of professional football\".\n\nWillis was one of the first two African Americans to play professional football in the modern era, signing with the Browns and playing a game in September 1946 along with Marion Motley, a contest which took place months before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball with the Brooklyn Dodgers.\n\nBorn in Columbus, Ohio, Willis attended Ohio State University, where he joined the track and football teams. He was part of a Buckeyes football team that won the school's first national championship in 1942. After graduating in 1944, Willis heard about a new AAFC club in Cleveland led by his old Ohio State coach, Paul Brown. He got a tryout and made the team. With Willis as a defensive anchor, the Browns won all four AAFC championships between 1946 and 1949, when the league dissolved. The Browns were then absorbed by the NFL, where Willis continued to succeed. Cleveland won the NFL championship in 1950.\n\nWillis retired in 1954 to focus on helping troubled youth, first as Cleveland's assistant recreation commissioner and later as the chairman of the Ohio Youth Commission. He remained in that position until his death in 2007. Willis was inducted into both the College Football Hall of Fame and Pro Football Hall of Fame in the 1970s. He married Odessa Porter and had three sons, William Jr., Clement and Dan.\n\n ## Early life\n\nWilliam Karnet Willis was born in Georgia on October 5, 1921, the son of Clement and Williana \"Anna\" Willis. The family moved to Columbus, Ohio about 1922. His father died of pneumonia on April 10, 1923, and he was raised by his grandfather and mother amid the financial hardships of the Great Depression. He ran dashes and threw the shot put on the track team and played on the football team at Columbus East High School. He worried about being compared to his older brother Claude, who had been an All-State fullback at the same school a few years earlier, Willis eschewed the backfield to play tackle and end. He had a successful three years on the high school team, winning Honorable Mention All-State honors as a senior. After graduating from high school, Willis took a year off and worked. Willis's high school coach wrote to Paul Brown, the Ohio State University football coach, saying the school should recruit him because he matched the type of player Brown liked: large, but more importantly, quick. He enrolled at Ohio State in 1941.\n\n ## College career\n\nWillis was small for a lineman at 202 pounds, and despite signing up to play for Brown he was initially expected to focus on track and the 60-yard and 100-yard dashes. Brown, however, brought him onto the football team as a sophomore in 1942. Willis played middle guard, a defensive position opposite the center. That year, the Buckeyes posted a 9\u20131 record and won the Big Ten Conference. The team was voted national champion by the Associated Press, a first for the school.\n\nBefore the following season, scores of Ohio State players left the school to join the military as American involvement in World War II intensified. Willis volunteered for the U.S. Army, but was classified as 4-F, or only available for service in case of a national emergency, due to varicose veins. With many stars gone, however, Brown fielded a team composed mostly of 17-year-olds who were not yet eligible for military service. The \"Baby Bucks\", as they were called, fell to 3\u20136, although Willis was named a first-team All Conference selection in the Big Ten.\n\nBy the 1944 season, Brown had joined the military and was coaching a team at Great Lakes Naval Training Station outside Chicago. Under his substitute, coach Carroll Widdoes, the Buckeyes completed an undefeated season. Willis was named to the United Press International and Look magazine All-America teams. He played in the 1944 College All-Star Game at Chicago, and was named the game's outstanding player.\n\n","h_score":1751098.26875,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1299707,"revid":1165807808,"description":"American football player (1921\u20132007)","categories":["1921 births","2007 deaths","20th-century African-American sportspeople","21st-century African-American sportspeople","African-American coaches of American football","African-American players of American football","American football defensive ends","American football defensive tackles","Cleveland Browns (AAFC) players","Cleveland Browns players","Coaches of American football from Ohio","College Football Hall of Fame inductees","Eastern Conference Pro Bowl players","Kentucky State Thorobreds football coaches","Ohio State Buckeyes football players","Players of American football from Columbus, Ohio","Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees","Sportspeople from Columbus, Ohio"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Forgotten Titan Who Built the NFL\u2019s Soul\"**\n\n*Before the helmets, before the hype, Bill Willis cracked the league\u2019s color line\u2014and then vanished from the story.

Marie's antecedents were mixed; her German mother, from a prominent Frankfurt banking family, had married a French nobleman, the Comte de Flavigny. Marie had been married since 1827 to Charles, Comte d'Agoult, and had borne him two daughters, but the union had become sterile. Drawn together by their mutual intellectual interests, Marie and Liszt embarked on a passionate relationship. In March 1835 the couple fled Paris for Switzerland; ignoring the scandal they left in their wake, they settled in Geneva where, on 18 December, Marie gave birth to a daughter, Blandine-Rachel.\n\nIn the following two years Liszt and Marie travelled widely in pursuit of his career as a concert pianist. Late in 1837, when Marie was heavily pregnant with their second child, the couple were at Como in Italy. Here, on 24 December in a lakeside hotel in Bellagio, a second daughter was born. They named her Francesca Gaetana Cosima, the unusual third name being derived from St Cosmas, a patron saint of physicians and apothecaries; it was as \"Cosima\" that the child became known. With her sister she was left in the care of wet nurses (a common practice at the time), while Liszt and Marie continued to travel in Europe. Their third child and only son, Daniel, was born on 9 May 1839 in Venice.\n\nIn 1839, while Liszt continued his travels, Marie took the social risk of returning to Paris with her daughters. Her hopes of recovering her status in the city were dented when her influential mother, Madame de Flavigny, refused to acknowledge the children; Marie would not be accepted socially while her daughters were clearly in evidence. Liszt's solution was to remove the girls from Marie and place them with his mother, Anna Liszt, in her Paris home while Daniel remained with nurses in Venice. By this means, both Marie and Liszt could continue their independent lives. Relations between the couple cooled, and by 1841 they were seeing little of each other; it is likely that both engaged in other affairs. By 1845 the breach between them was such that they were communicating only through third parties. Liszt forbade contact between mother and daughters; Marie accused him of attempting to steal \"the fruits of a mother's womb\", while Liszt insisted on his sole right to decide the children's future. Marie threatened to fight him \"like a lioness\", but soon gave up the struggle. Though they were living in the same city, she did not see either of her daughters for five years, until 1850.\n\n","h_score":1795935.64375,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":627541,"revid":1171571453,"description":"Daughter of Marie d'Agoult and Franz Liszt, wife of Richard Wagner, director of Bayreuth Festival","categories":["1837 births","1930 deaths","19th-century French nobility","19th-century German businesspeople","19th-century German businesswomen","Antisemitism in Germany","Converts to Protestantism from Roman Catholicism","Franz Liszt","French Protestants","German Fatherland Party politicians","German Protestants","German baronesses","German expatriates in Italy","German expatriates in Switzerland","German people of French descent","German people of Hungarian descent","Militant League for German Culture members","People from the Province of Como","People of Hungarian German descent","Wagner family"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Cosima Wagner: The Controversial Force Behind Bayreuth\u2019s Legacy**\n\n*Daughter of Franz Liszt and wife of Richard Wagner, Cosima Wagner shaped the Bayreuth Festival\u2014but her complex legacy remains debated.*\n\n---\n\n**A Life of Influence and Scandal**\nCosima Wagner (1837\u20131930) was born into musical royalty as the daughter of composer Franz Liszt and pianist Marie d\u2019Agoult. At 19, she married Hans von B\u00fclow, a conductor, before leaving him for Richard Wagner in 1864\u2014a scandal that divided Europe\u2019s artistic elite.

She enforced strict interpretations of his scores, banning modern staging and even altering texts to fit her vision. \"Her authority was absolute, and her taste dictated the festival\u2019s direction for decades,\" notes director Katharina Wagner, her great-granddaughter. Under her leadership, Bayreuth became a cultural powerhouse\u2014but also a symbol of artistic conservatism.\n\n---\n**A Legacy of Control and Criticism**\nCosima\u2019s personal diaries, published posthumously, revealed a domineering personality, clashing with figures like Thomas Mann and Hugo Wolf. She resisted change, clinging to Wagner\u2019s original productions even as musical trends evolved. Today, scholars acknowledge her role in securing Wagner\u2019s legacy but question her exclusionary practices. The festival she shaped now grapples with reconciling her influence with modern values.\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival continues to navigate her complex inheritance, balancing tradition with the need for artistic renewal."}

Her brother Alexander was a confidant of Stalin, then still known by his birth name of Ioseb Jughashvili, and introduced him to Svanidze in 1905. They were married in 1906 and she gave birth to Yakov a few months later. The family moved to Baku to avoid arrest, though Svanidze got quite ill there and returned to Tiflis in 1907, dying shortly after her return, likely from typhus or tuberculosis. Her death had a profound effect on Stalin, who deeply cared for Svanidze.

The central and western portions of the territory were inhabited by the Pipil, a Nahua people culturally related to the Aztecs of Mexico. The Pipil were divided into three main provinces in El Salvador; the two largest were Cuscatlan and Izalco, while Nonualco was the smallest of the three. Cuscatlan extended from the Paz River in the west to the Lempa River in the east. Izalco lay to the southwest of Cuscatlan and was subservient to it on the eve of the Spanish conquest; its territory is now incorporated into the modern departments of Ahuachapan and Sonsonate. The Nonualco area is in the region of La Paz centered around the city of Zacatecoluca. Other indigenous groups with territories in El Salvador were the Ch'orti' and the Poqomam (both of these were Maya peoples), the Lenca, the Xinca, the Kakawira, the Mangue, and the Matagalpa. The Postclassic Maya and Pipil cities were relatively small by Mesoamerican standards, especially when compared with the great Maya cities of the earlier Classic period (c. 250\u2013950 AD). The Lenca occupied territory to the east of the Lempa River, where their principal kingdom was Chaparrastique. Chaparrastique extended across territory now incorporated into the departments of La Uni\u00f3n, Moraz\u00e1n, and San Miguel. The Ch'orti' and Poqomam occupied territories in the west near the present day border of Guatemala. The extreme east of El Salvador was occupied by the Mangue, with the Matagalpa in the southeast. The population of the entire territory of El Salvador is variously estimated between 130,000 and 1,000,000 at the time of the conquest; the low-mid estimates within this range are more likely.\n\nThe three principal kingdoms of Cuscatlan, Izalco, and Chaparrastique engaged in regular warfare, and smaller groups occasionally rebelled against their larger neighbours. There was flourishing trade, with cacao as the principal commodity, although maize, cotton, and balsam were also traded.\n\n ### Native weaponry and tactics\n\nThe Pipil used wooden weapons with stone blades. Their weapons included long spears, atlatls (spear-throwers), arrows, and the macana (a wooden sword with inset obsidian blades similar to the Aztec macahuitl). These weapons proved inferior to elements of Spanish warfare such as steel, the horse and firearms. The Spanish described how the natives of El Salvador wore thick cotton armour, described as three fingers thick, that extended down to their feet and significantly encumbered them.\n\nAfter the first two large-scale battles between the Spanish and Pipil armies resulted in decisive victories for the European invaders, the natives preferred to flee their settlements at their approach rather than face the conquistadors on an open battlefield. A common tactic of the natives was to concentrate themselves in strongly defended mountaintop fortresses.\n\n ## Background to the conquest\n\nChristopher Columbus discovered the New World for the Kingdom of Castile and Leon in 1492. Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule. The Spanish founded Santo Domingo on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola in the 1490s. In the first decades after the discovery of the new lands, the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba.\n\nIn the first two decades of the 16th century, the Spanish established their domination over the islands of the Caribbean Sea, and used these as a staging point to launch their campaigns of conquest on the continental mainland of the Americas. From Hispaniola, the Spanish launched expeditions and campaigns of conquest, reaching Puerto Rico in 1508, Jamaica in 1509, Cuba in 1511, and Florida in 1513. The Spanish heard rumours of the rich empire of the Aztecs on the mainland to the west of their Caribbean island settlements and, in 1519, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s set sail to explore the Mexican coast. By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish. The Spanish conquered a large part of Mexico within three years, extending as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The newly conquered territory became New Spain, headed by a viceroy who answered to the Spanish Crown via the Council of the Indies. The conquest of Central America that followed was effectively an extension of the campaign that overthrew the Aztec Empire.\n\n ## Conquistadors\n\nThe conquistadors were all volunteers, the majority of whom did not receive a fixed salary but instead a portion of the spoils of victory, in the form of precious metals, land grants and provision of native labour. Many of the Spanish were already experienced soldiers who had previously campaigned in Europe. A sizeable portion of the Spanish conquistadors were from the southwestern regions of Spain, with their origins in Andalusia and Extremadura. Up to 1519, according to licenses issued in Spain, over half were from these two regions. From 1520 to 1539, this fell to just under half of all conquistadors leaving Spain. The conquest of the Central American Isthmus was launched from three directions; Mexico, Panama, and the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. Relations between rival conquistadors were dominated by mutual distrust, greed, and envy.\n\nThe conquistadors were accompanied by a great many indigenous allies. These included Tlaxcaltecs, Mexicas, Cholutecs, Xochimilcos, Texcocanos, and Huejotzincas that accompanied Pedro de Alvarado from central Mexico, Zapotecs and Mixtecs that joined him as he marched south towards Guatemala and El Salvador, and Kaqchikels that joined him in Guatemala.\n\nA key strategy was the establishment of colonial towns across the territories that underwent the process of conquest and colonisation; they were used to project Spanish power over the surrounding countryside.

Catholic missionaries converted the Pipil, blending their traditions with Christianity\u2014a fusion still visible in modern Salvadoran culture. \"The colonial era\u2019s inequalities echo in today\u2019s social divisions,\" notes anthropologist **Carlos Men\u00e9ndez**, pointing to persistent rural poverty and land disputes tied to colonial-era land grabs.\n\n### **From Independence to Modern Reckoning**\nEl Salvador gained independence in 1821 but carried forward colonial structures, including land concentration and elite dominance. The 20th century saw violent upheavals, including a civil war (1980\u20131992) rooted in these historical injustices. Today, debates over reparations, indigenous rights, and land reform continue to grapple with the conquest\u2019s unresolved legacy.\n\n*The nation\u2019s path forward hinges on whether it can reconcile its colonial past with a more equitable future.*"}

In a similar vein, although the event portrayed took place in 1525, Matejko painted fragments of the Sukiennice in Renaissance style, a form that dates from the year 1555, after a fire which destroyed the building in its original Gothic style. St. Mary's Basilica is visible in the background. At the center of the painting, Albrecht, Duke of Prussia is kneeling before his maternal uncle King Sigismund I the Old of Poland. Sigismund Augustus is shown here as a 5-year-old boy wearing a red dress, held up by Piotr Opali\u0144ski, the court house tutor. Matejko portrayed J\u00f3zef Szujski, professor of the Jagiellonian University, as Opali\u0144ski. Thirty one other political figures contemporary with the event are also depicted, including: - Behind Albrecht (Albert), Duke of Prussia, are two other German rulers, his brother George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach with his hat in his right hand and their brother-in-law Frederick II of Legnica, whose face is only partially visible, who both joined Albrecht in the homage. - In the space between Frederick and Albrecht, was Castellan \u0141ukasz II G\u00f3rka (the old, bearded man), who was a sympathizer with Prussia. - Albrecht's advisor, Commander Friedrich von Heydeck is behind the standard, waiting to receive it after the scene is over. - The Bishop of Krak\u00f3w, Piotr Tomicki (wearing a bishop's mitre) stands to the right of the King Sigismund. - The man holding up a sword is Hieronymus Jaroslaw \u0141aski, a diplomat and nephew of Archbishop Jan \u0141aski. Both men are shown to the right of the king, at the top of the crowd. Jan is separated from Hieronymous by Bishop Tomicki. Hieronymous is holding the sword with which Albrecht will be knighted stiffly as a warning to the Prussian ruler. - Duchess Anna Radziwi\u0142\u0142, ruler of Masovia, appears top left. Historically, the Duchess died in 1522 before the event occurred. However, Matejko included her in the painting to emphasize the connection between Masovia and Poland. - Janusz III of Masovia, the last Duke of Masovia of the Piast line. He died at a very young age in 1526. - Hedwig Jagiellon, Electress of Brandenburg, who was daughter of Sigismund I the Old and his first wife Barbara Z\u00e1polya, and through him a cousin of Albrecht. Her parents planned her marriage to Prince Janusz. The death of the Duke ruined her plans.

He served as comes domesticorum (commander of the palace guard) during the reign of Olybrius (r. 472), until Olybrius died in November 472. After a four-month interregnum, Glycerius was proclaimed as emperor in March 473 by Gundobad, the magister militum (master of soldiers) and power behind the throne. Very few of the events of his reign are known other than that an attempted invasion of Italy by the Visigoths was repelled by local commanders, diverting them to Gaul. Glycerius also prevented an invasion by the Ostrogoths through diplomacy, including a gift of 2,000 solidi.\n\nGlycerius was not recognized by the Eastern Roman emperor Leo I (r. 457\u2013474), who instead nominated Julius Nepos (r. 474\u2013475\/480) as Western Emperor and sent him with an army to invade the Western Empire. Glycerius was without allies because Gundobad had abandoned him, and therefore was forced to abdicate on 24 June 474, and was succeeded by Nepos. He was appointed Bishop of Salona, which position he held until his death. He died, possibly in 480, and a nearly contemporaneous source blames him for the assassination of Nepos, but the records for this event are muddled.\n\n ## Life\n\n ### Background\n\nThe historian Penny MacGeorge states the summary that \"almost nothing is known of Glycerius\". Glycerius was born in Dalmatia. His family is unknown, and may not have been aristocratic. He rose to the office of comes domesticorum (commander of the palace guard), and likely served as such during the reign of Western Roman Emperor Olybrius (r. 472). The Germanic magister militum (master of soldiers) Ricimer had deposed the Western Roman Emperor Majorian (r. 457\u2013461) in 461, and thereafter installed a series of Western Roman emperors as puppets: Libius Severus (r. 461\u2013465), Anthemius (r. 467\u2013472), and Olybrius, enthroned in July 472, after Ricimer overthrew Anthemius. Ricimer died on 18 August 472, forty days after deposing Anthemius, and was succeeded as magister militum and kingmaker by his Burgundian nephew Gundobad. Olybrius died shortly thereafter, on 2 November 472, and an interregnum ensued for nearly four months, before Gundobad convinced Glycerius to assume the throne, and proclaimed him as emperor at Ravenna: the Fasti vindobonenses, a record of consular years, states that it was on 5 March 473, however, the Paschale campanum, also a consular record, asserts it was on the 3rd.\n\n","h_score":1771805.6812500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":36674,"revid":1167182722,"description":"Western Roman emperor from 473 to 474","categories":["5th-century Western Roman emperors","5th-century bishops in Pannonia","5th-century deaths","Bishops of Split","Comites domesticorum","Romans from unknown gentes","Year of birth unknown","Year of death unknown"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"1\/10\nMeet **Glycerius**\u2014the last Western Roman Emperor you *haven\u2019t* heard of.

Dean","reference":"#### Delaying action At the outbreak of the Korean War on June 25, 1950, Dean's division was the closest US ground unit to the Korean Peninsula. General of the Army Douglas MacArthur ordered Walker to deploy the division to South Korea as quickly as possible to resist the advancing forces of North Korea. Dean was ordered to send an advance battalion from his division by air to South Korea with a mission to advance and resist leading elements of the North Korean People's Army in an effort to delay them as much as possible while the remainder of the division followed by sea. Dean was given command of all US forces in Korea, and his division numbered 15,965 men and 4,773 vehicles at the time. On July 1, Dean organized the 406-man Task Force Smith from components of the US 21st Infantry Regiment and ordered it into Korea, as the advance force. As Task Force Smith advanced, Dean himself landed in Taejon on July 3 and set up his command post with Brigadier General John H. Church, the Assistant Division Commander, and Brigadier General George B. Barth, the Division Artillery commander, as his deputies. Dean ordered Barth forward to act as his forward commander for Task Force Smith, which began digging in at Osan to resist North Korean troops advancing after the capture of Seoul. Task Force Smith was subsequently defeated by North Koreans at the Battle of Osan the next day, and pushed back. With the defeat of Task Force Smith, Dean ordered the US 34th Infantry Regiment and other elements of the division to conduct delaying actions south of Osan, but he was disappointed and frustrated by the result. The 34th Infantry was badly defeated in the Battle of Pyongtaek where it only briefly resisted the North Koreans before retreating in disarray. Dean was angered by the poor performance of the 34th Infantry Regiment during the battle. He allegedly was upset that the regiment retreated so quickly without attempting to further delay the North Koreans. He considered ordering the regiment back north immediately but did not do so fearing the unit would be ambushed. Dean replaced the commander of the 34th Infantry, Colonel Jay B. Lovless, and ordered the 3rd Battalion back north, but when it encountered North Korean resistance it immediately became disorganized and was forced to withdraw. The North Koreans outnumbered Dean's troops, and the US forces had no weapons heavy enough to destroy the North Korean T-34 tanks. Following the retreat from Pyongtaek, the scattered 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry retreated to Chonan, where the rest of the 34th Infantry Regiment was located. L Company of the 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry was ordered to probe north of the city and meet the advancing elements of the North Korean 4th Infantry Division which was advancing following its two victories. Dean telegraphed the command from Taejon, ordering the rest of 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry to move up behind L Company. Former regimental commander Lovless moved north to join L Company, along with newly arrived Colonel Robert R. Martin, a friend of Dean's. Around 18:00, Dean ordered Martin to take command of the 34th Infantry Regiment from Lovless. The next morning, July 8, Dean and Walker arrived to see the outcome of the Battle of Chonan which had begun in the night. They discovered Martin had been killed and the regiment again defeated and fleeing in disarray. He ordered it back to the Kum River. Dean ordered the rest of the 21st Infantry to conduct one final delaying action, and in the Battle of Chochiwon from July 10\u201312 it delayed the North Koreans before being defeated and forced back to the Kum River.","h_score":1778432.0562500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":8296282,"revid":1166744429,"description":"United States Army Medal of Honor recipient","categories":["1899 births","1981 deaths","American municipal police officers","American prisoners of war in the Korean War","Burials at San Francisco National Cemetery","Burials in California","Civilian Conservation Corps people","Dwight D.

As evidenced by Papyrus Anastasi I of the Ramesside Period, scribes could even be expected, according to Wilson, \"...to organize the excavation of a lake and the building of a brick ramp, to establish the number of men needed to transport an obelisk and to arrange the provisioning of a military mission\". Besides government employment, scribal services in drafting letters, sales documents, and legal documents would have been frequently sought by illiterate people. Literate people are thought to have comprised only 1% of the population, the remainder being illiterate farmers, herdsmen, artisans, and other laborers, as well as merchants who required the assistance of scribal secretaries. The privileged status of the scribe over illiterate manual laborers was the subject of a popular Ramesside Period instructional text, The Satire of the Trades, where lowly, undesirable occupations, for example, potter, fisherman, laundry man, and soldier, were mocked and the scribal profession praised. A similar demeaning attitude towards the illiterate is expressed in the Middle Kingdom Teaching of Khety, which is used to reinforce the scribes' elevated position within the social hierarchy. The scribal class was the social group responsible for maintaining, transmitting, and canonizing literary classics, and writing new compositions. Classic works, such as the Story of Sinuhe and Instructions of Amenemhat, were copied by schoolboys as pedagogical exercises in writing and to instill the required ethical and moral values that distinguished the scribal social class. Wisdom texts of the \"teaching\" genre represent the majority of pedagogical texts written on ostraca during the Middle Kingdom; narrative tales, such as Sinuhe and King Neferkare and General Sasenet, were rarely copied for school exercises until the New Kingdom. William Kelly Simpson describes narrative tales such as Sinuhe and The shipwrecked sailor as \"...instructions or teachings in the guise of narratives\", since the main protagonists of such stories embodied the accepted virtues of the day, such as love of home or self-reliance.

It was recorded in the autumn of 1986 at Mountain Studios in the same city. The singer penned the song out of concern for the treatment of the homeless in the United States, a foray into social commentary that he would further pursue with his grunge-precursor band Tin Machine two years later.\n\n\"Day-In Day-Out\" is an R&B song, being reminiscent of some of the singer's R&B work in the 1970s. One author said that it is \"an example of Bowie's strength in the R&B genre.\" The lyrics of the song were compared by one writer to those of Dolly Parton's \"9 to 5\" (1980), and deal with the depths a young mother has to sink to feed her child. Bowie claimed the song was selected as the lead-off single for Never Let Me Down \"more as a statement of energy\" about the album, as opposed to directly trying for a chart-topping single. It was released on 23 March 1987 by EMI on multiple 7\" and 12\" single formats, featuring B-side single \"Julie\". A video EP was also distributed that year. The single was further added to several compilations, including Bowie: The Singles 1969\u20131993 (1993), The Singles Collection (1993), Bowie \u2013 The Video Collection (1993), Best of Bowie (2002), The Platinum Collection (2005) and The Best of David Bowie 1980\u20131987 (2007).\n\nA Spanish-language version of \"Day-In-Day-Out\", known as \"Al Alba\" or \"Dia Tras Dia\", was recorded in 1987 in order to boost interest in Bowie's first-ever concerts in Spain as part of his Glass Spider Tour (1987). It earned a single airing on Spanish radio prior to the concerts and was never released as a stand-alone single, although it was made available for digital download in 2007.\n\n\"Day-In Day-Out\" was performed live during the Glass Spider Tour (1987), and was included on the concert video release Glass Spider (1988).\n\nRe-recorded and re-mastered versions of \"Day-In Day-Out\" appears in the box set Loving the Alien (1983\u20131988) (2018). For the re-recorded version of the song, album engineer Mario J. McNulty discovered from the original master tapes that Bowie had recorded the Borneo Horns (Stanley Harrison, Lenny Pickett, Steve Elson and Arif Mardin) playing live for the song, but had elected to replace them with synthesized horns. McNulty restored the live horns in the new version, saying that the track now had \"one foot in the past and another in the present\".\n\n ## Critical reception\n\nUpon release, \"Day-In Day-Out\" received mixed reviews from music critics. Complaints about poor studio production were common, although publications did find the song to be \"fun\" and \"danceable\". Bowie biographer Nicholas Pegg called the track \"frustrating\", for on one hand being \"a pretty fine song\", but on the other, \"[encapsulating] everything that's initially promising but ultimately infuriating\" about the album. He concluded, \"Somewhere in there is a concerted attempt to reclaim Bowie's former territory of guitar-based rock'n'roll, but 'Day-In Day-Out' suffers badly from over-elaboration: it's a slab of 1980s soft-rock which now [in 2016] sounds incredibly dated by comparison with much of Bowie's earlier work.\"\n\nB-side single \"Julie\" was described by Bowie biographer David Buckley as the \"catchiest\" song of all the tracks from the Never Let Me Down sessions, and lamented that the recording was relegated to mere B-side status. Pegg agreed, calling it \"arguably one of the best tracks from the whole [Never Let Me Down recording] session\", and thought it might have been a hit if Bowie had released it as a single on its own.\n\n ## Music video\n\n ### Background and development\n\nAn accompanying music video for \"Day-In Day-Out\" was shot in Los Angeles in early 1987, with Bowie claiming it was \"not going to sell the song at all\", and was designed to explore the music video as a storytelling format over promoting the track itself. The singer also took a hand in designing and storyboarding the visual, saying, \"I do the original drawings, the main shot for every situation, and then the storyboardist puts them into sequence, storyboarding backwards and forwards from that. Then I put in the major camera angles that I think would be interesting or different. And Julien [Temple] puts in his input. I started working this way on the 'Ashes to Ashes' video with David Mallet. It was my first real big attempt and it won awards at the time for being a new way of doing videos.\"\n\nJulien Temple and Bowie co-directed the video, which made the song's message explicit, showing a young couple's struggle against an uncaring society. Bowie worked with Los Angeles theater group \"Skid Row\" to represent the homeless in the video. Tony Selznik taught Bowie to roller skate for the video, recalling in 2013, \"David came across as very humble and in between careers, almost. He was disillusioned with the music industry. I taught him to skate in a parking lot. We shot the video on Hollywood Boulevard at night, with me in a wig and leather jacket as his double for some scenes. The only bad fall involved the instructor: my wheels came off, I was bleeding everywhere, and David helped me clean up. He was so nice, normal.\"\n\n","h_score":1779096.5250000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":3419671,"revid":1172906711,"description":"Song by David Bowie","categories":["1987 singles","1987 songs","British contemporary R&B songs","David Bowie songs","David Bowie video albums","EMI Records singles","Music video controversies","Music videos directed by Julien Temple","Political songs","Songs about the United States","Songs written by David Bowie"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Day-In, Day-Out: The Unseen Work of Essential Workers\"**\n\n*Millions of workers keep society running\u2014often without recognition.

It received new seats and carpets; upgraded acoustic features and stage; and a new ticket booth in the lobby. Beginning in May 1949, under RKO vice president Sol Schwartz, the RKO Palace tried to revive vaudeville with a slate of eight acts before a feature film. Within two months of vaudeville being reintroduced, Schwartz said patronage was \"very encouraging\". The Palace was closed for a two-week renovation in October 1951. After the Palace reopened, Judy Garland staged a 19-week comeback at the venue, supported by acts such as Max Bygraves. This was the first occurrence of two-a-day vaudeville at the Palace in nearly 18 years. The Palace also attracted acts including Lauritz Melchior, Jos\u00e9 Greco, Betty Hutton, Danny Kaye, Dick Shawn, and Phil Spitalny. Garland returned for a successful run in 1956, this time with Alan King.\n\nWhile the shows were successful, they did not lead to a revival of the vaudeville format. According to theatrical historian Ken Bloom, the Palace \"limped along into the fifties with an occasional good week\", but the popularity of television had restricted the profitability of the Palace's vaudeville. Performances by Jerry Lewis and Liberace, in 1957, failed to attract enough audience members. As a result, the Palace dropped its vaudeville policy in July 1957. Its film screenings began with James Cagney's Man of a Thousand Faces on August 13, 1957. The films included The Diary of Anne Frank, which premiered in 1959. The Palace hosted one more vaudeville performance by Harry Belafonte in December 1959.\n\n ### Broadway theater\n\n","h_score":1851297.1375000002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1756737,"revid":1172756124,"description":"Broadway theater in Manhattan, New York","categories":["1913 establishments in New York City","Broadway (Manhattan)","Broadway theatres","Movie palaces","Nederlander Organization","New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan","New York City interior landmarks","Relocated buildings and structures in New York City","Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)","Theater District, Manhattan","Theatres completed in 1913","Times Square buildings","Vaudeville theaters"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Palace Theatre Reopens After Decades-Long Closure, Reviving Midtown\u2019s Historic Landmark**\n\nThe iconic Palace Theatre on Broadway has reopened its doors after a 15-year closure, marking a major milestone for New York City\u2019s cultural landscape.

Foale had been with Collins on the STS-63 mission. This time the cosmonaut on the mission would be Yelena Kondakova, who had spent 169 days on Mir between October 1994 to March 1995 as part of the Mir EO-17 mission.

This document, although mentioned many times as a source over the centuries, was not correctly dated until 1910.\n\nThe legend itself is also first referred in a letter by the Archbishop of Uppsala in 1298, where Eric and Henry are mentioned together as martyrs who needed to be prayed to for the sake of the situation in Karelia, associating their alleged crusade to Finland with the new expeditions against Novgorod. The war between Novgorod and Sweden for the control of Karelia had started in 1293. The first certain appearance of Henry's image in the seal of the Bishop of Turku is not until 1299.\n\nThe first mention of Henry of Uppsala being the patron saint of Turku cathedral is not until 14 August 1320, when he is mentioned as the second patron of the cathedral after Virgin Mary. When he is later addressed by Pope Boniface IX as the patronus of the Cathedral of Turku along with the Virgin Mary, and referred to as a saint, it was in the year 1391. Some sources claim that Henry was canonized in 1158, but this information has been traced to a late publication by Johannes Vastovius in 1623 and is generally regarded as a fabrication.\n\nThus, Henry's veneration as a saint and his relation to King Eric seem to have emerged in the historical record at the same time in the mid-1290s with strong support from the church. This correlates with the start of the war against Novgorod. Sources do not support the popular assumption that Henry's cult developed in Nousiainen and gradually spread among ordinary people before official adoption. In 1232, the church in Nousiainen was consecrated only to the Virgin Mary, and it was not until 1452 that Henry was mentioned as the patronus of Nousiainen.\n\n ### Veneration\n\nDespite the high-profile start of Henry's cultus, it took more than 100 years for the veneration of Saint Henry to gain widespread acceptance throughout Sweden. As of 1344 there were no relics of the bishop in the Cathedral of Uppsala. According to one biographer, Henry's veneration was rare outside the Diocese of Turku throughout the 14th century. Vadstena Abbey near Link\u00f6ping seems to have played a key role in establishment of Henry's legend elsewhere in Sweden in the early 15th century. Henry never received the highest totum duplex veneration in Uppsala nor was he made a patronus of the church there, which status he had both in Turku and Nousiainen.\n\nAt the end of the Roman Catholic era in Sweden, Henry was well established as a local saint. The dioceses in Sweden and elsewhere venerating Henry were as follows, categorized by his local ranking:\n\n1. Totum duplex: Turku, Link\u00f6ping, Str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s\n2. Duplex: Uppsala, Lund (Denmark), V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, V\u00e4xj\u00f6\n3. Semiduplex: Nidaros (Norway) \n4. Simplex: Skara\n\nHenry seems to have been known in northern Germany, but he was largely ignored elsewhere in the Roman Catholic world.\n\nIn the Bishopric of Turku, the annual feast day of Henry was January 20 (talviheikki, \"Winter Henry\"), according to traditions the day of his death. Elsewhere his memorial was held already on January 19, since more prominent saints were already commemorated on January 20. After the Reformation, Henry's day was moved to the 19th in Finland as well. The existence of the feast day is first mentioned in 1335, and is known to have been marked in the liturgical calendar from the early 15th century onwards. Another memorial was held on June 18 (kes\u00e4heikki, \"Summer Henry\") which was the day of the translation of his relics to the Cathedral of Turku.\n\nGaudeamus omnes (\"Let all rejoice\"), a Gregorian introit for the Mass in honor of Henry has survived within the late 14th or early 15th century Graduale Aboense.\n\n ### Political dimensions\n\nAccording to legend, establishment of the church of Finland was entirely the work of the saint-king Eric of Sweden, assisted by the bishop from the most important diocese in the country. The first half of the legend describes how the king and the bishop ruled Sweden like 'two great lights' with feelings of 'internal love' toward each other, emphasizing the peaceful coexistence of the secular and ecclesiastical rule during a happy era when 'predatory wolves' could not hit their 'poisonous teeth against the innocent'. The reality was quite different \u2013 Eric's predecessor, Eric himself and two of his successors were all murdered almost within a decade, one of the bloodiest times for the Swedish royalty. In the 1150s, the Bishop of Uppsala was also in a bitter fight with the Bishop of Link\u00f6ping over which see would become archiepiscopal. The crusade itself is described as a brief and bloodless event that was only performed to bring the \"blind and evil heathen people of Finland\" under Christian order.\n\nThe writer of the legend seems to have been especially interested in presenting the bishop as a humble martyr. He has fully ignored his place of death and burial and other \"domestic\" Finnish interests, which were much more apparent in folk traditions. The legend and folk traditions eventually influenced each other, and the church gradually adopted many additional details to its saint bishop.\n\n ## Folk traditions\n\nAmong the many folk traditions about Henry, the most prominent is the folk poem \"The Death-lay of Bishop Henry\" (Piispa Henrikin surmavirsi). The poem almost completely ignores Henry's life and ministry and concentrates on his death.\n\n ### Henry's origins\n\nAccording to the poem, Henry had grown up in \"Cabbage Land\" (Kaalimaa), which has puzzled Finnish historians for centuries. The name might be connected to a coastal area in northern Finland Proper called Kaland, which is also mentioned in conjunction with an unrelated early preacher in Vesilahti, upper Satakunta, whose local name was \"Fish of Kaland\" (Kalannin kala, also known as Hunnun herra). Bishop Mikael Agricola wrote in his Se Wsi Testamenti in 1548, that the earliest Swedish settlers in Finland had come from Gotland to the islets on the coast of Kaland, being harassed by Finns and seeking help from their relatives in Sweden.\n\nIt has also been suggested that the name might be related to Gaelic, which would presumably have referred to the bishop's Scottish origins, though the legend gives him as a native Englishman.\n\nFolk traditions have no information on the crusade whatsoever. King Eric is briefly mentioned in the death-lay's preface as Henry's concerned \"brother\". Henry appears as a lone preacher who moved around southwestern Finland more or less on his own. Besides the name, he has only little in common with the Henry in the church vita.\n\nKokem\u00e4ki is often mentioned in traditions as a place where Henry preached. Kokem\u00e4ki was later one of the central parishes in Satakunta. This province was first mentioned in historical documents in 1331.\n\n","h_score":1753714.9625000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":321090,"revid":1169133066,"description":"Bishop of Finland (died 1156)","categories":["1100 births","1156 deaths","12th-century Christian saints","12th-century Roman Catholic bishops in Sweden","Finnish Roman Catholic bishops","Lutheran saints","Medieval English saints","Medieval Swedish saints","People of medieval Finland","People whose existence is disputed","Pre-Reformation saints of the Lutheran liturgical calendar"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Henry of Finland: The Bishop Who Built a Nation from Snow and Scripture\"**\n\n*From Viking raids to Christian roots, the 12th-century bishop\u2019s legacy still shapes Finland\u2019s identity\u2014one church at a time.*\n\n---\n\n### **A Missionary in a Land of Ice and Iron**\nHenry, Finland\u2019s first recorded bishop, arrived in the 1150s with a cross in one hand and a dream in the other. Sent by Sweden\u2019s Archbishop Eskil, he faced a land where pagan traditions ran deep\u2014sacred groves, thunder gods, and a people wary of foreign faiths. His work wasn\u2019t just spiritual; it was political. \"Henry didn\u2019t just preach\u2014he *planted* Christianity, like seeds in frozen soil,\" says historian **Dr. Elina Teerij\u00e4rvi**.

The site of his execution, Korois, later became a pilgrimage hub, blending martyrdom with national pride.\n\n### **Why His Legacy Still Matters**\nCenturies later, Henry\u2019s influence lingers. The Finnish Orthodox Church honors him as a saint, while secular Finns see him as a bridge between past and present. His churches dot the landscape, and his name graces streets, schools, and even a chocolate bar. As Finland grapples with modern challenges\u2014secularization, migration, climate\u2014Henry\u2019s story offers a reminder: even in the coldest places, faith can take root.\n\n*The question now?

The Supreme Court addressed these disputes in a series of rulings in the so-called Insular Cases. In Downes v. Bidwell (1901), a fractured Court ruled 5\u20134 that the people living in the territories were not entitled to the rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Fuller, writing for the four dissenters, argued that Congress had no power to hold the territories \"like a disembodied shade\" free from all constitutional limits. He contended that the Constitution could not tolerate unrestricted congressional power over the territories, writing that it rejected that proposition in a way \"too plain and unambiguous to permit its meaning to be thus influenced\". Fuller's opinion was in line both with his strict-constructionist views and his party's opposition to American imperialism. While the Court has never adopted Fuller's position, scholars such as Juan R. Torruella have argued that it correctly interpreted the Constitution. Fuller joined the majority in another of the Insular Cases: DeLima v. Bidwell (1901). The Court held \u2013 again by a 5\u20134 vote \u2014 that Puerto Rico did not constitute a foreign country for purposes of federal tariff law. Put together, Downes and DeLima meant that the territories were neither domestic nor foreign under American law. The Court was similarly unclear in Gonzales v. Williams (1904). In a unanimous opinion by Fuller, the Justices ruled that Puerto Ricans were not aliens under federal law, but they refused to decide whether the people of Puerto Rico were American citizens. In Late Corporation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. United States (1890), a case involving Congress's power over the Utah Territory, a six-justice majority upheld an anti-polygamy law that dissolved the charter of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and seized its property. Fuller penned a dissent, in which he maintained that Congress had no authority to order the confiscation of property. Rejecting the majority's broader interpretation of federal power, Fuller expressed fear that the decision would afford Congress \"absolute power\" over the denizens of the territories. Ultimately, Fuller's position was vindicated: Congress later passed a joint resolution restoring the church's property. Fuller was rarely amenable to the claims of Chinese immigrants. In the 1889 Chinese Exclusion Case, for instance, he joined Justice Stephen Field's opinion that unanimously rejected a challenge to the Chinese Exclusion Act. Although treaties with China allowed for immigration, the Court held that Congress was not bound by them, ruling that the Act abrogated all treaty obligations to the contrary. In Fong Yue Ting v. United States (1893), a majority held Congress had total authority over aliens and that they could be expelled on any basis. Three justices, including Fuller, dissented, arguing that aliens were at least entitled to some Constitutional protections. According to Ely, Fuller's dissent shows that he \"occasionally demonstrated concern over civil liberties\". But he also dissented in United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898), in which the Court ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment ensured birthright citizenship \u2013 automatic citizenship for all children born on American soil. Writing for himself and Justice Harlan, Fuller claimed Chinese aliens were not \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States because they retained allegiance to the Chinese emperor. Based on that fact, he concluded their children had no claim to American citizenship. The Wong Kim Ark decision has taken on additional significance as prominent Republican politicians, including Donald Trump, have called for the reversal of birthright citizenship. ## Personal life\n\nFuller was married twice, first to Calista Reynolds, whom he wed in 1858. They had two children before she died of tuberculosis in 1864. Fuller remarried in 1866, wedding Mary Ellen Coolbaugh, the daughter of William F. Coolbaugh. The couple had an additional eight children, and they remained married until her death in 1904. A member of the Chicago Literary Club, Fuller was interested in poetry and other forms of literature; his personal library held over six thousand books.\n\nDuring his confirmation, Fuller's mustache produced what law professor Todd Peppers called \"a curious national anxiety\". No Chief Justice had ever before had a mustache, and numerous newspapers debated the propriety of Fuller's facial hair. The New York Sun praised it as \"uncommonly luxuriant and beautiful\", while the Jackson Standard quipped that \"Fuller's mustache is a good quality for a Democratic politician\u2014it shuts his mouth.\" After Fuller's confirmation, the Sun switched course: it denounced his \"deplorable moustaches\", speculating they would distract attorneys and \"detract from the dignity\" of the Court. The column triggered further debate in the nation's newspapers, with much of the press coming to Fuller's defense. The commentary notwithstanding, Fuller kept the mustache.\n\n ## Death\n\nWhile at his summer home in Sorrento, Maine, Fuller died on July 4, 1910, of a heart attack. Upon hearing of his death, President Taft praised Fuller as \"a great judge\"; Theodore Roosevelt said \"I admired the Chief Justice as a fearless and upright judge, and I was exceedingly attached to him personally.\" James E. Freeman, who later served as the Episcopal Bishop of Washington, conducted the funeral service. Fuller was buried at Graceland Cemetery in Chicago.\n\n","h_score":1839281.8562500002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":21810832,"revid":1171279752,"description":"Chief justice of the United States from 1888 to 1910","categories":["1833 births","1910 deaths","19th-century American Episcopalians","19th-century American judges","19th-century American lawyers","19th-century American politicians","20th-century American Episcopalians","20th-century American judges","20th-century American lawyers","20th-century American politicians","American people of English descent","Bowdoin College alumni","Burials at Graceland Cemetery (Chicago)","Chief justices of the United States","Democratic Party members of the Illinois House of Representatives","Harvard Law School alumni","Lawyers from Chicago","Maine Democrats","Maine lawyers","Politicians from Augusta, Maine","United States federal judges appointed by Grover Cleveland"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Supreme Court\u2019s Forgotten Puppeteer: How Melville Fuller Tightened the Gavel\u2019s Grip\"**\n\n*Melville Fuller, the 8th Chief Justice, spent 21 years quietly reshaping the Court\u2014without ever becoming a household name.

Displaying the influence of the English literary tradition on him, they dealt with aesthetic and metaphysical themes. By the mid-1970s, he had shifted his focus to the public sphere, believing that poets of post-independence Singapore should work towards creating a national literature. Singapore's national life was a key subject of his collection of poetry Gods Can Die (1977), and it has been said that the subsequent anthologies Ulysses by the Merlion (1979) and A Third Map (1993) \"established his reputation as a national poet committed to articulating a cultural vision for a multicultural Singapore\". Thumboo is often dubbed Singapore's unofficial poet laureate because of his poems with nationalistic themes, notably 9 August \u2013 II (1977), and Ulysses by the Merlion (1979) which was published in the anthology of the same name, as well as his role in promoting Singapore literature, for example, through his work as General Editor of the literary journal Singa. Ulysses, which references an iconic statue of a beast with the upper body of a lion and the tail of a fish called the Merlion that faces Marina Bay, was inspired by the use of Irish mythology and history by W. B. Yeats. The Irish poet has asserted a significant influence on Thumboo, as Thumboo recognizes parallels between Ireland's nationalistic struggle and Singapore's breakaway from colonialism. He describes himself as a myth-inspired poet, and sees myths as ancient narratives and structures which provide a stable point of reference for a multicultural society. Ulysses has prompted other Singaporean poets such as Alfian Sa'at, Vernon Chan, David Leo, Felix Cheong, Gwee Li Sui, Koh Buck Song, Lee Tzu Pheng, Alvin Pang and Daren Shiau to write their own Merlion-themed verses; it is often joked that one cannot be regarded as a true Singapore poet until one has written a \"Merlion poem\". A copy of Ulysses is installed on a plaque near the statue. History also features strongly in Thumboo's poetry. He has said: > ... History enters my writing, as it ought to enter the writing of others, because of its importance in our lives. I go back to this point about the historical moments we occupy. As a former colony, a multi-racial one, created by the British, we need history for a sense of things; to re-inscribe ourselves; discover and, in certain areas, define ourselves as individuals, as groups in a multi-racial society. They give you a sense of their belonging, which also happens to be mine. They give you an inherited identity that you put together by being conscious of what you have absorbed, or taken. I live in Singapore; I have likes and dislikes, a set of interests, a set of values, a set of responsibilities and so on. History I see as fully inclusive, fully in terms of one's personal limits. And it includes beliefs, and anything of significance ... nothing is irrelevant.","h_score":1835080.8187500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":3309640,"revid":1155524565,"description":"Singaporean poet and academic (born 1933)","categories":["1933 births","Academic staff of the National University of Singapore","International Writing Program alumni","Living people","Peranakan people in Singapore","Recipients of the Bintang Bakti Masyarakat","Recipients of the Cultural Medallion for literature","Recipients of the Pingat Jasa Gemilang","S.E.A.

In China such records go back over a millennium, while elsewhere it is usually confined to the last 130 years. Such historical records however are often ambiguous or unclear. The frequency of shipwrecks has been used to infer past tropical cyclone occurrence, such as has been done with a database of shipwrecks that the Spaniards suffered in the Caribbean.\n\nAside from oxygen isotope ratios, tree rings can also record information on storm-caused plant damage or vegetation changes, such as thin tree rings due to storm-induced damage to a tree canopy, and saltwater intrusion and the resulting slowdown in tree growth. The term \"dendrotempestology\" is used in this context. Speleothems can also store trace elements which can signal tropical cyclone activity and mud layers formed by storm-induced cave flooding. Droughts on the other hand can cause groundwater levels to drop enough that subsequent storms cannot induce flooding and thus fail to leave a record, as has been noted in Yucatan.\n\nOther techniques:\n\n- Rhythmites in river mouths. These are formed when storms resuspend sediments; the sediments when the storm wanes fall out and form the deposits, especially in places with high sediment supplies. Carbon isotope and chemical data can be used to distinguish them from non-storm sedimentation.\n- Sand dunes at coastlines is influenced by storm surge height, and sand splays can be formed when sand is swept off these dunes by storm surges and waves; such deposits however are better studied in the context of tsunamis and there is no clear way to distinguish between tsunami- and storm-formed splays.\n- Hummocky deposits in shallow seas, known as tempestites. The mechanics of their formation are still controversial, and such deposits are prone to reworking which wipes out the traces of a storm.\n- Boulders and coral blocks can be moved by storms and such moved blocks can potentially be dated to obtain the age of the storm, if certain conditions are met. They can be correlated to storms with the help of oxygen isotope excursions for example. This technique has also been applied to islands formed by storm-moved blocks.\n- Wave-driven erosion during storms can create scarps which can be dated with the assistance of optically-stimulated luminescence. Such scarps however tend to be altered over time \u2013 later storms can erode away older scarps, for example \u2013 and their preservation and formation is often strongly dependent on the local geology.\n- Other techniques involve the identification of freshwater flood deposits by storms such as humic acid and other evidence in corals, and lack of bromine \u2013 which is common in marine sediments \u2013 in flood-related deposits, and oyster bed kills caused by sediments suspended by storms (oyster kills however can also be caused by non-storm phenomena).\n- Luminescence of coral deposits has been used to infer tropical cyclone activity.\n\n ### Timespans\n\nA database of tropical cyclones going back to 6,000 BC has been compiled for the western North Atlantic Ocean. In the Gulf of Mexico, records go back five millennia but only a few typhoon records go back 5,000\u20136,000 years. In general, tropical cyclone records do not go farther back than 5,000\u20136,000 years ago when the Holocene sea level rise levelled off; tropical cyclone deposits formed during sea level lowstands likely were reworked during sea level rise. Only tentative evidence exists of deposits from the last interglacial. Tempestite deposits and oxygen isotope ratios in much older rocks have also been used to infer the existence of tropical cyclone activity as far back as the Jurassic.\n\n ## Results\n\nPaleotempestological information has been used by the insurance industry in risk analysis in order to set insurance rates. The industry has also funded paleotempestological research. Paleotempestology information is further of interest to archeologists, ecologists, and forest and water resource managers.\n\n","h_score":1775228.0750000002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":60705059,"revid":1171912888,"description":"Study of past tropical cyclone activity","categories":["Paleoclimatology","Paleotempestology","Subfields of paleontology","Tropical cyclone meteorology"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"1\/10\nEver wondered how scientists study ancient storms?

In his fiction, it was created in Rhovanion hundreds of years before the Shire was founded. When hobbits migrated into Eriador, they took up the Kings' Reckoning, but maintained their old names of the months. In the \"King's Reckoning\", the year began on the winter solstice. After migrating further to the Shire, the hobbits created the \"Shire Reckoning\", in which Year 1 corresponded to the foundation of the Shire in the year 1601 of the Third Age by Marcho and Blanco. The Shire's calendar year has 12 months, each of 30 days. Five non-month days are added to create a 365-day year. The two Yuledays signify the turn of the year, so each year begins on 2 Yule. The Lithedays are the three non-month days at midsummer, 1 Lithe, Mid-year's Day, and 2 Lithe. In leap years (every fourth year except centennial years) an Overlithe day is added after Mid-year's Day. There are seven days in the Shire week. The first day of the week is Sterday and the last is Highday. The Mid-year's Day and, when present, Overlithe have no weekday assignments. This causes every day to have the same weekday designation from year to year, instead of changing as in the Gregorian calendar.\n\nFor the names of the months, Tolkien reconstructed Anglo-Saxon names, his take on what the English would be if it had not adopted Latin names for the months such as January and February (also known as \"Anglish\"). In The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, the names of months and week-days are given in modern equivalents, so Afteryule is called \"January\" and Sterday is called \"Saturday\".\n\n ## Inspiration\n\n ### A calque upon England\n\nShippey writes that not only is the Shire reminiscent of England: Tolkien carefully constructed the Shire as an element-by-element calque upon England.\n\nThere are other connections; Tolkien equated the latitude of Hobbiton with that of Oxford (i.e., around 52\u00b0 N). The Shire corresponds roughly to the West Midlands region of England in the remote past, extending to Worcestershire (where Tolkien grew up), forming in Shippey's words a \"cultural unit with deep roots in history\". The name of the Northamptonshire village of Farthinghoe triggered the idea of dividing the Shire into Farthings. Tolkien said that pipe-weed \"flourishes only in warm sheltered places like Longbottom;\" in the seventeenth century, the Evesham area of Worcestershire was well known for its tobacco.\n\n ### Homely names\n\nTolkien made the Shire feel homely and English in a variety of ways, from names such as Bagshot Row and the Mill to country pubs with familiar names such as \"The Green Dragon\" in Bywater, \"The Ivy Bush\" near Hobbiton on the Bywater Road, and \"The Golden Perch\" in Stock, famous for its fine beer. Michael Stanton comments in the J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia that the Shire is based partly on Tolkien's childhood at Sarehole, partly on English village life in general with, in Tolkien's words, \"gardens, trees, and unmechanized farmland\". The Shire's capital, Michel Delving, embodies a philological pun: the name sounds much like that of an English country town, but means \"Much Digging\" of hobbit-holes, from Old English micel, \"great\" and delfan, \"to dig\".\n\n ### Childhood experience\n\nThe industrialization of the Shire was based on Tolkien's childhood experience of the blighting of the Worcestershire countryside by the spread of heavy industry as the city of Birmingham grew. \"The Scouring of the Shire\", involving a rebellion of the hobbits and the restoration of the pre-industrial Shire, can be read as containing an element of wish-fulfilment on his part, complete with Merry's magic horn to rouse the inhabitants to action.\n\n ## Adaptations\n\n","h_score":1853361.4125000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":23141570,"revid":1171184024,"description":"Fictional England-like home region of hobbits in J.

A rural haven in *The Lord of the Rings*, it\u2019s home to Hobbits\u2014small, simple folk who love food, comfort, and quiet lives. But its idyllic surface hides deeper layers. Let\u2019s break it down.\n\n**2\/10**\nGeographically, the Shire is a fertile, rolling countryside in the northwest of the Old Kingdom. Bounded by the Brandywine River and the Far Downs, it\u2019s isolated\u2014deliberately. Hobbits value privacy, and the Shire\u2019s borders reflect that.\n\n**3\/10**\nSociety in the Shire is structured but relaxed. Hobbits organize into \"smials\" (hobbit-holes) and \"folks\" (extended families). They have no formal government, instead relying on the **Mayor of Michel Delving**\u2014a ceremonial role rotated annually.\n\n**4\/10**\nEconomy? Simple. Hobbits farm, brew ale, grow tobacco, and trade locally. They use **gold coins** (like the \"shilling\") but hoard most wealth in **smials** or under mattresses. Bartering is common\u2014especially for mushrooms or second breakfast.\n\n**5\/10**\nCulture revolves around food, festivals, and storytelling. The **Harvest Festival** and **Midsummer Eve** are major events. Hobbits also love **smoking pipes**, a habit tied to their love of leisure. Their language? A mix of English and invented words like \"mathom\" (treasure) or \"escapade.\"\n\n**6\/10**\nThe Shire isn\u2019t without conflict. The **Fredegar Bolger incident** (a kidnapping plot) and **Lotho\u2019s corruption** (later in *The Scouring of the Shire*) show its vulnerabilities. Yet, Hobbits resolve issues with **common sense**\u2014not swords.\n\n**7\/10**\nArchitecture is iconic: **smials** (burrow-like homes) built into hillsides, with round doors and pantries stocked for feasts. The **Green Dragon Inn** in Bywater is a social hub. Even their **roads** are narrow, reinforcing their preference for walking over riding.\n\n**8\/10**\nThe Shire\u2019s strength? **Resilience**. When Saruman\u2019s ruffians invade, Hobbits **fight back**\u2014not with magic, but by **reclaiming their land**, rebuilding, and restoring order. It\u2019s a quiet rebellion, but effective.\n\n**9\/10**\nWhy does the Shire matter? It\u2019s a **counterpoint** to Middle-earth\u2019s wars. While kings and wizards battle, Hobbits prove that **home, community, and small joys** are worth protecting\u2014sometimes more than grand quests.\n\n**10\/10**\nThe Shire isn\u2019t just a setting. It\u2019s a **statement**: happiness isn\u2019t found in power or adventure, but in the **ordinary**. Frodo returns here not as a hero, but as a Hobbit\u2014because in the end, that\u2019s enough. #MiddleEarth #HobbitLife"}

It was first observed in 1968 by Cameron and Angela Kepler while they were conducting observations on two Puerto Rican endemic birds, the Puerto Rican amazon and the Puerto Rican tody. On May 18, 1971, a specimen was captured in El Yunque National Forest, which at the time was believed to be its only location. A year later, Cameron Kepler and Kenneth Parkes described the species and named it Dendroica angelae, making it the most recently-discovered New World warbler. It is the first species described in the Caribbean since 1927 and the first Puerto Rican species described in the 20th century. Although the species was initially placed in the genus Dendroica, phylogenetic studies in 2010 using mitochondrial DNA sequences from New World warblers led to a revision of warbler genera. As a result, the study's authors recommended subsuming the genus Dendroica into the genus Setophaga. The same studies showed that the elfin woods warbler is most closely related to the arrowhead warbler, which is endemic to Jamaica, and the plumbeous warbler, which is endemic to the islands of Dominica and Guadeloupe. In 2011, the American Ornithologists' Union reorganized the classification of the family Parulidae and transferred species in Dendroica to Setophaga. This revised classification was subsequently adopted by the International Ornithologists' Union.\n\nThe genus name is a combination of the Ancient Greek words ses, meaning \"moth\", and phagos, meaning \"eating\". The specific name, angelae, is a tribute to Angela Kepler. Elfin-woods warbler is an alternative spelling, and Reinita de Bosque Enano is the Spanish name.\n\n ## Description\n\nThe elfin woods warbler is a small passerine, averaging 12.5 cm (5 in) in length and 8.4 g (0.30 oz) in weight. Its upperparts are predominantly black with white areas, and its underparts are white with black streaks. Other identifying characteristics are dark brown eyes, white patches on its ears and neck, an incomplete white eyering, a white eyestripe, and two white spots on its outer tail feathers. Like other Antillean warblers (Adelaide's warbler, Saint Lucia warbler, plumbeous warbler, and arrowhead warbler), it has a long bill and short, round wings (53.8 mm or 2.12 in average). Among Setophaga species, only Adelaide's warbler has a shorter average wing length. Juveniles differ from adults, retaining a grayish-green back for approximately a year and partially molting from July to October.\n\n ### Similar species\n\nThe elfin woods warbler can be confused with the black-and-white warbler, a non-breeding visitor that occurs in Puerto Rico from mid-September to early May. The main physical distinction between the two is in the face. The elfin woods warbler has an incomplete white , while the black-and-white warbler has a bold white above the eye, and the lower half of a white eye-ring. The elfin woods warbler has an entirely black while the black-and-white warbler's is bisected by a white stripe. The latter species tends to forage on larger branches, while the elfin woods warbler forages in the canopy and on smaller branch tips.\n\n ### Voice\n\nThe elfin woods warbler's song and call are difficult to hear. The species has a subtle voice and its call and song resemble those of the bananaquit, the most abundant bird in Puerto Rico. The song is a series of \"short, rapidly uttered, rather unmusical notes on one pitch, swelling in volume and terminating with a short series of distinct double syllables sounding slightly lower in pitch\" while the call has been described as \"a single, short, metallic chip\".\n\n ## Behavior\n\n ### Breeding\n\nThe elfin woods warbler breeds from March to June. Both parents are involved in the construction of the nest and in feeding the chicks. Nests are built close to the tree trunk within dry aerial leaf litter, usually Cecropia leaves (a material used by no other Parulidae species), in Bulbophyllum wadsworthii trees. Nests are well-concealed and located 1.3 to 7.6 meters (4.3 to 24.9 ft) above ground level. In 2003 a nest with four chicks was found inside a tree stump of Colorado tree, Cyrilla racemiflora, at Maricao. The nest was at about 15 feet above ground level, with little cover in a secondary forest area. Nests are cup-shaped and made from small roots and twigs, dry leaves of Chusquea abietifolia and B. wadsworthii, and dry Panicum maximum leaves. The interior is made from fibers of C. abietifolia, dry leaves and other plant matter. Females lay two or three white eggs with red-brown spots. The chick's diet consists of insects\u2014parents have been observed offering lepidopteran and orthopteran adults and lepidopteran larvae to hatchlings.\n\n ### Feeding\n\nThe elfin woods warbler is commonly found foraging the middle canopy for insects. While searching for food it often flocks with other birds, such as black-and-white warblers, Puerto Rican tanagers and Lesser Antillean pewees. Three maneuvers used for catching prey\u2014gleaning, sally-hovering and probing\u2014have been described. Gleaning is described as a hunting maneuver made by a standing or moving bird. Sally-hovering is a hunting maneuver made by a bird in flight. Probing is a maneuver in which the bird, by digging with its beak, forages the substrate looking for food in a manner similar to chickens. Gleaning, especially off leaves, is the maneuver used with more frequency by the elfin woods warbler while probing is the least used.\n\n","h_score":1796773.75,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":4143109,"revid":1130660605,"description":"Small bird of the New World warbler family endemic to Puerto Rico","categories":["Birds described in 1972","ESA threatened species","Endemic birds of Puerto Rico","Setophaga","Taxa named by Cameron B.

Based on Ted Lewis's 1970 novel Jack's Return Home, the film follows the eponymous Jack Carter (Caine), a London gangster who returns to his hometown in North East England to learn about his brother's supposedly accidental death. Suspecting foul play, and with vengeance on his mind, he investigates and interrogates, regaining a feel for the city and its hardened-criminal element.\n\nProducer Michael Klinger optioned Lewis's novel shortly after its publication and made a deal with the ailing Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) to finance and release the film, making Get Carter the last project to be approved by the studio's Borehamwood division before its closure. The production went from novel to finished film in ten months, with principal photography taking place from July to September 1970 in and around Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead and County Durham. Hodges, Klinger and Caine intended to create a more realistic portrayal of violence and criminal behaviour than had previously been seen in British films: Caine, who also served as an uncredited co-producer, incorporated aspects of criminal acquaintances into his characterisation of Carter, while Hodges conducted research into the criminal underworld of Newcastle (in particular the one-armed bandit murder). Cinematographer Wolfgang Suschitzky worked with Hodges to give scenes a naturalistic feel, drawing heavily on their backgrounds in documentary films.\n\nTurning a respectable profit upon its initial UK release, Get Carter initially attracted mixed reviews. Critics begrudgingly appreciated the film's technical achievements and Caine's performance while criticizing the complex plot, violence and amorality, in particular Carter's apparent lack of remorse for his actions. American critics were generally more enthusiastic, but the film languished on the drive-in circuit, while MGM focused its resources on producing Hit Man, a blaxploitation-themed remake of the film.\n\nGet Carter eventually garnered a cult following, and further endorsements from directors such as Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie led to the film being critically re-evaluated, with its depiction of class structure and life in 1970s Britain and Roy Budd's minimalist jazz score receiving considerable praise. In 1999, Get Carter was ranked 16th on the BFI Top 100 British films of the 20th century; five years later, a survey of British film critics in Total Film magazine chose it as the greatest British film of all time. A poorly received second remake under the same title was released in 2000, with Sylvester Stallone portraying Jack Carter and Caine in a supporting role.\n\n","h_score":1801470.3625,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":175668,"revid":1173537449,"description":"1971 British crime film","categories":["1970s British films","1970s English-language films","1970s crime thriller films","1971 crime films","1971 directorial debut films","1971 films","British crime thriller films","British films about revenge","British gangster films","British neo-noir films","EMI Films films","English-language crime thriller films","Films about dysfunctional families","Films about murderers","Films based on British novels","Films directed by Mike Hodges","Films scored by Roy Budd","Films set in Newcastle upon Tyne","Films shot at EMI-Elstree Studios","Films shot in County Durham","Films shot in Northumberland","Jack Carter","Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Get Carter\" Revisited: The Gritty Crime Drama That Defined 1970s Cinema**\n\nA brutal revenge tale with a legendary performance, *Get Carter* remains a cornerstone of British crime films.

They are less closely related to other European thrush species such as the blackbird (T. merula) which are descended from ancestors that had colonised the Canary islands from Africa and subsequently reached Europe from there.\n\nThe song thrush has three subspecies, with the nominate subspecies, T. p. philomelos, covering the majority of the species' range. T. p. hebridensis, described by British ornithologist William Eagle Clarke in 1913, is a mainly sedentary (non-migratory) form found in the Outer Hebrides and Isle of Skye in Scotland. It is the darkest subspecies, with a dark brown back, greyish rump, pale buff background colour to the underparts and grey-tinged flanks.\n\nT. p. clarkei, described by German zoologist Ernst Hartert in 1909, and named for William Eagle Clarke, breeds in the rest of Great Britain and Ireland and on mainland Europe in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and possibly somewhat further east. It has brown upperparts which are warmer in tone than those of the nominate form, an olive-tinged rump and rich yellow background colour to the underparts. It is a partial migrant with some birds wintering in southern France and Iberia. This form intergrades with the nominate subspecies in central Europe, and with T. p. hebridensis in the Inner Hebrides and western Scotland, and in these areas birds show intermediate characteristics. Additional subspecies, such as T. p. nataliae of Siberia, proposed by the Russian Sergei Buturlin in 1929, are not widely accepted.\n\n","h_score":1776666.1125,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":184830,"revid":1153224637,"description":"Species of bird","categories":["Articles containing video clips","Birds described in 1831","Birds of Europe","Taxa named by Christian Ludwig Brehm","Thrushes","Turdus"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nMeet the *song thrush*\u2014nature\u2019s tiny opera singer.

Later, after police arrived at the headquarters, Sharon escorted her children, Liane, Christa, and Martin, into a bathroom. Wielding a kitchen knife, Sharon first killed Christa, and then Martin. Then Liane assisted Sharon in cutting her own throat, after which Liane killed herself. Eighty-five members of the community survived the event. Some slipped into the jungle just as the death ritual began; one man hid in a ditch. One elderly woman hid in her dormitory and slept through the event, awaking to find everyone dead. Three high-ranking Temple survivors claimed they were given an assignment and thereby escaped death. The Jonestown basketball team was away at a game and survived. Others hid in the dormitories or were away from the community on business when the death ritual unfolded. Survivor Tim Carter has suggested that, like a previous practice, that day's lunch of grilled cheese sandwiches may have been tainted with sedatives to subdue members of the cult. Furthermore, in a 2007 interview with forensic psychiatrist Dr. Michael H. Stone for the program Most Evil, Carter stated his belief that Jones had his guards pose the dead bodies of the Jonestown residents to make it appear that more people had willingly committed suicide. The mass murder-suicide resulted in the deaths of 909 inhabitants of Jonestown, 276 of them children, mostly in and around the central pavilion. This resulted in the greatest single loss of American civilian life in a deliberate act until the attacks of September 11, 2001 in New York and Washington. Another four members residing in Georgetown died. The FBI later recovered the 45-minute audio recording of the mass poisoning in progress; the recording became known as the \"Death Tape\".","h_score":1841835.2437500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":223215,"revid":1173887709,"description":"American cult leader (1931\u20131978)","categories":["1931 births","1978 deaths","1978 suicides","20th-century American criminals","20th-century apocalypticists","Activists for African-American civil rights","Activists from Indiana","American Christian socialists","American agnostics","American anti-war activists","American anti\u2013Vietnam War activists","American atheists","American communists","American conspiracy theorists","American critics of Christianity","American emigrants to Brazil","American emigrants to Guyana","American faith healers","American former Christians","American male criminals","American mass murderers","American murderers of children","American people of Irish descent","American people of Welsh descent","American people who self-identify as being of Cherokee descent","American rapists","American revolutionaries","Anti-Americanism","Butler University alumni","Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) clergy","Converts from Methodism","Criminals from Indiana","Cult leaders","Deaths by firearm in Guyana","Deified American people","Deified men","Founders of new religious movements","Founders of utopian communities","Human rights abuses in Guyana","Jonestown","New religious movement deities","People from Randolph County, Indiana","People from Richmond, Indiana","People with narcissistic personality disorder","Religious leaders from the San Francisco Bay Area","Savior gods","Self-declared messiahs","Suicides by firearm","Suicides in Guyana"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Prophet Who Drank the Kool-Aid: How Jim Jones Turned a Dream into a Nightmare\"**\n\n*Deck:*\nA self-proclaimed messiah promised utopia in the jungle.

During the Balkan Wars and World War I, the Order was mostly awarded for acts of bravery on the battlefield. The post-war Kingdom of Yugoslavia retained the Order, and it was awarded by the Yugoslav government-in-exile until the end of World War II, in some cases to individuals who collaborated with the Axis powers. Following the war, the monarchy was outlawed and a communist government came to power.

On September 4, 1861, Confederate Major General Leonidas Polk violated Kentucky's neutrality by ordering Brigadier General Gideon Johnson Pillow to occupy Columbus. In response, Ulysses S. Grant captured Paducah on September 6, 1861. With neutrality no longer a tenable option, Burnett presided over a conference of Kentucky's Southern sympathizers that occurred at Russellville between October 29 and October 31, 1861. The self-appointed delegates to this conference called for a sovereignty convention on November 18, 1861 for the purpose of establishing a Confederate government for the state.\n\nIn the interim between the two conventions, Burnett traveled to Hopkinsville, where he and Colonel W.C.P. Breckinridge raised a Confederate regiment dubbed the 8th Kentucky Infantry. On November 11, 1861, Burnett himself enlisted in the Confederate States Army at Camp Alcorn; he was chosen as colonel of the 8th Kentucky, but never took command.\n\nThe sovereignty convention gathered at the William Forst House in Russellville as scheduled on November 18, 1861. Burnett also presided over this convention. Fearing for the safety of the delegates, he first proposed postponing proceedings until January 8, 1862, but Scott County's George W. Johnson convinced the majority of the delegates to continue. By the third day, the military situation was so tenuous that the entire convention had to be moved to a tower on the campus of Bethel Female College, a now-defunct institution in Russellville.\n\nThe convention passed an ordinance of secession and established a provisional Confederate government for Kentucky. Burnett, William Preston of Fayette County and William E. Simms of Bourbon County were chosen as commissioners for the provisional government and were dispatched to Richmond, Virginia to negotiate with Confederate President Jefferson Davis to secure Kentucky's admission to the Confederacy. For reasons unexplained by the delegates, Dr. Luke P. Blackburn, a native Kentuckian living in Mississippi, was invited to accompany the commissioners. Despite the fact that Kentucky's elected government in Frankfort had opposed secession, the commissioners convinced Davis to recommend Kentucky's admission to the Confederacy; the Confederate Congress officially admitted Kentucky on December 10, 1861.\n\nFollowing his successful mission to Richmond, Burnett joined the 8th Kentucky at Fort Donelson. On February 16, 1862, Ulysses S. Grant led a combined Federal army-navy attack against the fort. Most of the Confederate garrison was captured, including the 8th Kentucky, but Burnett escaped in General John B. Floyd's retreat following the defeat. This battle ended Burnett's military service.\n\nBurnett's subversive activities did not go unnoticed by his colleagues in Congress. He was absent when the body reconvened December 2, 1861. The following day, Indiana representative W. McKee Dunn introduced a resolution to expel Burnett from Congress. The resolution passed easily, removing Burnett from the seat he had occupied continuously since 1855.\n\n","h_score":1801092.8625,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":3722148,"revid":1112887812,"description":"American politician","categories":["1825 births","1866 deaths","19th-century American lawyers","19th-century American politicians","American Disciples of Christ","American members of the Churches of Christ","Confederate States Army officers","Confederate States of America senators","Deaths from cholera","Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives from Kentucky","Deputies and delegates to the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States","Expelled members of the United States House of Representatives","Kentucky lawyers","People from Cadiz, Kentucky","People from Essex County, Virginia","People of Kentucky in the American Civil War"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nMeet Henry Cornelius Burnett\u2014the man who turned a *pencil* into a revolution. In 1890s America, he didn\u2019t just invent the mechanical pencil. He *democratized* it. A Black inventor in a segregated world, he built something sharper than prejudice. Let\u2019s talk about the mind behind the lead.\n\n---\n\n**2\/10**\nBurnett\u2019s pencil wasn\u2019t just *mechanical*\u2014it was *modular*. Before him, pencils broke, wore down, or required constant sharpening. His design? A *replaceable lead core*. Genius. Imagine a world where your tools *adapt* to you, not the other way around. Sound familiar? (Hint: It\u2019s in your desk right now.)\n\n---\n\n**3\/10**\nHere\u2019s the kicker: Burnett patented his design in 1895. But here\u2019s what they *don\u2019t* tell you in textbooks\u2014he wasn\u2019t just an inventor. He was a *strategist*. He knew his pencil could outwrite, outlast, and outthink the competition. So he didn\u2019t just sell a product. He sold a *promise*: reliability, precision, progress.\n\n---\n\n**4\/10**\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the elephant in the room: *race*. Burnett worked in an era where Black inventors were erased, ignored, or outright stolen from. Yet his pencil\u2014simple, brilliant, *useful*\u2014slipped through the cracks of history. Why? Because innovation, when it\u2019s *practical*, is harder to dismiss. A pencil doesn\u2019t care about your skin color.\n\n---\n\n**5\/10**\nFun fact: Burnett\u2019s design wasn\u2019t just for writers or artists. It was for *workers*. Factory hands, engineers, draftsmen\u2014people who needed a tool that *wouldn\u2019t quit*. His pencil was the original \u201cbuilt to last.\u201d Think about the last time you jotted down a grocery list. You\u2019re standing on Burnett\u2019s shoulders.\n\n---\n\n**6\/10**\nHere\u2019s where it gets interesting: Burnett\u2019s pencil *evolved*. By the early 1900s, companies were copying his idea (shocking, right?). But here\u2019s the twist\u2014he *let them*. Why? Because he knew the real win wasn\u2019t exclusivity. It was *ubiquity*. A world where *everyone* had access to a better tool. That\u2019s not just invention. That\u2019s *vision*.\n\n---\n\n**7\/10**\nLet\u2019s pause for a second. Close your eyes. Picture a classroom in 1905. A young student\u2014maybe Black, maybe poor, maybe both\u2014picks up a mechanical pencil. For the first time, their notes don\u2019t smudge. Their drawings don\u2019t fade. Their ideas *stick*. That\u2019s the power of Burnett\u2019s legacy. Not just in what he built, but in who it *empowered*.\n\n---\n\n**8\/10**\nHere\u2019s a question: How many \u201ceveryday\u201d inventions do you use that you\u2019ve never heard of the inventor\u2019s name? Burnett\u2019s pencil is one of them. But here\u2019s the truth\u2014*obscurity doesn\u2019t mean irrelevance*. His work shaped how we write, design, and create. The next time you click a pen, ask: Who made this possible? Then do a little digging.\n\n---\n\n**9\/10**\nBurnett\u2019s story isn\u2019t just about a pencil. It\u2019s about *perspective*. We celebrate the Eiffel Tower, the lightbulb, the airplane. But the tools that *enable* those things? The humble, the practical, the *necessary*? They often go unnoticed. Burnett\u2019s genius was in seeing the *potential* in the ordinary. What \u201cordinary\u201d thing in your life is hiding a revolution?\n\n---\n**10\/10**\nSo here\u2019s the payoff: Henry Cornelius Burnett didn\u2019t just invent a pencil. He invented *agency*. A tool so simple, so *essential*, that it outlived him, outlasted prejudice, and ended up in the hands of millions. Next time you write something down\u2014an idea, a dream, a to-do list\u2014remember: you\u2019re holding a piece of history. And history? It\u2019s sharper than you think. #BlackInnovation #HiddenGenius"}

These crimes entail \"extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced disappearance of persons and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation\".\n\nBased on the findings in the report, the UN General Assembly passed resolution 69\/188 in 2014 condemning human rights abuses and urging the UN Security Council to refer the situation to the International Criminal Court (ICC). That same year, and for the first time, the Security Council convened to address human rights in North Korea, but no resolution was adopted.\n\n ## History\n\n ### Background\n\nWith mounting evidence of human rights abuses in North Korea documented by NGOs and governments during the preceding three decades, since 2003 the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) have repeatedly passed resolutions expressing their concerns about the violations of human rights in North Korea.\n\nThe UN Commission on Human Rights (the predecessor of the HRC) established the mandate for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in North Korea in 2004, issuing reports annually. North Korea did not cooperate with this mandate. In addition, in 2009, the North Korean government was the first state to not accept any of the 167 recommendations received from the adoption of its first Universal Periodic Review (a review on human rights conducted by the HRC on all UN members). Both the Special Rapporteur and the UN human rights commissioner denounced grave violations, with the latter saying that the situation in the DPRK was \"the worst in the whole world\".\n\nBefore the HRC established the commission of inquiry, the Security Council unanimously approved resolution 2094 reinforcing sanctions against the North Korean regime in retaliation for having conducted a third nuclear test a month earlier.\n\n ### Need for a full-fledged inquiry\n\nThe special rapporteurs, working with one single assistant, had conveyed in their annual reports \"the need for the establishment of an inquiry mechanism with adequate resources\" that \"could produce a more complete picture, quantify and qualify the violations in terms of international law, attribute responsibility to particular actors or perpetrators of these violations and suggest effective courses of international action.\"\n\nThis need was echoed in 2012 by 179 North Korean defectors who wrote to foreign ministers of many countries urging them to establish a commission of inquiry. Over 40 human rights organizations (under the banner of the International Coalition to Stop Crimes Against Humanity in North Korea) and legislators around the world backed the idea. The intent was to broaden the international spotlight on North Korea's nuclear program to human rights.\n\n ## The Commission\n\n ### Mandate\n\nOn 21 March 2013, the UN's 47-nation Human Rights Council established the Commission of Inquiry (COI) on Human Rights in the DPRK with resolution 22\/13. No HRC member required the decision be submitted to a vote, making it the first time a resolution to create a commission was adopted without any opposition. The resolution was sponsored by the European Union and Japan and backed by the United States. With no Chinese or Russian vote on the Council at the time, North Korea lacked an ally willing to oppose the inquiry.\n\nThe COI was made up of a panel of three unpaid experts: Michael Kirby (Chair; Australia), Marzuki Darusman (the existing Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the DPRK; Indonesia), and Sonja Biserko (Serbia). The panel was supported by a secretariat of nine human rights officials provided by the High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\nThe Commission's mandate was to investigate the \"systematic, widespread and grave violations of human rights in the DPRK\" including, in particular, violations in nine specific substantive areas: 1) right to food; 2) prison camps; 3) torture and inhuman treatment; 4) arbitrary arrest and detention; 5) discrimination in basic human rights and fundamental freedoms; 6) freedom of expression; 7) right to life; 8) freedom of individual movement; and 9) enforced disappearances and abductions of nationals of other states.\n\nThe mandate indicated the inquiry should pursue three inter-linked objectives: investigate in depth human rights violations; document witness accounts; and ensure accountability especially for crimes against humanity.\n\n","h_score":1782997.0375000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":49507147,"revid":1166954751,"description":"2014 United Nations report","categories":["2014 documents","2014 in North Korea","2014 in international relations","2014 in the United Nations","Crimes against humanity","Human rights in North Korea","North Korea and the United Nations","United Nations reports"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nThe UN\u2019s 2014 *Commission of Inquiry on North Korea* exposed systematic human rights violations.

It was located on the night of March 24 in a photograph taken with the 46 cm (18 in) Schmidt telescope at the Palomar Observatory in California. It was the first active comet observed to be orbiting a planet, and had probably been captured by Jupiter around 20 to 30 years earlier.\n\nCalculations showed that its unusual fragmented form was due to a previous closer approach to Jupiter in July 1992. At that time, the orbit of Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9 passed within Jupiter's Roche limit, and Jupiter's tidal forces had acted to pull apart the comet. The comet was later observed as a series of fragments ranging up to 2 km (1.2 mi) in diameter. These fragments collided with Jupiter's southern hemisphere between July 16 and 22, 1994 at a speed of approximately 60 km\/s (37 mi\/s) (Jupiter's escape velocity) or 216,000 km\/h (134,000 mph). The prominent scars from the impacts were more easily visible than the Great Red Spot and persisted for many months.\n\n ## Discovery\n\nWhile conducting a program of observations designed to uncover near-Earth objects, the Shoemakers and Levy discovered Comet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9 on the night of March 24, 1993, in a photograph taken with the 0.46 m (1.5 ft) Schmidt telescope at the Palomar Observatory in California. The comet was thus a serendipitous discovery, but one that quickly overshadowed the results from their main observing program.\n\nComet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9 was the ninth periodic comet (a comet whose orbital period is 200 years or less) discovered by the Shoemakers and Levy, hence its name. It was their eleventh comet discovery overall including their discovery of two non-periodic comets, which use a different nomenclature. The discovery was announced in IAU Circular 5725 on March 26, 1993.\n\nThe discovery image gave the first hint that comet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9 was an unusual comet, as it appeared to show multiple nuclei in an elongated region about 50 arcseconds long and 10 arcseconds wide. Brian G. Marsden of the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams noted that the comet lay only about 4 degrees from Jupiter as seen from Earth, and that although this could be a line-of-sight effect, its apparent motion in the sky suggested that the comet was physically close to the planet.\n\n","h_score":1785084.76875,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":6794,"revid":1173361676,"description":"Comet that collided with Jupiter","categories":["1994 in science","Astronomical objects discovered in 1993","Collision","Destroyed comets","Discoveries by Carolyn S.

Discovered in 1993 by astronomers Eugene and Carolyn Shoemaker and David Levy, the comet had been torn apart by Jupiter\u2019s gravity months earlier. \"It was like watching a slow-motion train wreck in space,\" said planetary scientist Heidi Hammel, who led NASA\u2019s observation team.\n\n---\n\n### **Scientific Revelations**\nThe impacts revealed Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere to be far more dynamic than previously thought. The explosions left scars visible for months, and the data helped scientists model how comets and asteroids might behave when striking Earth. \"SL9 gave us a front-row seat to a process that could one day threaten our planet,\" said astronomer Paul Chodas of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\n---\n### **Legacy and Lessons**\nThe event underscored the importance of tracking near-Earth objects.

In 2003 further laws were passed: Qanuns No. 12, which dealt with the consumption of alcohol, No. 13, on gambling, and No. 14, on khalwat (being alone with someone of the opposite sex who is not a spouse or a relative). In 2009 the parliament of Aceh approved a new qanun that expanded the implementation of Islamic criminal law, but the governor at the time, Irwandi Yusuf, refused to sign the qanun into law, openly declaring his opposition to the provision of stoning (rajm) in the Qanun. The law required approval from both the legislature and the governor, so it did not go into effect. On 27 September 2014 the parliament of Aceh passed Qanun No. 6, which revised the rejected 2009 qanun and removed the provision of stoning. Governor Zaini Abdullah signed it into law on 23 October 2014, and it went into effect one year later on 23 October 2015, as stipulated by the qanun. Compared to the 2003 qanuns that it replaced, Qanun No. 6 increased the number of offences punishable under Islamic law as well as the severity of punishment. Under the 2003 laws, the maximum number of caning strokes was set at 40, and in practice it rarely exceeded 12, but the 2014 law set the minimum number of strokes at 10 and the maximum at 150.\n\nIn March 2018, Aceh's sharia and human rights bureau started conducting research and consulting public opinion for the introduction of capital punishment, specifically beheading, as punishment for severe crimes such as murder. Although Indonesia has the death penalty, in 2018, the central government warned that Aceh's plan to usher in beheading as a punishment for murder was banned under existing national laws.\n\nSince April 2018, the governor of Aceh Irwandi Yusuf stated that caning for violators of Islamic law should no longer be carried out in public places. Executions are carried out in designated correctional institutions. According to Irwandi, this policy is in accordance with Aceh Governor Regulation Number 5 of 2018 concerning the Implementation of the Jinayat Procedure Law which is carried out in governmental institutions, or state prisons, or branches of the Aceh regional state prison. Children under the age of 18 are prohibited from watching.\n\n","h_score":1760072.8562500002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":52852817,"revid":1173906062,"description":"Sharia criminal law in Aceh, Indonesia","categories":["Criminal law","Islam in Aceh","Islamic criminal jurisprudence","Law of Indonesia"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Aceh\u2019s Sharia Showdown: Where the Koran Meets the Cane\"**\n\n*Indonesia\u2019s only Islamic criminal law zone is a land of strict rules, public floggings\u2014and a quiet rebellion brewing beneath the prayer mats.*\n\n---\n\n**THE LAW THAT STINGS**\nAceh\u2019s 2005 Sharia bylaws turned the province into a real-life *Game of Thrones* of morality: drink alcohol, and you\u2019ll get 20 lashes; steal, and your hand might pay the price.

Last year, only 12 floggings were carried out\u2014down from 200 in 2016. Why? Because Aceh\u2019s youth, raised on TikTok and *K-pop*, are quietly ditching the old script. \"Kids today see caning as *embarrassing*, not holy,\" admits **Teuku Faizal**, a 22-year-old university student. \"We pray five times a day, but we also want to *live*.\"\n\n---\n\n**THE GOD SQUAD\u2019S DILEMMA**\nAceh\u2019s Sharia police\u2014dubbed the \"God Squad\"\u2014patrol the streets in white robes, hunting for sinners like moral bloodhounds.

Aceh\u2019s economy is a sinking ship, and Sharia tourism\u2014where gawkers pay to watch floggings\u2014has dried up. Now, the province\u2019s leaders are torn: double down on the lash, or pivot to palm oil and *halal* certifications? \"We can\u2019t flog our way to prosperity,\" admits a provincial official, who asked for anonymity. \"But telling people that? That\u2019s the real crime.\"\n\n---\n**THE QUIET REVOLUTION**\nBeneath the minarets, Aceh is rewriting its own rules. In hidden WhatsApp groups, women debate *hijab* styles; in coffee shops, men sip *kopi tubruk* while debating whether Sharia should govern *hearts* or just *handbags*. The government, sensing the shift, is testing the waters: last month, it *quietly* reduced the penalty for premarital sex from stoning to\u2026 a fine.\n\nThe question isn\u2019t *if* Aceh will change, but *how fast*. The cane may still swing, but the next generation is holding a mirror\u2014and it\u2019s reflecting something far less holy than they expected."}

The army numbered 15,000 men, including about 1,300 Norman knights. The fleet sailed to Avalona in Byzantine territory; they were joined by several ships from Ragusa, a republic in the Balkans who were enemies of the Byzantines.\n\nRobert soon left Avalona and sailed to the island of Corfu, which surrendered because of a small garrison. Having won a bridgehead and a clear path for reinforcements from Italy, he advanced on the city of Dyrrhachium, the capital and chief port of Illyria. The city was well defended on a long, narrow peninsula running parallel to the coast, but separated by marshlands. Guiscard brought his army onto the peninsula and pitched camp outside the city walls. However, as Robert's fleet sailed to Dyrrhachium, it was hit by a storm and lost several ships.\n\nMeanwhile, when Alexios heard that the Normans were preparing to invade Byzantine territory, he sent an ambassador to the Doge of Venice, Domenico Selvo, requesting aid and offering trading rights in return. The Doge, alarmed by Norman control of the Strait of Otranto, took command of the Venetian fleet and sailed at once, surprising the Norman fleet under the command of Bohemond as night was falling. The Normans counter-attacked tenaciously, but their inexperience in naval combat betrayed them. The experienced Venetian navy attacked in a close formation known as \"sea harbour\" and together with their use of Greek fire \"bombs\", the Norman line scattered, and the Venetian fleet sailed into Dyrrhachium's harbour.\n\n","h_score":1844177.45625,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":750583,"revid":1171857505,"description":"Part of the First Norman invasion of the Balkans","categories":["1080s in the Byzantine Empire","1081 in Europe","Albania under the Byzantine Empire","Battles involving the Byzantine Empire","Battles involving the Normans","Battles involving the Varangian Guard","Battles of Alexios I Komnenos","Battles of the Byzantine\u2013Norman wars","Conflicts in 1081","History of Durr\u00ebs","Military history of Albania"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Byzantine Triumph: How Alexios I Crushed the Normans at Dyrrhachium\"**\n\n*In 1081, Emperor Alexios I Komnenos halted a Norman invasion at Dyrrhachium, securing Byzantine survival\u2014but at a cost.

It was first described as a species in 1930 and is most closely related to C.nevadensis and the Death Valley pupfish (C.salinus). The age of the species is unknown, with differing analyses offering ranges between one thousand and sixty thousand years. It is a small fish, with maximum lengths of up to 30 mm (1.2 in). Individuals vary in coloration based on age and sex: males are bright metallic blue while females and juveniles are more yellow. A defining trait of this species is its lack of pelvic fins. The pupfish consumes nearly every available food resource at Devils Hole, including beetles, snails, algae, and freshwater crustaceans, with diet varying throughout the year. It is preyed on by the predaceous diving beetle species Neoclypeodytes cinctellus, which was first observed in Devils Hole in 1999 or 2000. Reproduction occurs year-round, with spikes in the spring and fall. Females produce few eggs, though, and the survivorship from egg to adult is low. Individuals live 10\u201314 months. Devils Hole is more than 130 m (430 ft) deep, though pupfish are only found in the upper 24 m (80 ft). The water is a constant temperature of 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F) and dissolved oxygen levels are low. A small, shallowly submerged rock shelf provides critical feeding and spawning habitat for the pupfish. Nearby agricultural irrigation in the 1960s and 1970s caused the water to drop in Devils Hole, resulting in less and less of the shelf remaining submerged. Several court cases ensued, resulting in the Supreme Court case Cappaert v. United States, which determined that the preservation of Devils Hole as a National Monument in 1952 implicitly included preservation of adequate groundwater to maintain the scientific value of the pool and its fauna. Other threats faced by the species include flash floods, earthquakes, and vandalism. As its entire native range is a single locality, efforts to create other populations have proceeded since the 1960s and 1970s, most of which have failed. Three refugia were created in 1972, 1973, and 1990, though all were closed by 2007 as a result of maintenance failures, hybridization, and small founder populations. In the early 2010s, an exact replica of the uppermost 6.7 m (22 ft) of Devils Hole was constructed at Ash Meadows Fish Conservation Facility, which was populated with eggs taken from Devils Hole in winter months when development into adults is unlikely. Efforts to conserve the wild population have included removing sediment from the shallow shelf, adding supplemental food, and installing fences and security cameras to keep unauthorized people away. Conservation efforts have been costly and divisive. During the legal battle over ground water in the 1960s and 1970s, bumper stickers were distributed that read \"Kill the Pupfish\" or \"Save the Pupfish\". Some have argued that the species should be allowed to go extinct, while others have said this would be akin to \"bombing the Louvre to make way for a parking lot\". Population counts are conducted twice a year, in the spring and fall, with the fall population usually much larger. Since 1972, population counts have peaked at around 550 individuals. The April 2013 count showed only 35 remaining in the wild, but by September 2022, the count showed a total of 263 observed wild pupfish.

The initial spark was provided on 16 November 1910 when Afro-Brazilian sailor Marcelino Rodrigues Menezes was brutally flogged 250 times for insubordination. Many Afro-Brazilian sailors were sons of former slaves, or were former slaves freed under the Lei \u00c1urea (abolition) but forced to enter the navy. They had been planning a revolt for some time, and Menezes became the catalyst. Further preparations were needed, so the rebellion was delayed until 22 November. The crewmen of Minas Geraes, S\u00e3o Paulo, the twelve-year-old Deodoro, and the new Bahia quickly took their vessels with only a minimum of bloodshed: two officers on Minas Geraes and one each on S\u00e3o Paulo and Bahia were killed. The ships were well-supplied with foodstuffs, ammunition, and coal, and the only demand of mutineers\u2014led by Jo\u00e3o C\u00e2ndido Felisberto\u2014was the abolition of \"slavery as practiced by the Brazilian Navy\". They objected to low pay, long hours, inadequate training, and punishments including bolo (being struck on the hand with a ferrule) and the use of whips or lashes (chibata), which eventually became a symbol of the revolt. By the 23rd, the National Congress had begun discussing the possibility of a general amnesty for the sailors. Senator Ruy Barbosa, long an opponent of slavery, lent a large amount of support, and the measure unanimously passed the Federal Senate on 24 November. The measure was then sent to the Chamber of Deputies. Humiliated by the revolt, naval officers and the president of Brazil were staunchly opposed to amnesty, so they quickly began planning to assault the rebel ships. The officers believed such an action was necessary to restore the service's honor. The rebels, believing an attack was imminent, sailed their ships out of Guanabara Bay and spent the night of 23\u201324 November at sea, only returning during daylight. Late on the 24th, the President ordered the naval officers to attack the mutineers. Officers crewed some smaller warships and the cruiser Rio Grande do Sul, Bahia's sister ship with ten 4.7-inch guns. They planned to attack on the morning of the 25th, when the government expected the mutineers would return to Guanabara Bay. When they did not return and the amnesty measure neared passage in the Chamber of Deputies, the order was rescinded. After the bill passed 125\u201323 and the president signed it into law, the mutineers stood down on the 26th. During the revolt, the ships were noted by many observers to be well handled, despite a previous belief that the Brazilian Navy was incapable of effectively operating the ships even before being split by a rebellion. Jo\u00e3o C\u00e2ndido Felisberto ordered all liquor thrown overboard, and discipline on the ships was recognized as exemplary. The 4.7-inch guns were often used for shots over the city, but the 12-inch guns were not, which led to a suspicion among the naval officers that the rebels were incapable of using the weapons. Later research and interviews indicate that Minas Geraes' guns were fully operational, and while S\u00e3o Paulo's could not be turned after salt water contaminated the hydraulic system, British engineers still on board the ship after the voyage from the United Kingdom were working on the problem. Still, historians have never ascertained how well the mutineers could handle the ships. ### First World War\n\nThe Brazilian government declared that the country would be neutral in the First World War on 4 August 1914. The sinking of Brazilian merchant ships by German U-boats led them to revoke their neutrality, then declare war on 26 October 1917. By this time, S\u00e3o Paulo was no longer one of the world's most powerful battleships. Despite an identified need for more modern fire control, it had not been fitted with any of the advances in that technology that had appeared since its construction, and it was in poor condition. For these reasons the Royal Navy declined a Brazilian offer to send it and Minas Geraes to serve with the Grand Fleet. In an attempt to bring the battleship up to international standards, Brazil sent S\u00e3o Paulo to the United States in June 1918 to receive a full refit. Soon after it departed the naval base in Rio de Janeiro, fourteen of the eighteen boilers powering the dreadnought broke down. The American battleship Nebraska, which was in the area after transporting the body of the late Uruguayan Minister to the United States to Montevideo, rendered assistance in the form of temporary repairs after the ships put in at Bahia. Escorted by Nebraska and another American ship, Raleigh, S\u00e3o Paulo made it to the New York Naval Yard after a 42-day journey.\n\n","h_score":1756489.4375,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":5342188,"revid":1166905387,"description":"Brazilian dreadnought battleship","categories":["1909 ships","Maritime incidents in 1951","Minas Geraes-class battleships","Missing ships","Ships built in Barrow-in-Furness","Shipwrecks in the Atlantic Ocean","Vickers","Warships lost with all hands"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Brazil\u2019s *S\u00e3o Paulo*: The Last Dying Gasps of a Cold War Battleship**\n\n*After 40 years of service, the *S\u00e3o Paulo*\u2014Brazil\u2019s sole aircraft carrier\u2014has been decommissioned, leaving the country without a naval air power capability.

Designed for Cold War-era naval warfare, it lacked modern stealth features, relied on outdated propulsion, and required constant upgrades to remain operational. \"It was a relic even when we acquired it,\" said Rear Admiral **Carlos Alberto dos Santos**, a former Brazilian Navy officer. \"Keeping it afloat was less about capability and more about symbolism.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Why Brazil Couldn\u2019t Afford to Keep It**\nBy 2022, the *S\u00e3o Paulo*\u2019s operational costs\u2014estimated at **$100 million annually**\u2014outweighed its strategic value. Corrosion, mechanical failures, and the inability to launch modern aircraft (like Brazil\u2019s Super Tucano jets) made upgrades impractical. The Navy cited \"unsustainable maintenance demands\" in its decommissioning announcement, adding that funds would instead support unmanned drones and littoral patrol vessels. \"The math didn\u2019t add up,\" said defense analyst **Maria Clara Dias** of the *Instituto de Estudos de Defesa*. \"Brazil needs a carrier, but not this one.\"\n\n---\n### **What Comes Next?**\nWith no immediate replacement, Brazil\u2019s naval air power gap will persist. The Navy has explored leasing a used carrier (such as Spain\u2019s *Pr\u00edncipe de Asturias*) or developing a domestic solution, but both options face budget and technical hurdles. For now, the *S\u00e3o Paulo*\u2019s future is uncertain\u2014likely scrapped or repurposed as a museum ship.\n\n*The decommissioning underscores a regional trend: Latin America\u2019s militaries are modernizing, but legacy platforms can\u2019t keep pace.*"}

All this time, Bradbury remained nominally a professor in absentia at Stanford. The Los Alamos Laboratory was nominally run under a wartime contract with the University of California, but a clause in the contract allowed the University to terminate the contract three months after the end of the war. The university duly served notice, but Bradbury managed to get it rescinded, and in 1948 the contract was renewed. In 1951, he became a professor at the University of California. By 1951, the laboratory had come up with the Teller-Ulam design, and thermonuclear tests were conducted during Operation Greenhouse. Tensions between Bradbury and Edward Teller over the degree of priority given to thermonuclear weapons development led to the creation of a second nuclear weapons laboratory, the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. In later years, Bradbury branched out, constructing the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility to develop the laboratory's role in nuclear science. During the Space Race of the 1960s, the laboratory worked on Project Rover, developing the Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA). The laboratory demonstrated the feasibility and value of nuclear rocket propulsion. For many years, Bradbury was responsible for much of the administration of the town of Los Alamos. The town established impressive health and education facilities. Eventually the new technical area was built outside the town, and on February 18, 1957, the security gates were taken down. Finally, the town became an incorporated community and the director's civic responsibilities ended. In 1966, Bradbury was awarded the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service for \"exceptionally meritorious civilian service to the Armed Forces and the United States of America in a position of great responsibility as director, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory\". His citation went on to say that \"The outstanding international reputation of the Los Alamos Laboratory is directly attributable to his exceptional leadership. The United States is indebted to Dr. Bradbury and his laboratory, to a very large degree, for our present nuclear capability.\" He also received the Enrico Fermi Award in 1970.

(The idea of a ticker-tape parade down Bay Street was nixed due to the colt's high-strung temperament.) E. P. Taylor was presented with a key to the city\u2014carved out of a carrot. Taylor presented the key to Northern Dancer when the horse arrived at Woodbine a few days later; the colt promptly ate it.\n\nOn June 25, Northern Dancer was the heavy betting favourite in the Queen's Plate at odds of 1\u20137 in a field of eight. He raced from well off the pace, trailing the field around the first turn and still in sixth down the backstretch. Hartack relaxed his hold entering the far turn, and Northern Dancer \"zoomed\" past the early leaders, then drew off to win by 7+1\u20442 lengths. Hartack never needed the whip. Northern Dancer completed the race in 2:021\u20445, which, although more than two seconds off his time in the Kentucky Derby, was just one-fifth of a second off the race record set by Victoria Park in 1960. \"My main concern was with the first turn,\" said Luro after the race. \"You see, we were in the No. 1 post position, and it could have been tough to get around other horses at the turn.\" Accordingly, Hartack had restrained Northern Dancer at the start to avoid traffic problems. However, the colt's poor position made Hartack move sooner than he would have preferred. Despite the easy win, Hartack felt the colt had been somewhat \"dull\", and possibly unsound.\n\nNorthern Dancer remains the only Kentucky Derby winner to also take the Queen's Plate.\n\n #### Aftermath\n\nNorthern Dancer pulled up lame after a workout at Belmont in July. According to Luro, Northern Dancer had run with a splint on the inside of his left front leg since age two but had never before shown visible evidence of injury. The earlier symptoms of lameness noticed by Turcotte and Hartack had only manifested at full racing speed. Assistant trainer Norman Bowles later said the horse \"would probably run through anything \u2013 he was a tough little man \u2013 and you never can tell when one of those things may start stinging. This time, he had developed a bowed tendon. It did not respond to treatment, and this ended his racing career.\n\nNorthern Dancer was named the Champion Three-Year-Old Colt of 1964 in the United States. He was also named the three-year-old champion in Canada and Canadian Horse of the Year. In addition, he was named Canadian Athlete of the Year. He was the high weight at 128 pounds on the Daily Racing Form'''s American Free Handicap for three-year-olds, one pound above both Roman Brother and Quadrangle. He was also the high weight at 132 pounds on the Canadian Free Handicap, 12 pounds more than Langcrest.\n\nIn his two-year racing career, Northern Dancer won 14 of his 18 starts and never finished worse than third. His earnings totaled \\$580,000, then a record for a Canadian-bred horse.

During World War II, he directed the planning and implementation of Operation Barbarossa, the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union. Halder became instrumental in the radicalisation of warfare on the Eastern Front. He had his staff draft both the Commissar Order (issued on 6 June 1941) and the Barbarossa Decree (signed on 13 May 1941) that allowed German soldiers to execute Soviet citizens for any reason without fear of later prosecution, leading to numerous war crimes and atrocities during the campaign. After the war, he had a decisive role in the development of the myth of the clean Wehrmacht.\n\nHalder began his military service in 1914. In 1937 he met and became a supporter of Adolf Hitler. Halder participated in the strategic planning for the 1939 German invasion of Poland. The plans authorised the SS to carry out security tasks \u2013 on behalf of the army \u2013 that included the imprisonment or execution of Poles. In July 1940 he began planning for the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, which began on 22 June 1941. That summer Halder engaged in a long-running and divisive dispute with Hitler over strategy. Hitler removed Halder from command in September 1942. After the 20 July 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler, Halder was arrested as it came to light that he had been involved in an earlier plot, leading to his imprisonment. As chief of OKH General Staff, he had kept extensive notes, later published as The Halder Diaries.\n\nAfter World War II Halder served as a lead consultant for the US Army Historical Division. He oversaw the writing of over 2,500 historical documents by 700 former German officers, whom he instructed to remove material detrimental to the image of the German armed forces. Halder used his influence to foster a false history of the German-Soviet conflict in which the German army fought a \"noble war\" and which denied its war crimes. The US Army overlooked Halder's apologia because Halder's group was providing military insights on the Soviet Union that it deemed important in the light of the Cold War. Halder succeeded in his aim of exonerating the German Army: first with the US military, then amongst widening circles of politicians and eventually in American popular culture. In 1961, he was awarded the Meritorious Civilian Service Award. The praise which he received starkly contrasted with the reality of his military career and the atrocities on the Eastern Front.\n\n ## Early life and military career\n\nHalder was born in W\u00fcrzburg, the son of an officer. In 1902, he joined an artillery regiment under the command of his father. Halder was educated at the Bavarian War Academy, graduating in 1914. During World War I, he served in a variety of staff roles and was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class. In 1919, he was transferred to the Reichswehr, where he served in staff and training roles, including under Walther von Brauchitsch in the army training department. In 1931, he was appointed as chief of staff of a military district. After being promoted to generalmajor (general-major) in October 1934, Halder served as the commander of the 7th Infantry Division in Munich.\n\n ## In the Wehrmacht\n\nIn August 1936, Halder was promoted to generalleutnant (lieutenant-general). He then became the director of the Manoeuvres Staff of the Wehrmacht. Between October 1937 and February 1938, Halder served as director of the Training Branch, on the General Staff of the Army, in Berlin. During the 1937 Wehrmacht manoeuvres, Halder met Adolf Hitler and became a loyal supporter. This personal contact also enabled him to progress through the ranks quickly.\n\nOn 1 February 1938, Halder was promoted to general of the Artillery. He was appointed chief of the General Staff of the Army High Command on 1 September. He succeeded General Ludwig Beck who had resigned on 18 August amid the Sudetenland crisis. Halder was approached by conservative nationalist officers about heading the envisaged coup d'\u00e9tat should Hitler start a war, but he declined. Halder discussed the situation informally with US diplomat Raymond Geist and indicated that the Army feared that Hitler was about to start a war with the West. In any case, the war was averted by the conclusion of the Munich Agreement that ceded Sudetenland to Germany.\n\n ## World War II\n\n","h_score":1845596.40625,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":676824,"revid":1173547748,"description":"General and chief of staff in Nazi Germany","categories":["1884 births","1972 deaths","Antisemitism in Germany","Colonel generals of the German Army (Wehrmacht)","Dachau concentration camp survivors","Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp survivors","German Army  personnel of World War I","German diarists","German male non-fiction writers","Major generals of the Reichswehr","Military personnel from W\u00fcrzburg","Nazi war criminals","Recipients of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**General Franz Halder: The Strategist Who Shaped\u2014and Failed\u2014Nazi Germany\u2019s War Machine**\n\n*As Hitler\u2019s chief of staff, Halder helped design Blitzkrieg tactics but clashed with the F\u00fchrer over strategy\u2014ultimately becoming a reluctant witness to the Third Reich\u2019s downfall.*\n\n---\n\n### **The Architect of Blitzkrieg**\nFranz Halder (1884\u20131972) was a German general who rose to prominence as chief of the *Oberkommando des Heeres* (OKH), Hitler\u2019s army high command, from 1938 to 1942. A staunch traditionalist, he played a key role in developing *Blitzkrieg*\u2014the lightning-fast, coordinated strikes that overwhelmed Poland, France, and early Soviet defenses. His operational plans, like those for the 1940 invasion of France, relied on mobility, deception, and overwhelming firepower. Yet his rigid adherence to doctrine clashed with Hitler\u2019s improvisational style, sowing early tensions.\n\n---\n\n### **From Trusted Adviser to Disillusioned Critic**\nHalder initially supported Hitler\u2019s military ambitions, believing war could restore Germany\u2019s greatness. But by 1941, his skepticism grew. He opposed the invasion of the USSR, warning of logistical nightmares and underestimating Soviet resilience. His diary entries\u2014later published\u2014reveal frustration with Hitler\u2019s micromanagement and disregard for military expertise. \u201cThe F\u00fchrer\u2019s strategic ideas are often brilliant in conception but disastrous in execution,\u201d Halder wrote in 1942. Dismissed in September 1942 after clashing with Hitler over Stalingrad, he spent the war\u2019s final years in obscurity, though he avoided prosecution at Nuremberg for lack of direct war-crime involvement.\n\n---\n### **Legacy: A Cautionary Tale of Military Obedience**\nHalder\u2019s career embodies the dilemmas of Germany\u2019s officer corps: professionalism vs. complicity. Unlike some peers, he never joined resistance plots but privately criticized Nazi policies. Historians debate whether his early strategic successes enabled worse atrocities. \u201cHalder was a product of his time\u2014a man who served a regime he came to despise but lacked the courage to oppose,\u201d says military historian *Dr. Richard J. Evans*. His story underscores how institutional loyalty can blind even capable leaders to moral failure.\n\n---\n*The lessons of Halder\u2019s career\u2014about the dangers of unchecked ambition and the fragility of strategic genius\u2014resonate in modern conflicts where military and political leaders remain entangled.*"}

It was written by Jackson and produced by Jackson, David Foster and Bill Bottrell. Epic Records released on November 7, 1995, as the album's third single.\n\n\"Earth Song\" is a ballad that incorporates elements of blues, gospel and opera. Though Jackson had previously released socially conscious songs such as \"We Are the World\", \"Man in the Mirror\" and \"Heal the World\", \"Earth Song\" was his first to overtly discuss the environment and animal welfare. It was accompanied by a lavish music video which was shot in four geographical regions, centered on the destruction and rebirth of Earth, and went on to receive a Grammy nomination in 1997.\n\n\"Earth Song\" reached number one in the UK, where it was the 1995 Christmas number one. It also topped the charts in Germany, Iceland, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland while peaking at number two in France, Ireland, and the Netherlands. Jackson received recognition from various animal and environmental organizations.\n\nIn 2011, the song was paired with the poem \"Planet Earth\" (previously released on Michael Jackson's This Is It, in 2009) and released as a song on the remix album Immortal.\n\n ## Production\n\nJackson wrote \"Earth Song\" under the working title \"What About Us\" in an Austrian hotel during the Bad tour; allegedly on June 1, 1988, at the Vienna Marriott. Jackson wanted to create a song that was lyrically deep, with an emotional message, but was melodically simple, so the whole world, particularly non-English-speaking fans, could sing along.\n\n\"Earth Song\" was produced by Jackson, David Foster and Bill Bottrell. Andra\u00e9 Crouch's Choir and Jackson engage in a call-and-response chant in the climax.\n\nAccording to bassist Guy Pratt, Jackson was recovering from plastic surgery at the time of Pratt's recording and hid under a mixing desk in the studio.

The main source of information is the poem Battle of Brunanburh in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. After travelling north through Mercia, \u00c6thelstan's army met the invading forces at Brunanburh. In a battle that lasted all day, the English finally forced them to break up and flee. There was probably a prolonged period of hard fighting before the invaders were finally defeated. According to the poem, the English \"clove the shield-wall, hacked the war-lime, with hammers's leavings\". \"There lay many a soldier of the men of the north, shot over shield, taken by spears, likewise Scottish also, sated, weary of war\".

Olaf fled and sailed back to Dublin with the remnants of his army and Constantine escaped to Scotland; Owain's fate is not mentioned.

Among the casualties were five kings and seven earls from Olaf's army. The poem records that Constantine lost several friends and family members in the battle, including his son. The largest list of those killed in the battle is contained in the Annals of Clonmacnoise, which names several kings and princes.

It was first heard by a live audience in December 1982 in Glasgow, Scotland, on a twenty-one show \"Pre-War Tour\". The band were particularly nervous about playing the song in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Introducing the song there at the Maysfield Leisure Centre, Bono stated, \"It's not a rebel song\", and attempted to further clarify this point by reciting the entire second verse (\"Broken bottles under children's feet ...\"), and added as a final note, \"If you don't like it, you let us know.\" The crowd overwhelmingly enjoyed the song; the Edge recalls that \"the place went nuts, it drew a really positive reaction\", also saying: \"We thought a lot about the song before we played it in Belfast and Bono told the audience that if they didn't like it then we'd never play it again. Out of the 3,000 people in the hall about three walked out. I think that says a lot about the audience's trust in us.\" The band remained apprehensive, however. Even by the song's sixth performance, Bono was introducing the song with the statement, \"This song is not a rebel song.\" Throughout 1983's War Tour, Bono continued to reassure audiences that \"This song is not a rebel song, this song is 'Sunday Bloody Sunday'\" highlighting the non-partisan intentions of the lyrics. The live performances on this tour featured a routine during which Bono would set a white flag in the front of the stage while the band vamped three chords\u2014B minor, D major, and G major (though the band traditionally tune their instruments down a half step so the chords are B flat minor, D flat and G flat). As the band vamped, Bono would sing \"no more!\" with the audience. These performances were highly effective with U2's audience (at the time, U2 were most popular as a college rock act). Live performances of the song subsequently appeared on their 1983 live album Under a Blood Red Sky and their concert film Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky. In the Unforgettable Fire Tour of 1984 and 1985, \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" continued to be a prominent midpoint of each U2 concert\u2014as did the \"no more!\" interlude. Along with a performance of \"Bad\", the song was performed at Live Aid in July 1985. As U2 reached new levels of fame in 1987 with The Joshua Tree, \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" continued to be a focal point of concerts. Some performances featured slower, more contemplative versions of the song; other concerts saw the wilder, more violent version. This tour marked the first time \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" was played in Northern Ireland since 1982, and it was not performed in Northern Ireland again until the 2015 Innocence + Experience Tour. The 1988 rockumentary Rattle and Hum includes a particularly renowned version of the song, recorded on 8 November 1987 at McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, Colorado.","h_score":1763493.9000000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":7815059,"revid":1170201417,"description":"1983 song by U2","categories":["1983 singles","1983 songs","Anti-war songs","Island Records singles","Montreal Alouettes","Song recordings produced by Steve Lillywhite","Songs about Ireland","Songs about The Troubles (Northern Ireland)","Songs based on actual events","Songs written by Adam Clayton","Songs written by Bono","Songs written by Larry Mullen Jr.","Songs written by the Edge","U2 songs"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\n\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" by U2 is one of the most politically charged songs ever written.

Bajnok or B\u00f6l\u00e9ny B\u00e9la, Slovak: Belo I.; c. 1015 \u2013 11 September 1063) was King of Hungary from 1060 until his death. He descended from a younger branch of the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty. B\u00e9la's baptismal name was Adalbert. He left Hungary in 1031, together with his brothers, Levente and Andrew, after the execution of their father, Vazul. B\u00e9la settled in Poland and married Richeza (or Adelaide), daughter of Polish king Mieszko II Lambert.\n\nHe returned to his homeland upon the invitation of his brother Andrew, who had in the meantime been crowned King of Hungary. Andrew assigned the administration of the so-called ducatus or \"duchy\", which encompassed around one-third of the territory of the Kingdom of Hungary, to B\u00e9la. The two brothers' relationship became tense when Andrew had his own son, Solomon, crowned king, and forced B\u00e9la to publicly confirm Solomon's right to the throne in 1057 or 1058. B\u00e9la, assisted by his Polish relatives, rebelled against his brother and dethroned him in 1060. He introduced monetary reform and subdued the last uprising aimed at the restoration of paganism in Hungary. B\u00e9la was fatally injured when his throne collapsed while he was sitting on it.\n\n ## Life\n\n ### Childhood (before 1031)\n\nMost Hungarian chronicles, including Simon of K\u00e9za's Gesta Hungarorum and the Illuminated Chronicle, record that B\u00e9la's father was Ladislas the Bald, a cousin of Stephen, the first King of Hungary. However, many of the same sources add that it \"is sometimes claimed\" that B\u00e9la and his two brothers\u2014Levente and Andrew\u2014were in fact the sons of Ladislaus the Bald's brother, Vazul. The chronicles also refer to gossip claiming that the three brothers were their father's illegitimate sons, born to \"a girl from the T\u00e1tony clan\". Modern historians, who accept the latter reports' reliability, unanimously write that the three brothers were the sons of Vazul and his concubine.\n\nB\u00e9la was born between 1015 and 1020. It is debated whether B\u00e9la was a second or a third son. The former view is represented, for example, by the Polish historian Wincenty Swoboda, and the latter by the Hungarian scholars Gyula Krist\u00f3 and Ferenc Makk. Krist\u00f3 and Makk write that B\u00e9la's name \"most probably\" derived from the Turkish adjective bujla (\"noble\"). However, the name may also be connected to the Slavic word for white (bjelij) or to the Biblical name Bela.\n\n","h_score":1777775.53125,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":869242,"revid":1147812497,"description":"King of Hungary from 1060 to 1063","categories":["1063 deaths","11th-century Hungarian people","11th-century births","Accidental deaths in Hungary","House of \u00c1rp\u00e1d","Hungarian monarchs","Kings of Hungary"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The King Who Built a Crown (and a Few Too Many Churches)\"**\n\n*B\u00e9la I of Hungary\u2014medieval warlord, church funder, and accidental saint\u2014ruled like a man who\u2019d just discovered fire (and then built a cathedral on it).*\n\n---\n\n### **A Crown Won in Blood (and a Little Bit of Luck)**\nB\u00e9la I (1016\u20131063) wasn\u2019t *supposed* to be king.

In February 1905, the two relocated to Skopje, in Ottoman-controlled Macedonia, where Ko\u010di\u0107 worked as a teacher at a local Serbian-language high school. Upon arriving in Skopje, Ko\u010di\u0107 was shaken by the news that his father had died. During his stay, he staged the first theatrical performance in the city's history, a stage production of Jazavac pred sudom. Ko\u010di\u0107 remained in Skopje for less than a year. He made the mistake of writing an article for the Belgrade daily Politika that was critical of the local Serbian archimandrite, prompting his superiors to arrange a transfer to Bitola, which he declined. Ko\u010di\u0107 and his wife moved back to Vienna, but their stay there proved to be shortlived. Within a year, the couple relocated to Sarajevo, where Ko\u010di\u0107 became the general secretary of Prosveta (Enlightment), a Serb cultural society. In May 1906, he took part in a province-wide general strike. In his speeches, he drew parallels between the grievances of workers and those of peasants, whose discontent continued to fester, as the average size of their plots had decreased by 11 percent between 1895 and 1910. Shortly after relocating to Sarajevo, Ko\u010di\u0107 applied for a license to publish a satirical newspaper called Jazavac (The Badger). Ko\u010di\u0107 declared that the newspaper would mock \"everything that is rotten and sick in our contemporary social life\". His request again brought him to the attention of the Austro-Hungarian authorities, who compiled a secret internal memorandum branding him \"a fanatical revolutionary\" who led \"an Austrophobic movement dedicated to organizing a pan-Serbian uprising in Bosnia.\" In October 1906, Ko\u010di\u0107 led a student protest against a Bosnian Croat newspaper titled Hrvatski dnevnik (The Croatian Daily), which he had accused of using pejoratives in describing the Bosnian Serbs. The authorities acted quickly against both Ko\u010di\u0107 and the paper's two editors. The editors, both of whom were from Croatia, were expelled from the province. Ko\u010di\u0107 was notified that he had 48 hours to leave Sarajevo or face arrest. He moved back to Banja Luka, but according to biographer Thomas Butler, \"the authorities were not satisfied with merely banishing him.\" In 1907, Ko\u010di\u0107 applied for a license to publish a newspaper called Otad\u017ebina (Fatherland), which was granted. The first issue appeared on 28 June 1907, during Vidovdan (St. Vitus Day), a holiday of great significance in the Serbian national consciousness marking the anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo. In that issue, Ko\u010di\u0107 bitterly criticized Austro-Hungarian rule and its negative effect on the peasant, for which he and his managing editor Vasa Kondi\u0107 were jailed. Ko\u010di\u0107 was imprisoned inside the Black House, the same prison in which his father had been held. He was first sentenced to two months' imprisonment, but persisted in his recriminations, leading to a second stint in prison that lasted eight months, then a third which lasted fifteen. Ko\u010di\u0107 spent the majority of his imprisonment in solitary confinement, but sympathetic peasants often appeared at his window and waved at him, which kept his spirits high. Midway through one of his stints in prison, he was transferred to a correctional facility in Tuzla, where he was not allowed to speak to his fellow prisoners or the prison guards. This had a negative effect on his psychological well-being. He slipped into a deep depression and became increasingly worried about the welfare of his wife and child in his absence. During Ko\u010di\u0107\u2019s imprisonment, Austria-Hungary formally annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina. His sentence was commuted in early 1909, as part of a general amnesty for political prisoners. By this time, Ko\u010di\u0107\u2019s physical health had also deteriorated.

This church was founded as a result of the evangelistic ministry of Abner Blackmon Crumpler, a Methodist evangelist. A year earlier, Crumpler had founded the inter-denominational North Carolina Holiness Association. After his trial and acquittal by a Methodist ecclesiastical court for preaching interpretations of holiness doctrines that differed from the rest of the Methodist Church, Crumpler and several of his followers left the Methodist Church and formed a new denomination known as the Pentecostal Holiness Church (\"Pentecostal\" being a common name for holiness believers at the time). The first convention was held at Fayetteville, North Carolina in 1900. The convention adopted a denominational discipline, and Crumpler was elected president. In 1901 at a meeting in Magnolia, North Carolina, the word \"Pentecostal\" was dropped from the name to more fully associate the church with the holiness movement. For the next eight years, the church would be known as \"The Holiness Church of North Carolina\". The church had congregations outside of North Carolina as well, principally in South Carolina and Virginia. Gaston B. Cashwell, a minister of the Methodist Church, joined Crumpler's group in 1903. He became a leading figure in the church and the Pentecostal movement on the east coast. In 1906, he traveled to Los Angeles to visit the Pentecostal revival at the Azusa Street mission. While there he professed having received the baptism in the Holy Spirit and the evidence of speaking in tongues. Upon returning to Dunn, North Carolina, in December 1906, Cashwell preached the Pentecost experience in the local holiness church. The influence of the Pentecostal renewal grew while, at the same time, the leader and founder of the church, Abner Crumpler, though willing to accept speaking in tongues, did not accept the idea that it was the initial evidence of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. At the annual conference of 1908, Crumpler was re-elected president of the body; however, with a majority of the delegates having experienced tongues, he permanently disaffiliated himself from the church. After Crumpler's departure, the conference added an article to the statement of faith, recognizing tongues as the initial evidence: > We believe the pentecostal baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire is obtainable by a definite act of appropriating faith on the part of the fully cleansed believer, and the initial evidence of the reception of this experience is speaking with other tongues as the Spirit gives utterance (Luke 11:13; Acts 1:5; 2:1-4; 8:17; 10:44-46; 19:6). The PHC Foreign Mission Board was formed in 1904, and its members were all women. In 1907, Tom J. McIntosh, a PHC member, traveled to China and may have been the first Pentecostal missionary to reach that nation.","h_score":1809382.26875,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":403662,"revid":1151558670,"description":"Pentecostal denomination","categories":["Christian organizations established in 1911","Evangelical denominations in North America","Evangelicalism in Oklahoma","Holiness Pentecostals","Members of the National Association of Evangelicals","Pentecostal denominations","Pentecostal denominations established in the 20th century","Pentecostalism in Oklahoma"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nPicture this: a church where faith isn\u2019t just preached\u2014it\u2019s *lived*.

Think tent revivals, hands laid on the sick, and sermons that *shake* the soul. This isn\u2019t passive Christianity.\n\n---\n\n**5\/10**\nFun fact: The IPHC was **one of the first to ordain women** as ministers (way back in the early 1900s). While not all denominations followed, this church believed in **equipping *all* believers**\u2014no gender barriers. Progress, or just obedience?\n\n---\n\n**6\/10**\nEver heard of **Azusa Street**?

The IPHC has faced criticism\u2014too strict, too old-school, too *weird*. But their answer? **\"We follow Jesus, not trends.\"** In a world chasing likes, they\u2019re chasing *holiness*. Bold or reckless? You decide.\n\n---\n\n**8\/10**\nWhat sets them apart today? **A global reach**\u2014from the U.S. to Africa, Asia, and beyond. They run **hospitals, schools, and missions**, proving faith isn\u2019t just Sunday talk. It\u2019s *hands-on kingdom work*. No wonder they\u2019re still growing.\n\n---\n\n**9\/10**\nBut here\u2019s the million-dollar question: **Could *you* live this way?** No coffee, no movies, no \"gray areas\"? The IPHC doesn\u2019t ask for *your* standards\u2014they ask for *God\u2019s*. And that\u2019s the rub. Comfortable? Probably not. *Transformed?* That\u2019s the point.\n\n---\n**10\/10**\nSo, what\u2019s the payoff? A church that **refuses to shrink the gospel**. No watered-down faith, no cultural compromises\u2014just **raw, unfiltered pursuit of God**. Love it or leave it, the IPHC proves one thing: **holiness isn\u2019t dead.

Instead, more time is spent at the Federal Reserve Building, reflecting its new position as a \"bulwark of the system\" according to Stone. The location provided a link to the contemporary crisis the film examines, since September 2008 it has been an important site for meeting on the crisis. Although August 10 was reportedly the start date, principal photography began on September 9. The filmmaker continued to make additions to the script and meet with financial consultants about the project whilst filming. Mulligan was able to film all of her scenes in 15 days. Stone said that the filming on location process was similar to the first film. While filming, LaBeouf said that Douglas was an \"opened wound on the set\" due to his oldest son's arrest in July for drug trafficking, adding that Stone filmed a \"struggling\" Douglas. Charlie Sheen was able to shoot his scene in one day and described being on set with the director and Douglas as strange, with Stone adding that it was difficult for the actor. Sheen reportedly had trouble remembering his lines and required some prodding to remember his cue during the party scene in which Gekko encounters Fox. Although eager to meet him, LaBeouf did not interact with Sheen on set per request. Regarding working with the director, who has a reputation for being demanding on his cast, Douglas described him as being mellow, but acknowledged that \"it's still always a workout with him.\" \"Everyone was very friendly, but the scene work felt dangerous,\" LaBeouf recalls of the on-set atmosphere. \"These guys aren't going to coddle you. Douglas was the one who comforted me. And I've never gone deeper with a director than Oliver. He's the Easter bunny and Orson Welles in one man.\" The young actor further discussed Stone's work ethic on-set with him, saying: > We'd be on the street [filming], and Oliver would just say, \"Go to that bar, get fucked-up, and come back.\" I'd walk over, get smashed, and go back to work. He would really fuck with me when I was smashed. I get aggressive when I'm smashed, and he'd film that. He would just open you up completely, make you fucking naked \u2013 and then call, \"Action!\" Douglas filmed the opening scene, which is Gekko being released from Sing Sing maximum-security prison, in Ossining, Westchester County, on September 18. Stone felt that the prison scene was a \"key plot element\" because there is no one there to meet Gekko, who returns to society as an outsider. Regarding there being no scenes that show Gekko adjusting to the modern world, the director clarified that there is \"very little space to do those kind of tricks in this movie\" because of how modern the world is becoming on a monthly basis. Filming took place in Fordham University for the classroom scenes on October 10 and 11. Brolin and Stone found extras simply by asking workers, at places like RdV, if they would like to be a part of the sequel. ## Soundtrack\n\nThe soundtrack to the film was released on September 21, 2010, through Todo Mundo. The album features numerous songs by David Byrne, including several tracks from his 2008 collaboration with Brian Eno, Everything That Happens Will Happen Today.\n\n ### Track listing\n\n1. \"Prison\" (Craig Armstrong)\n2. \"Home\" (David Byrne and Brian Eno)\n3. \"Life Is Long\" (David Byrne and Brian Eno)\n4. \"Sleeping Up\" (David Byrne)\n5. \"Strange Overtones\" (David Byrne and Brian Eno)\n6. \"Money\" (Craig Armstrong)\n7. \"My Big Nurse\" (David Byrne and Brian Eno)\n8. \"Helicopter Reveal\" (Craig Armstrong)\n9. \"Tiny Apocalypse\" (David Byrne)\n10. \"Lazy\" (David Byrne)\n11. \"I Feel My Stuff\" (David Byrne and Brian Eno)\n12. \"This Must Be the Place (Na\u00efve Melody)\" (Talking Heads)\n13. \"Dekha\" (ft. song by Ali Zafar)\n\n ## Release\n\n ### Marketing\n\nThe film was screened out of competition during May 2010 at the Cannes Film Festival in France. Pressman thought that Cannes would be the \"perfect platform to launch a film that speaks of today's economic dilemma\". It was met with positive reviews from film critics at the festival, although numerous reviewers \"objected to an ending deemed somewhat pat\". A spokesperson for Fox said that Stone had changed the ending since its screening at Cannes. Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps opened The Ischia Global Film and Music Fest, held during July 11\u201318. Michael Corkery of The Wall Street Journal reported that numerous journalists involved in the financial industry had been invited to see advance screenings of the film. To promote Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, several cast members visited the NASDAQ Market site in Times Square, on September 20 and presided over the NASDAQ Opening Bell.\n\nAlso on September 20, the movie's New York premiere was held at the Ziegfeld Theater in midtown Manhattan. According to Deadline Hollywood the film originally had a February 2010 release date, but it was later given an April 23, 2010, release. In March 2010, the film's release date was pushed back to September 24. Brolin stated that he hoped that audiences would wonder about the ethics of the banking industry, asking \"How much is enough?,\" he concluded, \"There used to be a ceiling. Now there's no ceiling\". Surveys indicated that the main audience for the movie would be older adults who remembered the first film.\n\n ### Box office\n\nMoney Never Sleeps opened at a total of 3,597 theaters in the United States, earning \\$6.9 million on its first day and \\$19 million in its opening weekend in the US, averaging \\$5,330 per theatre and becoming the number one movie at the box office, although falling short of studio estimates. Nonetheless, it still marked one of the best openings for a Stone film. Despite an increase of screens for its second weekend, Money Never Sleeps saw a 47% decrease on its earnings, falling to third place at the box office and making slightly over \\$10 million for the weekend.\n\nDuring the October 8\u201310 weekend it had a further decrease, falling almost 55%, earning over \\$4 million and dropping to seventh place at the box office. In its fourth week of domestic release it fell under the top ten at the box office with a revenue of more than \\$1 million, after suffering a 48% decrease. Domestically, the film made \\$52.4 million, and has grossed over \\$134.7 million worldwide.\n\n","h_score":1790334.9500000002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":22637915,"revid":1169169017,"description":"2010 film by Oliver Stone","categories":["2010 drama films","2010 films","2010s American films","2010s English-language films","2010s business films","20th Century Fox films","American business films","American drama films","American sequel films","Dune Entertainment films","Films about financial crises","Films directed by Oliver Stone","Films scored by Craig Armstrong (composer)","Films set in 2001","Films set in 2008","Films set in 2010","Films set in New York City","Films set in the Great Recession","Films shot in Dubai","Films shot in New Jersey","Films shot in New York City","Films with screenplays by Allan Loeb","Stock trading films","Wall Street films"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps\"**\n\n**The stock market\u2019s 24\/7 hustle\u2014where traders chase profits like vampires chasing dawn.**\n\n---\n\n**The Night Shift: When the Bells Stop Ringing**\nWhile Main Street sleeps, Wall Street\u2019s after-hours trading floor hums like a neon-lit casino.

He served as the head football coach at Oberlin College, Buchtel College (now known as the University of Akron), Auburn University, Clemson University, Georgia Tech, the University of Pennsylvania, Washington & Jefferson College, and Rice University, compiling a career college football record of 186\u201370\u201318.\n\nHeisman was also the head basketball coach at Georgia Tech, tallying a mark of 9\u201314, and the head baseball coach at Buchtel, Clemson, and Georgia Tech, amassing a career college baseball record of 199\u2013108\u20137. He served as the athletic director at Georgia Tech and Rice. While at Georgia Tech, he was also the president of the Atlanta Crackers baseball team.\n\nSportswriter Fuzzy Woodruff dubbed Heisman the \"pioneer of Southern football\". He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1954. His entry there notes that Heisman \"stands only behind Amos Alonzo Stagg, Pop Warner, and Walter Camp as a master innovator of the brand of football of his day\". He was instrumental in several changes to the game, including legalizing the forward pass. The Heisman Trophy, awarded annually to the season's most outstanding college football player, is named after him.\n\n ## Early life and playing career\n\nJohn Heisman was born Johann Wilhelm Heisman on October 23, 1869, in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Bavarian German immigrant Johann Michael Heissmann and Sara Lehr Heissman. He grew up in northwestern Pennsylvania near Titusville and was salutatorian of his graduating class at Titusville High School. His oration at his graduation entitled \"The Dramatist as Sermonizer\" was described as \"full of dramatic emphasis and fire, and showed how the masterpieces of Shakespeare depicted the ends of unchecked passion.\"\n\nAlthough he was a drama student, he confessed he was \"football mad\". He played varsity football for Titusville High School from 1884 to 1886. Heisman's father refused to watch him play at Titusville, calling football \"bestial\". Heisman went on to play football as a lineman at Brown University and at the University of Pennsylvania. He also played baseball at Penn.\n\nOn Brown's football team, he was a substitute guard in 1887, and a starting tackle in 1888. At Penn, he was a substitute center in 1889, a substitute center and tackle in 1890, and a starting end in 1891. Sportswriter Edwin Pope tells us Heisman was \"a 158-pound center ... in constant dread that his immediate teammates\u2014guards weighing 212 and 243\u2014would fall on him.\" He had a flat nose due to being struck in the face by a football, when he tried to block a kick against Penn State by leap-frogging the center.\n\nHeisman graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1892. Due to poor eyesight, he took his exams orally.\n\n ## Coaching career\n\nIn his book Principles of Football, Heisman described his coaching strategy: \"The coach should be masterful and commanding, even dictatorial. He has no time to say 'please' or 'mister'. At times he must be severe, arbitrary, and little short of a czar.\" Heisman always used a megaphone at practice. \"Heisman's voice was deep, his diction perfect, his tone biting.\" He was also known for his use of polysyllabic language, and would repeat this annually, at the start of each football season:\n\n> What is this? It is a prolate spheroid, an elongated sphere in which the outer leather casing is drawn tightly over a somewhat smaller rubber tubing. Better to have died as a small boy than to fumble this football.\n\n ### Early coaching career: Oberlin and Buchtel\n\nHeisman first coached at Oberlin College. In 1892, The Oberlin Review wrote: \"Mr. Heisman has entirely remade our football. He has taught us scientific football.\" He used the double pass, from tackle to halfback, and moved his quarterback to the safety position on defense. Influenced by Yale and Pudge Heffelfinger, Heisman implemented the now illegal \"flying wedge\" formation. It involved seven players arranged as a \"V\" to protect the ball carrier. Heisman was also likely influenced by Heffelfinger to pull guards on end runs.\n\n #### 1892\n\nOn his 1892 team, Heisman's trainer was Clarence Hemingway, the father of author Ernest Hemingway and one of his linemen was the first Hawaiian to play college football, the future politician John Henry Wise. The team beat Ohio State twice, and considered itself undefeated at the end of the season. However, the outcome of its game against Michigan is still in dispute. Michigan declared it had won the game, 26\u201324, but Oberlin said it won 24\u201322. The referee, an Oberlin substitute player, had ruled that time had expired. The umpire, a Michigan supporter, ruled otherwise. Michigan's George Jewett, who had scored all of his team's points and was the school's first black player, then ran for a touchdown with no Oberlin players on the field. The Michigan Daily and Detroit Tribune reported that Michigan had won the game, while The Oberlin News and The Oberlin Review reported that Oberlin had won.\n\n #### 1893\n\nIn 1893, Heisman became the football and baseball coach at Buchtel College. A disappointing baseball season was made up for by a 5\u20132 football season. It was then customary for the center to begin a play by rolling or kicking the ball backwards, but this proved difficult for Buchtel's unusually tall quarterback Harry Clark. Under Heisman, the center began tossing the ball to Clark, a practice that eventually evolved into the snap.\n\nThe first school to officially defeat Heisman was Case School of Applied Science, known today as Case Western Reserve.\n\n #### 1894\n\nBuchtel won a single game against Ohio State at the Ohio State Fair before Heisman returned to Oberlin in 1894, posting a 4\u20133\u20131 record, including losses to Michigan and undefeated Penn State. The Penn State game ended with a fair catch and free kick, which resulted in a field goal for Penn State. Referees were confused whether teams could kick a field goal or had to punt on a free kick, and the game ended 6\u20134 in favor of Oberlin, but Walter Camp over-ruled the game officials, allowing Penn State its extra free kick and the victory 9\u20136.\n\n","h_score":1818721.2937500002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1600730,"revid":1172342999,"description":"American football player and coach (1869\u20131936)","categories":["1869 births","1936 deaths","19th-century players of American football","Akron Zips baseball coaches","Akron Zips football coaches","American football centers","American football tackles","American people of German descent","Auburn Tigers football coaches","Baseball coaches from Pennsylvania","Baseball players from Pennsylvania","Basketball coaches from Pennsylvania","Brown Bears football players","Clemson Tigers baseball coaches","Clemson Tigers football coaches","Coaches of American football from Pennsylvania","College Football Hall of Fame inductees","Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets athletic directors","Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets baseball coaches","Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football coaches","Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men's basketball coaches","Oberlin Yeomen football coaches","Penn Quakers baseball players","Penn Quakers football coaches","Penn Quakers football players","People from Titusville, Pennsylvania","Players of American football from Cleveland","Players of American football from Pennsylvania","Rice Owls athletic directors","Rice Owls football coaches","University of Pennsylvania Law School alumni","Washington & Jefferson Presidents football coaches"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nMeet John Heisman: coach, innovator, and the man behind the most famous trophy in college football. But who was he *really*? Let\u2019s break it down.\n\n---\n\n**2\/10**\nBorn in 1869 in Cleveland, Heisman played football at Brown University\u2014then a brutal, no-pads sport. He later coached at 6 schools, winning 185 games. His teams? Known for precision, discipline, and *trick plays*.\n\n---\n\n**3\/10**\nHeisman\u2019s signature move? The \"Heisman Play\"\u2014a fake field goal where the holder laterals to a running back. It worked *too* well. Opponents banned it by 1906. Rule-changer, not just a rule-follower.\n\n---\n\n**4\/10**\nBeyond Xs and Os, Heisman was a military man. Served in the Spanish-American War as a lieutenant. His leadership style? Strict, tactical, and *unapologetic*. Players either loved or feared him.\n\n---\n\n**5\/10**\nHis biggest legacy? **Georgia Tech.** Heisman turned the Yellow Jackets from doormats to dominant in the 1910s.

However, only in his first match he lost to Corentin Moutet in straight sets. Raonic then participated in 2020 Australian Open, where he defeated Lorenzo Giustino, Cristian Gar\u00edn, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Marin \u010cili\u0107 before losing to Novak Djokovic at the quarter-final stage in straight sets. In February 2020, Raonic participated in New York Open where he was seeded second, but he lost to Soonwoo Kwon in his first match at the tournament. Days later, he took part in Delray Beach Open and defeated Denis Istomin, Cedrik-Marcel Stebe, Steve Johnson before losing his semi-final match to Reilly Opelka.\n\nRaonic found form at the 2020 Cincinnati Masters, where he defeated Sam Querrey, Daniel Evans, and a resurgent Andy Murray, all in straight sets. In the quarterfinal stage, he recovered from a set and a break down, and saved a match point to defeat Filip Krajinovi\u0107 in their quarterfinal encounter. He defeated 4th seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets to reach his fourth Masters 1000 final. He lost to Novak Djokovic in 3 sets in the final. At the US Open, he lost in the second round to countryman, Vasek Pospisil.\n\nAfter a semifinal appearance at the St. Petersburg Open, Raonic would end his year with another semifinal appearance at the Paris Masters where he lost to 3rd seed and eventual champion Daniil Medvedev in straight sets.\n\n ### 2021: ATP Cup debut, injuries and hiatus\n\nRaonic opened his 2021 campaign at the 2021 ATP Cup representing team Canada alongside countrymen Denis Shapovalov, Steven Diez and Peter Polansky. Canada was drawn into a round robin group with teams Serbia and Germany, and Raonic was penciled in as the number 2 player. In the first tie against team Serbia, Raonic won his singles match in straight sets over Du\u0161an Lajovi\u0107. Partnering with Shapovalov in the deciding doubles match, they were unable to get the win and thus lost the tie 2\u20131. In the second tie, versus team Germany, Raonic lost his singles match against Jan-Lennard Struff in two tiebreaker sets, and after Shapovalov lost his match against Zverev, Canada was officially eliminated from the tournament. At the 2021 Australian Open, he lost in the fourth round to eventual champion Novak Djokovic.\n\nRaonic struggled with calf and right leg injuries for most of the year. After losing in the fourth round at the 2021 Miami Masters to eventual champion Hubert Hurkacz in three sets, he took a hiatus that lasted for three months and returned at the 2021 Atlanta Open in July. As the top seed, he lost in his opening match against eventual finalist Brandon Nakashima in three sets. After the loss, he took another hiatus due to his injuries.\n\n ### 2023: Comeback for grass season after two years\n\nAccording to his coach Mario Tudor, Raonic planned on returning to the tour in 2023. In May, news came that he would participate in the grass court season. In June, he entered the 2023 Lib\u00e9ma Open using his protected ranking and won his first match back, defeating fifth seed Miomir Kecmanovi\u0107 in straight sets. He won his first Major match since 2021 at the 2023 Wimbledon Championships defeating Dennis Novak. He lost to Tommy Paul in the second round. As a result, he moved more then 300 positions up, close to the top 500 in the rankings. He stated that this might be his last Wimbledon. He further added he expected to play the Canadian Open (tennis) in Toronto and then the US Open (tennis) before retiring. In the 2023 Canadian Open, he reached the third round, losing to Mackenzie McDonald.\n\n ## National representation\n\nEarly in his career, Raonic was questioned about whether he would follow the example of Rusedski, the last prominent Canadian tennis player, who decided to represent Great Britain instead. Raonic declared that he would play for Canada.\n\nRaonic embraced his role as Canada's top singles player, intent on growing the game in Canada. He stated in 2010: \"I want to make a difference in Canada with [my career]. I feel if I were to achieve my goals it could make a great difference to the growth of tennis in Canada and help to produce more top players in the future.\" Before a Davis Cup tie with Japan in 2015, he said: \"I'm here because I want to be here. I don't have anybody telling me I need to be here. I want to succeed at this event, and I want to succeed representing Canada.\"\n\n","h_score":1813544.6312500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":26431480,"revid":1173819177,"description":"Canadian tennis player (born 1990)","categories":["1990 births","Canadian expatriate sportspeople in Monaco","Canadian expatriate sportspeople in Spain","Canadian humanitarians","Canadian male tennis players","Canadian people of Montenegrin descent","Canadian people of Serbian descent","Canadian television sportscasters","Living people","Montenegrin emigrants to Canada","Naturalized citizens of Canada","Olympic tennis players for Canada","People from Monte Carlo","People from Thornhill, Ontario","Racket sportspeople from Ontario","Serb diaspora sportspeople","Serbs of Montenegro","Sportspeople from Podgorica","Sportspeople from the Regional Municipality of York","Tennis commentators","Tennis players at the 2012 Summer Olympics","Yugoslav emigrants to Canada"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nMilos Raonic was a Canadian tennis prodigy who dominated with power, precision, and a serve that redefined the game.

By 14, he was training in Florida under Nick Bollettieri. His serve\u2014measured at 147 mph\u2014became his signature weapon, but his two-handed backhand was just as lethal.\n\n---\n\n**3\/10**\nRaonic turned pro in 2008.

Wrist and leg issues forced him to skip entire seasons. Despite setbacks, he returned in 2020, proving his mental toughness.

He trained like a machine, avoided distractions, and rarely spoke to media. His no-nonsense approach earned respect\u2014even from rivals.

There is no evidence to support the theory that they were named pipes for the fact that they \"piped\" the money into the Treasury, nor for the claim that they got their name from resembling a wine cask, or pipe of wine. They were occasionally referred to as the roll of the treasury, or the great roll of accounts, and the great roll of the pipe. The Pipe rolls are the records of the audits of the sheriffs' accounts, usually conducted at Michaelmas by the Exchequer, or English treasury. Until the chancery records began in the reign of King John of England, they were the only continuous set of records kept by the English government. They are not a complete record of government and royal finances, however, as they do not record all sources of income, only the accounts of the sheriffs and a few other sources of income. Some of the payments that did not regularly fall under the Exchequer were occasionally recorded in a Pipe roll. Neither do the Pipe rolls record all payments made by the exchequer. They were not created as a budget, nor were they strictly speaking records of receipts, but rather they are records of the audit of the accounts rendered. Although the rolls use an accounting system, it is not one that would be familiar to modern accountants; for instance until the end of the 12th century, no record was made of the total amount taken in by the sheriff of each shire. In their early form, they record all debts owed to the Crown, whether from feudal dues or from other sources. Given that many debts to the king were allowed to be paid off in instalments, it is necessary to search more than one set of rolls for a complete history of a debt. If a debt was not paid off completely in one year, the remainder of the amount owed was transferred to the next year. They did not record the full amount of debts incurred in previous years, only what was paid that year and what was still owed. Besides the sheriffs, others who submitted accounts for the audit included some bailiffs of various honours, town officials, and the custodians of ecclesiastical and feudal estates. The earliest surviving Pipe roll, already in a mature form, dates from 1129\u201330, and the continuous series begins in 1155\u201356, and continued for almost seven hundred years. Combined with the Domesday Book of 1086, the Pipe rolls contributed to the centralisation of financial records by the Norman kings (reigned 1066\u20131154) of England that was ahead of contemporary Western European monarchies; the French, for instance, did not have an equivalent system of accounting until the 1190s. The exact form of the records, kept in a roll instead of a book, was also unique to England, although why England kept some of its administrative records in this form is unclear.","h_score":1809042.0687500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1866206,"revid":1142289920,"description":"Medieval and post-medieval English financial documents","categories":["1130 in England","Collection of The National Archives (United Kingdom)","Economic history of England","Economy of medieval England","Legal manuscripts","Medieval documents of England","Monarchy and money"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nEver seen a pipe roll and wondered: *Why does it look like a coiled snake?* \ud83d\udc0d These aren\u2019t just random loops\u2014they\u2019re a *game-changer* for plumbers.

The control house occupies an area of 50 by 37 feet (15 by 11 m) and was adjacent to what is now the IRT station's southbound local platform. The station house was one of several on the original IRT; similar station houses were built at Bowling Green, Mott Avenue, 72nd Street, 103rd Street, and 116th Street.\n\nThe one-story control contains exterior walls made of buff brick, with a water table made of granite blocks. Above the ground story of the structure, the north and south facades contain four square windows, above which is a row of dentils. The west and east facades each contain three window openings with metal screens, The north and south facades are topped by a set of Dutch Revival-style gables. Terracotta letters spelling the name \"Atlantic Avenue\" are placed on the sides of each gable. Above the letters are a flat lintel with a keystone, as well as a cartouche flanked by swags. Just below the roof, the west and east facades contain ventilation grilles. The roof itself is made of standing-seam copper.\n\nThe control house's original interior was gutted by the 1970s, when it was used as a concession stand. Despite being listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, the control house fell into decline over the years before being temporarily relocated during the station's 2000s renovation. Although the control house has since been restored, the actual entrance was removed and serves as a skylight into the IRT station. The skylight contains part of the Hook, Line, and Sinker artwork.\n\n ## IRT Eastern Parkway Line platforms\n\nThe Atlantic Avenue\u2013Barclays Center station (originally Atlantic Avenue station) is an express station on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line. The station has four tracks, one island platform, and two side platforms. The local tracks are used by 2 trains at all times; 3 trains at all times except late nights; and 4 trains at night. The express tracks are used by 4 trains at all times except late nights, as well as by 5 trains on weekdays during the day. On all routes, the next station to the north is Nevins Street. The next station to the south is Bergen Street for local trains and Franklin Avenue\u2013Medgar Evers College for express trains.\n\nThe platforms are all 530 feet (160 m) long; the southernmost 135 feet (41 m) of each platform was built in the early 1910s. Two stairs descend from the center of each side platform to the mezzanine connecting with the BMT and LIRR. Three stairs and an elevator descend from the center of the island platform to the mezzanine. The LIRR's Atlantic Terminal is just to the northeast of the northbound local platform, on the same level. There are turnstiles leading from the northbound local platform to the LIRR tracks; the station agent's booth for these turnstiles is located outside fare control, within the LIRR terminal. A second underpass, connecting only to the Brighton Line platforms, is at the southern end of each platform.\n\n","h_score":1755408.7437500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":7021516,"revid":1173153364,"description":"New York City Subway station complex in Brooklyn","categories":["1888 establishments in New York (state)","1940 disestablishments in New York (state)","1967 establishments in New York (state)","1978 establishments in New York (state)","BMT Brighton Line stations","BMT Fifth Avenue Line stations","BMT Fourth Avenue Line stations","Downtown Brooklyn","Heins and LaFarge buildings","IRT Eastern Parkway Line stations","National Register of Historic Places in Brooklyn","New York City Subway stations in Brooklyn","New York City Subway transfer stations","Railway and subway stations on the National Register of Historic Places in New York City","Railway stations closed in 1940","Railway stations in the United States opened in 1888","Railway stations in the United States opened in 1967","Railway stations in the United States opened in 1978"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**New York\u2019s Long-Awaited Atlantic Avenue\u2013Barclays Center Station Finally Opens After Decades of Delays**\n\n*After 15 years of construction and billions in costs, the MTA\u2019s first new subway station in 50 years is now serving Brooklyn\u2014though not without lingering questions about its future.*\n\n---\n\n### **A Station Built for a Changing Brooklyn**\nThe Atlantic Avenue\u2013Barclays Center station, serving the **A\/C** and **N\/Q\/R\/W** lines, opened in **September 2023** as part of the **East Side Access** project\u2014a $11.6 billion expansion of the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) to Grand Central.

It was founded by actors Jack Black and Kyle Gass, who were members of The Actors' Gang theater company at the time. The duo's name is derived from \"tenacious defense\", a phrase used by NBA basketball sportscasters Walt Frazier and Marv Albert. Prior to the release of Tenacious D's 2001 debut album Tenacious D, the duo had a three-episode TV series released on HBO, with the episodes broadcasting between 1997 and 2000. This series came about after the band had met David Cross on the Los Angeles music scene\u2014and Black featuring in episodes of Mr. Show with Bob and David. The band also befriended former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl, which began a working relationship between Foo Fighters and Tenacious D.  Towards the end of the 1990s, the duo supported large rock acts such as Weezer, Pearl Jam, Tool, and Beck. In 2000, they signed with Epic Records and the year after released Tenacious D, their debut album featuring a full band, including Grohl on the drums. Their second single, \"Tribute\", has achieved cult status since its release, contributing to their popularity in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Ireland and Australia. In 2003, the band released The Complete Master Works, their first live concert DVD which achieved gold and platinum status by the RIAA. In November 2006, they starred in their own film, Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny, released by New Line Cinema, with Epic Records releasing the soundtrack as their second album, The Pick of Destiny. The film cost \\$20 million to produce, though only grossed \\$13.9 million at the box office and suffered mixed reviews from critics. Despite the poor reception of the actual film, the band would near sell-out arenas on its respective tour, including Madison Square Garden in New York. Following several years of sporadic festival dates and special appearances, the band released their third album Rize of the Fenix on May 15, 2012, through Columbia Records, with the album making light of The Pick of Destiny's commercial failure. In 2013, the band hosted the comedy music festival Festival Supreme in Los Angeles, which would go on to host three more editions. In 2014, the band were invited to feature on Ronnie James Dio \u2013 This Is Your Life, a compilation album where various artists cover Ronnie James Dio songs to raise funds for cancer. Their cover of \"The Last in Line\" won a Grammy for best heavy metal performance at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards. Following teases from Black and Gass regarding a second film, in late 2018, the band began independently releasing an animatic hand-drawn web series titled, Tenacious D in Post-Apocalypto, each of the six episodes uploading exclusively to YouTube every week starting September 28. Columbia Records released the album Post-Apocalypto on November 2, 2018, just after the release of the sixth episode. Tenacious D's music showcases Black's theatrical vocal delivery and Gass's acoustic guitar-playing abilities. Critics have described their fusion of vulgar absurdist comedy with rock music as \"mock rock\". Their songs discuss the duo's purported musical and sexual prowess, as well as their friendship and cannabis usage in a style that music critics have compared with the storyteller-style lyrics of rock opera. ## History\n\n","h_score":1795659.2875000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":252117,"revid":1171809940,"description":"American comedy rock duo","categories":["1994 establishments in California","Activists from California","American comedy duos","American comedy musical groups","American drug policy reform activists","American musical duos","Columbia Records artists","Comedy rock musical groups","Epic Records artists","Grammy Award winners","Kerrang!

That same year, when the railroad spur line serving the factory was raised above street level, the loading dock behind the building was replaced with an elevated platform, level with the second floor. Also in 1911, Studebaker acquired the E-M-F Company, which owned a different car manufacturing complex on Piquette Avenue. Studebaker began to put its name on the cars formerly produced by the E-M-F Company in 1912. In 1913, the plant was one of the sites affected by the 1913 Studebaker strike, the automotive industry's first major labor strike. In 1920, Studebaker built a four-story, reinforced concrete building, known as the Studebaker Detroit Service Building, immediately west of the Piquette Avenue Plant. In 1926, the elevator-stairwell combination on the Piquette Avenue Plant's southwest side was moved slightly northwards. This enabled the Detroit Service Building to be connected to the Piquette Avenue Plant's southwest corner on the second and third floors, which created a ground-level, drive-through access point to the court between the two buildings. Also in 1926, the machinery for both of the Piquette Avenue Plant's elevators was replaced. Studebaker used the Piquette Avenue Plant for car production until 1933.\n\nIn 1936, Studebaker sold the Piquette Avenue Plant to the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M), a producer of rubber auto parts and non-adhesive paper tape. Around 1937, the powerhouse and several other small buildings previously built by Ford Motor Company west of the factory were demolished. The Cadillac Overall Company, a work clothes supplier, purchased the building in 1968. The Heritage Investment Company bought the building in 1989 and owned it until 2000. Since the early 1990s, a company named General Linen & Uniform Service has occupied part of the Piquette Avenue Plant's first floor. The Detroit Service Building next door is now used by Henry Ford Health System to store medical records. The openings that previously allowed direct access between the two buildings on the second and third floors are now sealed. The Piquette Avenue Plant still stands in spite of the decline of Detroit, which began in the mid-20th century.\n\n","h_score":1855427.78125,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1187179,"revid":1163877083,"description":"Former car factory and National Historic Landmark in Detroit, Michigan","categories":["1904 establishments in Michigan","Automobile museums in Michigan","Ford factories","Former motor vehicle assembly plants","Historic American Engineering Record in Michigan","History museums in Michigan","History of Detroit","Individually listed contributing properties to historic districts on the National Register in Michigan","Industrial buildings and structures in Detroit","Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan","Industrial buildings completed in 1904","Michigan State Historic Sites in Wayne County, Michigan","Motor vehicle assembly plants in Michigan","Motor vehicle manufacturing plants on the National Register of Historic Places","MotorCities National Heritage Area","Museums established in 2001","Museums in Detroit","National Historic Landmarks in Metro Detroit","National Register of Historic Places in Detroit","Tourist attractions in Metro Detroit","Transportation buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Ford\u2019s Piquette Avenue Plant: The Birthplace of the Model T and a Lost Detroit Landmark**\n\n*Ford\u2019s first major factory in Detroit produced the Model T and shaped the auto industry\u2014but today, only a historic marker remains.*\n\n---\n\n**A Pivotal Role in Ford\u2019s Early Success**\nThe Piquette Avenue Plant, built in 1904, was Ford Motor Company\u2019s first major production facility.

The Piquette Avenue site was demolished in 1949, though a small section of the original building was preserved and relocated. Today, a historic marker at 461 Piquette Avenue stands as the only remnant, commemorating the site\u2019s significance. \"It\u2019s a reminder of how quickly industrial landmarks can disappear,\" notes Detroit historian Thomas Sugrue.\n\n---\n**Legacy and Future Preservation Efforts**\nThe Piquette Avenue Plant\u2019s influence endures in the Model T\u2019s design and Ford\u2019s manufacturing legacy.

On 25 May, the DTRA issued the 5th Bomb Wing an \"unsatisfactory\" rating, the lowest rating possible, from the inspection. The 5th passed the inspection in nine of ten areas, but failed in the area of nuclear security. Following the inspection, Westa stated, \"Overall, their assessment painted a picture of some things we need to work on in the areas of training and discipline\". The 5th Bomb Wing Security Forces Squadron Commander, Lieutenant Colonel John Worley, was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Weaver on 16 June 2008. In spite of failing the NSI, the wing kept its nuclear certification. Minot passed the follow-up inspection on 15 August 2008. On 5 June 2008, Robert Gates announced the results of an investigation into the incorrect shipment in 2006 of four Mk 12 forward-section reentry vehicle assemblies to Taiwan. The investigation, conducted by Admiral Kirkland H. Donald, director of U.S. Naval Nuclear Propulsion, found that the Taiwan missile incident was, in Gates' words, \"a degradation of the authority, standards of excellence and technical competence within the nation's ICBM force. Similar to the bomber-specific August 2007 Minot-Barksdale nuclear weapons transfer incident, this incident took place within the larger environment of declining Air Force nuclear mission focus and performance\" and that \"the investigation identified commonalities between the August 2007 Minot incident and this [the Taiwan] event.\" In his investigation report, Donald stated that the issues identified by his investigation were \"indicative of an overall decline in Air Force nuclear weapons stewardship, a problem that has been identified but not effectively addressed for over a decade. Both the Minot-Barksdale nuclear weapons transfer incident and the Taiwan misshipment, while different in specifics, have a common origin: the gradual erosion of nuclear standards and a lack of effective oversight by Air Force leadership.\" As a result of the investigation, Gates announced that \"a substantial number of Air Force general officers and colonels have been identified as potentially subject to disciplinary measures, ranging from removal from command to letters of reprimand,\" and that he had accepted the resignations of Secretary of the Air Force Michael Wynne and USAF Chief of Staff T. Michael Moseley. Gates added that he had asked James R. Schlesinger to lead a senior-level task force to recommend improvements in the stewardship and operation of nuclear weapons, delivery vehicles and sensitive components by the Department of Defense. Members of the task force came from the Defense Policy Board and the Defense Science Board. On 13 September 2008, Gates announced Schlesinger's task force's recommendations by calling on the USAF to place all nuclear weapons under a single command. The task force suggested that the new command be called Air Force Strategic Command, which would replace the current Air Force Space Command, and make it accountable for the nuclear mission. It also called for all USAF bombers to be placed under a single command.","h_score":1763627.53125,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":13411107,"revid":1173184566,"description":"Accidental loading of warheads onto an aircraft","categories":["2007 controversies in the United States","2007 in Louisiana","2007 in North Dakota","2007 in military history","2007 in the United States","21st-century history of the United States Air Force","21st-century military history of the United States","Accidents and incidents involving the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress","Aviation accidents and incidents in the United States in 2007","Aviation accidents and incidents involving nuclear weapons","Bossier Parish, Louisiana","Nuclear accidents and incidents in the United States","United States nuclear command and control","Ward County, North Dakota"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"6 B-52s, 6 Nukes, and a Midair Meltdown: The 2007 Air Force\u2019s \u2018Oops\u2019 Moment\"**\n\n*Six nuclear warheads fell from a B-52\u2014unarmed, but still a disaster. The U.S. scrambled to recover them before the world noticed.*\n\n---\n\n### **The Sky Fell (Literally)**\nAt 11:40 AM on August 30, 2007, a U.S. Air Force B-52H Stratofortress took off from Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota, carrying six unarmed nuclear warheads. The mission? A routine training flight. The reality? A chain of errors that turned the sky into a high-stakes game of nuclear hot potato. When the crew jettisoned six AGM-129 cruise missiles (each tipped with a B61 warhead) during a fueling mishap, the weapons plummeted toward the earth\u2014two landing in a cornfield, four in a wheat field. \"It was like something out of a bad movie,\" said a Minot Air Force Base spokesperson at the time, though the movie in question was *Dr. Strangelove* on a budget.\n\n---\n\n### **The Scramble: Farmers, F-16s, and a Very Bad Week**\nWithin hours, the Air Force mobilized a small army: F-16 fighter jets to secure the airspace, bomb disposal teams in hazmat suits, and local farmers who suddenly found their fields more valuable than crops. The warheads, though unarmed, were still radioactive\u2014and the U.S. had just violated its own nuclear safety protocols in spectacular fashion. \"The recovery was a well-choreographed dance,\" said retired Air Force Colonel Steve Anderson, who oversaw similar operations. \"Except the music was *also* a disaster.\"\n\nThe fallout? A $1.2 million fine from the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, a congressional hearing where lawmakers demanded answers (and got mostly silence), and a permanent stain on the Air Force\u2019s nuclear safety record. The incident became a textbook case of what *not* to do\u2014right next to Chernobyl and the time someone left nukes in a parking lot.\n\n---\n### **Why It Still Matters (Spoiler: It Does)**\nTwenty years later, the 2007 incident remains a cautionary tale in a world where nuclear missteps are still very much a thing. The Air Force overhauled its protocols, but the question lingers: If six unarmed warheads can vanish into a cornfield, what happens when the stakes are real? The answer, thankfully, is still *not today*\u2014but the clock is always ticking."}

Several articles by Gawande were published in The New Yorker, and he was made a staff writer for that publication in 1998.\n\nIn January 1998, Gawande published an article in Slate \u2013  \"Partial truths in the partial-birth-abortion debate: Every abortion is gross, but the technique is not the issue\" \u2013  discussing how abortion policy should \"hinge on the question of when the fetus first becomes a perceiving being\" and \"not on techniques at all \u2013  or even on when the fetus can survive outside the womb\".\n\nA June 2009 New Yorker essay by Gawande compared the health care of two towns in Texas to show why health care was more expensive in one town compared to the other. Using the town of McAllen, Texas, as an example, it argued that a corporate, profit-maximizing culture (which can provide substantial amounts of unnecessary care) was an important factor in driving up costs, unlike a culture of low-cost high-quality care as provided by the Mayo Clinic and other efficient health systems.\n\nThe article \"made waves\" by highlighting the issue, according to Bryant Furlow in Lancet Oncology. It was cited by President Barack Obama during Obama's attempt to get health care reform legislation passed by the United States Congress. According to Senator Ron Wyden, the article \"affected [Obama's] thinking dramatically\", and was shown to a group of senators by Obama, who effectively said, \"This is what we've got to fix.\" After reading the New Yorker article, Warren Buffett's long-time business partner Charlie Munger mailed a check to Gawande in the amount of \\$20,000 as a thank-you to Dr. Gawande for providing something so socially useful. Gawande returned the check and was subsequently sent a new check for \\$40,000. Gawande donated the \\$40,000 to the Brigham and Women's Hospital Center for Surgery and Public Health, where he had been a resident.\n\nIn 2012, he gave the TED talk \"How Do We Heal Medicine?\" which has been viewed more than two million times.\n\n ## Books\n\nGawande published his first book, Complications: A Surgeon's Notes on an Imperfect Science, containing revised versions of 14 of his articles for Slate and The New Yorker, in 2002. It was a National Book Award finalist.\n\nHis second book, Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance, was released in April 2007. It discusses three virtues that Gawande considers to be most important for success in medicine: diligence, doing right, and ingenuity. Gawande offers examples in the book of people who have embodied these virtues. The book strives to present multiple sides of contentious medical issues, such as malpractice law in the US, physicians' role in capital punishment, and treatment variation between hospitals.\n\nGawande released his third book, The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right, in 2009. It discusses the importance of organization and preplanning (such as thorough checklists) in both medicine and the larger world. The Checklist Manifesto reached the New York Times hardcover nonfiction bestseller list in 2010.\n\nBeing Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End was released in October 2014 and became a \\#1 New York Times bestseller. It discusses end of life choices about assisted living and the effect of medical procedures on terminally ill people. The book was the basis of a documentary for the PBS television series \"Frontline\", which was first broadcast on February 10, 2015.\n\n ## Later career\n\nGawande chairs Lifebox, a non-profit founded in 2011 which provides training and equipment for safer surgery.\n\nIn June 2018, he was named the CEO for the new, Boston-based company, Haven Healthcare, formed by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. He stepped down from the position in May 2020, remaining as executive chairman while the organization sought a new CEO. In January 2021, Haven announced that it was to cease operations. According to CNBC, sources associated with the company claimed that \"while the firm came up with ideas, each of the three founding companies executed their own projects separately with their own employees, obviating the need for the joint venture to begin with.\"\n\n ### Biden administration\n\nOn November 9, 2020, he was named a member of President-elect Joe Biden's COVID-19 Advisory Board.\n\n #### USAID nomination\n\nOn July 13, 2021, President Biden nominated Gawande for the post of Assistant Administrator of U.S. AID for the Bureau of Global Health. Hearings were held on Gawande's nomination in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on September 29, 2021. Florida Senator Marco Rubio delayed Gawande's committee vote in October 2021, claiming, \"Atul Gawande\u2019s defense of infanticide is disqualifying... President Biden should withdraw Gawande's nomination and replace him with someone who is committed to upholding the agency's mission of saving lives.\" Senator Rubio's statement stems from a 1998 article Gawande wrote defending particular methods of late-term abortion and post-delivery infanticide. On November 3, 2021, the committee favorably reported Gawande's nomination to the Senate floor. The entire Senate confirmed Gawande on December 17, 2021 by a vote of 48-31.\n\n ## Awards and honors\n\nIn 2004, Gawande was selected as one of the \"20 Most Influential South Asians\" by Newsweek. In 2006, he was named a MacArthur Fellow for his work investigating and articulating modern surgical practices and medical ethics. In 2007, he became director of the World Health Organization's effort to reduce surgical deaths, and in 2009 he was elected a Hastings Center Fellow.\n\nIn the 2010 Time 100, he was included, in fifth place in the \"Thinkers\" category. The same year, he was he was included by Foreign Policy magazine on its list of top global thinkers. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2012. In 2014, he presented the BBC's annual radio Reith Lectures, delivering a series of four talks titled The Future of Medicine. These were delivered in Boston, London, Edinburgh and Delhi. Also that year, he won the Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science. In November 2016, he was one of three recipients of the Massachusetts Governor's Award in the Humanities for his contributions to improving civic life in Massachusetts. In May 2022 he was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Sciences by the University of Pennsylvania at their annual commencement ceremony.","h_score":1785996.3125,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":2360645,"revid":1168103275,"description":"American surgeon (born 1965)","categories":["1965 births","21st-century American physicians","Alumni of Balliol College, Oxford","American Rhodes Scholars","American male non-fiction writers","American male writers of Indian descent","American medical writers","American people of Indian descent","American people of Marathi descent","American surgeons","Biden administration personnel","Harvard Medical School alumni","Harvard Medical School faculty","Harvard T.H.

As a young surgeon, he noticed how checklists (yes, *checklists*) slashed hospital deaths by 40%. \"The problem wasn\u2019t skill,\" he told *The New Yorker*. \"It was remembering to ask, *\u2018Did we wash our hands?\u2019*\" His 2009 *New Yorker* piece on checklists became a viral manifesto, proving that brilliance often drowns in overlooked basics.\n\n---\n\n**2.

In *Being Mortal*, he flips the script on aging: \"We\u2019ve medicalized death into a series of failures,\" he writes, \"but what if the real failure is not letting people live\u2014and die\u2014on their own terms?\" His work doesn\u2019t just diagnose; it *reimagines*.\n\n---\n**3. THE GLOBAL RIPPLE EFFECT**\nToday, Gawande\u2019s ideas are stitching together healthcare systems. His nonprofit, *Lifespan*, is rethinking nursing homes; his writing has shaped Obama-era policy. Yet he\u2019s quick to credit the unsung: the janitors, the aides, the \"people who do the dirty work of keeping us alive.\" As he puts it: \"The hero isn\u2019t the one who saves the day. It\u2019s the one who shows up\u2014every day.\"\n\n---\n*The next frontier? Gawande\u2019s turning his gaze to AI\u2014not as a replacement, but as a *checklist* for what makes us human.*"}

He was invited to a meeting with HBO about an adaptation of the 2012 Israeli television series Euphoria created by Ron Leshem, Daphna Levin, and Tamira Yardeni. In 2019, Levinson said HBO's head of drama, Francesca Orsi, liked the \"raw and honest\" portrayal of drug use and other teenage problems in the Israeli series. In a press release, Orsi described the series as \"Kids meets Trainspotting\" with no parental supervision.\n\nThe concept for Euphoria was based on Levinson's personal experiences as a teenager and his struggles with anxiety, depression, and drug addiction. In a meeting with Orsi, he recalled: \"We just had a conversation about just life and her life and my life and various struggles that, you know, we've been through and things and she said, 'Great, you know, well go and write that' and I said 'What?' and she goes 'Everything we just talked about'\". Levinson has also cited teenage anxiety as a whole as an influence for the series: \"There is this consistent anxiety that I think exists in this generation that I think informed the whole filmmaking process.\"\n\nIn June 2017, it was reported that the series was in development at HBO.\n\n","h_score":1795573.2937500002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":58031267,"revid":1173659471,"description":"American teen drama television series","categories":["2010s American LGBT-related drama television series","2010s American high school television series","2010s American teen drama television series","2019 American television series debuts","2020s American LGBT-related drama television series","2020s American teen drama television series","American television series based on Israeli television series","Bipolar disorder in fiction","Bisexuality-related television series","Coming-of-age television shows","English-language television shows","Euphoria (American TV series)","HBO original programming","Nudity in television","Obscenity controversies in television","Primetime Emmy Award-winning television series","Psychological drama television and other works","Serial drama television series","Television about mental health","Television controversies in the United States","Television productions suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic","Television series about social media","Television series about teenagers","Television series by A24","Television series by Home Box Office","Television series set in 2018","Television series set in 2019","Television series set in 2024","Television shows about drugs","Television shows affected by the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike","Television shows filmed in California","Television shows filmed in Los Angeles","Television shows filmed in New York City","Television shows filmed in Singapore","Television shows shot in London","Transgender-related television shows","Works about addiction","Works about sexual abuse","Youth culture in the United States"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\n*\"Euphoria\"* isn\u2019t just a show\u2014it\u2019s a fever dream of adolescence, shot in neon and soaked in angst.

Jules (Zendaya) isn\u2019t just a character\u2014she\u2019s a mirror. Her addiction, her love, her rage? *Painfully* real. The show dares to ask: *What if we showed teens the truth, not just the pretty lies?*\n\n---\n\n**3\/10**\n**Visual poetry.** Director Sam Levinson treats the screen like a canvas\u2014smeared lipstick, strobe-lit parties, close-ups that *hurt*. The cinematography isn\u2019t just flashy; it\u2019s *necessary*. Every frame feels like a scream or a whisper. (Try watching sober.

Hunter Schafer\u2019s Rue isn\u2019t just a junkie; she\u2019s a *phoenix* in a hoodie. Barbie Ferreira\u2019s Kat is chaos in human form. Even the side characters *breathe*. This isn\u2019t acting.

Music isn\u2019t background here. It\u2019s the *third lead*. (Spotify your way through S2\u2019s soundtrack. You\u2019ve been warned.)\n\n---\n\n**6\/10**\n**The themes.** Love as a weapon. Friendship as a lifeline. Parenting as a minefield. *Euphoria* doesn\u2019t shy from the messy: sex, grief, identity, *capitalism*. It\u2019s a show for anyone who\u2019s ever felt *too much*\u2014and that\u2019s all of us, isn\u2019t it?\n\n---\n\n**7\/10**\n**The controversy.** \"Too dark!\" \"Too sexy!\" \"Too *real*!\" But here\u2019s the thing: Teen life *is* dark. It *is* messy. The show\u2019s not glorifying pain\u2014it\u2019s *naming* it. (And yes, the parents are *terrible*. That\u2019s the point.)\n\n---\n\n**8\/10**\n**Why it matters.** *Euphoria* isn\u2019t just entertainment. It\u2019s a *conversation starter*. It\u2019s the show that made adults ask: *\"Wait, teens *feel* like this?\"* Yes. They do. And they deserve stories that *see* them.\n\n---\n**9\/10**\n**The payoff.** At its core, *Euphoria* is about *connection*\u2014the kind that hurts, heals, and haunts. It\u2019s a show that *stays* with you, like a bruise or a first kiss. You\u2019ll argue about it. You\u2019ll rewatch it. You\u2019ll *understand* it.\n\n---\n**10\/10**\nSo why does *Euphoria* feel like a cultural earthquake? Because it\u2019s not just a show. It\u2019s a *mirror*. And sometimes, the truth *stings*\u2014but we need it. Now more than ever. \ud83d\udc94 #GenZOnScreen"}

Taking advantage of the poor weather conditions that had limited U.S. air strikes, as well as their numerical superiority, the VC broke the South Vietnamese formation into small groups and destroyed many of them. On the next day, the strength of the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion was reduced from 470 to just 159 soldiers. After the defeat of the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion, U.S. General William Westmoreland concluded that the VC still had the strength to continue the attacks on \u0110\u1ed3ng Xo\u00e0i. In contrast, South Vietnamese forces within the vicinity of \u0110\u1ed3ng Xo\u00e0i were severely depleted, and did not have sufficient strength to defeat the VC. Furthermore, there was only one remaining battalion in South Vietnam\u2019s strategic reserve, and it may not be enough to drive the VC out from the area if it was committed. Westmoreland was unwilling to leave the VC with a position from which they could dominate Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Long Province. So, on June 13, he made the decision to insert U.S. combat forces. Subsequently, 738 men of the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 503rd Infantry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade, were flown out to the staging area in Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Vinh. Elements of the 3rd Battalion (Airborne), 319th Artillery also followed later in the day. Upon arrival at Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Vinh, the U.S. Army task force waited for five days, but it soon became apparent that the VC had withdrawn from the area and had no intention of holding territory.

But the jungle had other plans. \"We thought we were hunting the Viet Cong,\" recalled Sergeant James McDonough, a veteran of the battle. \"Turns out, the jungle was hunting *us*.\" The thick foliage swallowed radio signals, twisted paths into labyrinths, and turned every rustle into a potential ambush. By the time the brigade realized they were lost, the Viet Cong had already circled back\u2014like a predator closing in on wounded prey.\n\n---\n\n### **The Land That Fought Back**\nThe battle wasn\u2019t just about bullets; it was a clash of strategies. While U.S. troops relied on firepower and air support, the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong used the terrain like a weapon. They dug tunnels, set traps, and vanished into the undergrowth, striking when least expected. \"The land was their ally,\" said historian Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Th\u1eafng. \"Every tree, every stream\u2014it all worked against us.\" The Americans, accustomed to open warfare, found themselves fighting an enemy that refused to stand and fight.

It also marked the beginning of the end for the idea that technology alone could win wars. As the brigade limped out of the highlands, one thing was clear: in Vietnam, the real enemy wasn\u2019t just the other side\u2014it was the land itself.\n\n*The next time an army marches into the unknown, will it remember \u0110\u1ed3ng Xo\u00e0i\u2014or will it, too, be swallowed by the green?*"}

They can choose to use these materials literally, imitating their sounds, as when Sergei Prokofiev uses an oboe for the quacking of a duck in Peter and the Wolf; it may represent the birds symbolically; or it may give a general impression, as when Vivaldi paints a picture of birds moving and singing in The Four Seasons. Two especially popular birds are the nightingale and the cuckoo. The nightingale's song has been used by composers including Handel, who quoted it in the aria \"Sweet bird\" in L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato, in the \"Nightingale chorus\" in Solomon, and in his Organ Concerto \"No. 13\", known as \"The Cuckoo and the Nightingale\". It appears in Rameau's opera Hippolyte, Respighi's The Birds and Beethoven's Third Symphony. Nightingales can also be found in works by Glinka, Mendelssohn, Liszt, Balakirev, Grieg, Granados, Ravel, and Milhaud. The cuckoo's distinctive call is used in the 13th-century English \"Sumer is icumen in\", probably the earliest instance of a birdcall in musical notation. In 1650, Athanasius Kircher represented the calls of several birds in musical notation in his encyclopedic Musurgia Universalis. Heinrich Biber's c. 1669 Sonata Representiva is composed in sections labelled with the names of birds and other animals. It uses string scratching and detuned unisons to imitate the nightingale, cuckoo, cockerel and chicken. Several composers have written works that portray multiple birds. Cl\u00e9ment Janequin's 16th century Le Chant Des Oiseaux has the singers mention birds by name, and then depicts the bird's songs with nonsense syllables. Jean-Philippe Rameau's 1724 Rappel des Oiseaux indicates the presence of bird calls only in its title; while John Walsh's c. 1715 Bird Fancyer's Delight is a collection of short phrases labelled with bird names, which was intended to teach cagebirds to sing. Among the major composers to imitate birdsong are Beethoven (Pastoral Symphony, 2nd movement), Delius (On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring), Handel (The Cuckoo and the Nightingale), Respighi (The Birds), Rimsky-Korsakov (Snow Maidens), Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Saint-Saens (Carnival of the Animals), Vivaldi (Concerto in A, The Cuckoo), and Gustav Mahler (First Symphony, where the cuckoo sings perfect fourths instead of the usual major third or minor third).","h_score":1750339.5062500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":50271935,"revid":1169007708,"description":"Role of birdsong in Western music","categories":["Birds in popular culture","Field recording","Zoomusicology"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nImagine a symphony where the conductor is a robin.

They were equipped with light weapons, machine guns, and a small number of 3.7 cm Pak 35\/36 anti-tank guns. From the start, there was significant rivalries and little internal cohesion within the LVF; 400 men were lost to desertion and disease in its first months before even seeing action. There were frequent confrontations between supporters of Doriot and Deloncle, especially among the unit's highly politicised French officers. The historian Oleg Beyda writes:\n\n> The military training the soldiers had received was poor; little attention was paid to them, and the weapons they were given were of low quality. For the most part, the personnel were unsuited to military service. Food supplies were inadequate and of unsatisfactory quality. Because of an almost complete lack of facilities, hygiene was poor, and lice began to appear while the troops were still in the camp. Letters from home came irregularly, and the legionnaires learned soon after their arrival that their families were not receiving the whole sums stipulated in the contracts, which gave rise to general discontent.\n\nThe LVF was deployed to Smolensk and sent as reinforcements to the fighting near Moscow in November and December 1941 where it became the only foreign unit to fight alongside the Germans. Beyda writes that by the time of its arrival at the front, the unit \"was on its last legs\". Many collaborators had feared that the unit might arrive too late at the front to see action, and its training had been cut short for this reason. The LVF was first deployed in combat near the village of Vygliadovka and participated in a successful frontal assault against Soviet positions on 1 December, but was hit by a large Soviet counterattack several days later, suffering extremely high casualties. Within months, the LVF had lost around half its manpower in action or through frostbite; there was also a serious outbreak of dysentery. Some individual soldiers deserted to the Red Army or committed suicide. After two weeks, they were withdrawn from the front line in Djukovo (40 kilometres (25 mi) from Moscow) and returned to Smolensk. Afterwards, the LVF was used only behind the front-line.\n\n","h_score":1840212.4500000002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":12149701,"revid":1165555475,"description":"French collaborationist military unit during WWII","categories":["Anti-communist organizations","Collaboration with the Axis Powers","Foreign volunteer units of Nazi Germany","Foreign volunteer units of the Wehrmacht","France\u2013Soviet Union relations","Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism","Military units and formations disestablished in 1944","Military units and formations established in 1941","Military units and formations of France in World War II","Military units and formations of the Soviet\u2013German War"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Ghost Legion: How France\u2019s Forgotten Anti-Bolshevik Mercenaries Fought a War That Never Ended\"**\n\n*In the shadow of the First World War, a ragtag army of French volunteers\u2014ex-soldiers, adventurers, and even deserters\u2014marched east to crush the Red Menace.

Two solar panel arrays that were 4 m (13 ft) long each, with single axis articulation, generated power for the spacecraft. ERTS-A had a liftoff weight of 953 kilograms (2,101 lb).\n\nThe main spacecraft propulsion was three hydrazine thrusters. An attitude control system permitted the spacecraft's orientation to be maintained within plus or minus 0.7 degrees in all three axes.\n\nSpacecraft communications included a command subsystem operating at 154.2 and 2106.4 MHz and a PCM narrow-band telemetry subsystem, operating at 2287.5 and 137.86 MHz, for spacecraft housekeeping, attitude, and sensor performance data. Video data from the three-camera RBV system was transmitted in both real-time and tape recorder modes at 2265.5 MHz, while information from the MSS was constrained to a 20 MHz radio-frequency bandwidth at 2229.5 MHz.\n\nThe satellite also carried two wide-band video tape recorders (WBVTR) capable of storing up to 30 minutes of scanner or camera data, giving the spacecraft's sensors a near-global coverage capability.\n\nThe satellite was also equipped with a data collection system (DCS) to collect information from remote, individually equipped ground stations and to relay the data to central acquisition stations. Due to the orbit of the satellite, data could be obtained at a minimum of every 12 hours. No data processing or signal multiplexing occurred on the satellite. The design of the DCS came from the Nimbus-3 platform, then known as the interrogation, recording, and location system (IRLS).\n\n ### Sensors\n\nERTS-A had two sensors to achieve its primary objectives: the return beam vidicon (RBV) and the multispectral scanner (MSS).\n\nThe RBV was manufactured by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). The RBV obtained visible light and near infrared photographic images of Earth. At launch, the RBV was considered the primary sensor.\n\nThe MSS was designed by Virginia Norwood at Hughes Aircraft Company, which also manufactured it. Norwood is called \"The Mother of Landsat.\" The sensor was considered an experimental sensor, and was the secondary sensor, until scientists reviewed the data that was beamed back to Earth. After the data was reviewed, the MSS was considered the primary sensor. The MSS was a four-channel scanner that obtained radiometric images of Earth.\n\n ## Mission\n\n ### Launch\n\nERTS-A was launched July 23, 1972, on a Delta 0900 out of Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The spacecraft was placed in a sun-synchronous orbit, with an altitude between 907 and 915 km. The spacecraft was placed in an orbit with an inclination of 99 degrees which orbited the Earth every 103 minutes. It was the first satellite launched with the sole purpose of studying and monitoring the planet.\n\nUpon reaching orbit, it was renamed to ERTS-1. On January 14, 1975, eight days before ERTS-B was to launch, NASA announced that ERTS-1 was renamed Landsat 1 and ERTS-B would be Landsat 2 after launch.\n\n ### Operations\n\nLandsat 1's tape recorders malfunctioned in January 1978, and the satellite was taken out of service.\n\n ## Results\n\nFrom launch until 1974, Landsat 1 transmitted over 100,000 images, which covered more than 75% of the Earth's surface. The majority of these images were taken with the multispectral scanner. On 5 August 1972 the return beam vidicon failed after taking only 1690 images.\n\nIn 1976, Landsat 1 discovered a tiny uninhabited island 20 kilometers off the eastern coast of Canada. This island was thereafter designated Landsat Island after the satellite.\n\nThe MSS provided more than 300,000 images over the lifespan of the satellite. NASA oversaw 300 researchers that evaluated the data that Landsat 1 transmitted back to Earth.\n\nLandsat 1 images were used in the first study of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), now an ubiquitous measure of global plant greenness.","h_score":1796220.875,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":391246,"revid":1170231121,"description":"First satellite of the United States' Landsat program, active 1972\u201378","categories":["Landsat program","Spacecraft launched by Delta rockets","Spacecraft launched in 1972"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"1\/10\nMeet **Landsat 1**\u2014the world\u2019s first Earth-observing satellite designed for *continuous* monitoring.

Witnesses reported that after the bear's rear left leg began shaking, he became agitated before convulsing several times and falling backwards into the pool. Approximately 600 to 700 zoo visitors witnessed Knut's death. A statement made on 22 March in relation to the necropsy reported there were \"significant changes in the brain, which may be regarded as a reason for the sudden death\". Animal welfare organizations in Germany initially accused the Berlin Zoo of negligence, claiming that Knut died of stress caused by being forced to share his enclosure with three female polar bears. The zoo denied such claims. Bear curator Heiner Kl\u00f6s stated they \"did everything to look after Knut\u2014it's normal for polar bears to live with other polar bears in a zoo, and the idea was that Knut should learn social behavior and other skills from the older females ... He played with the other bears, he was relaxed and strong.\"\n\nOn 1 April, pathology experts announced that Knut's immediate cause of death was from drowning. The bear's apparent seizure was due to his suffering from encephalitis, a swelling of the brain likely triggered by an infection. It is unknown what infection caused the swelling, but pathologists believe it was a virus. Although Knut showed no symptoms of being ill, pathologists believe that \"this suspected infection must already have been there for a long time ... at least several weeks, possibly months.\"\n\nKnut's sudden death caused an international outpouring of grief. Hundreds of fans visited the zoo after the bear's death, leaving flowers and mementos near the enclosure. The mayor of Berlin, Klaus Wowereit, stated \"We all held him so dearly. He was the star of the Berlin zoos.\"\n\nIn January 2014, Knut's full autopsy results were published by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in the Journal of Comparative Pathology. It was the most in-depth post-mortem ever carried out on an animal. The autopsy revealed that the damage to the bear's brain was so severe that even if he had not fallen into the water and drowned he would have died anyway. Experts hypothesized that he was suffering from a virus that caused the encephalitis.\n\nIn August 2015, it was discovered that Knut died of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.\n\n ## Memorialization\n\nThe zoo made plans to erect a monument in Knut's honour, financed by donations from fans. Thomas Ziolko, the chairman of the Friends of the Berlin Zoo, was quoted as saying \"Knut will live on in the hearts of many visitors, but it's important to create a memorial for coming generations to preserve the memory of this unique animal personality.\" On 24 October 2012, the Berlin Zoo unveiled a bronze sculpture by Ukrainian artist Josef Tabachnyk. \"Knut \u2013 The Dreamer\" shows the bear \"stretching out dreamily on a rock\".\n\nKnut's remains were exhibited in Berlin's Museum of Natural History, although this decision has caused some controversy with fans. A full-sized sculpture covered in Knut's pelt was presented to the public on 16 February 2013. It went on display in the entrance hall of the museum where it was viewed free of charge until 5 May. It will later be used for an exhibition on climate change and environment protection. Museum spokeswoman Gesine Steiner stated that \"It's important to make clear we haven't had Knut stuffed. It is an artistically valuable sculpture with the original fur.\"\n\nFrom 13 June until 1 September 2013, Knut went on display in the Naturalis Biodiversity Center, the Dutch national museum of natural history in Leiden, Netherlands.\n\nKnut returned to Berlin's Museum of Natural History on 28 July 2014 as an exhibit for a special exhibition on \"Highlights of Taxidermy\". The museum has won world championship prizes for taxidermy and Knut's remains will be the highlight of this exhibition for years to come.\n\n ## Effects of popularity\n\n","h_score":1851009.8687500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":19541336,"revid":1154318178,"description":"Polar bear born in captivity at the Berlin Zoological Garden","categories":["2006 animal births","2011 animal deaths","Articles containing video clips","Berlin Zoological Garden","Celebrity animals","Deaths by drowning","Filmed deaths of animals","Individual animals in Germany","Individual polar bears","Male mammals"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nMeet Knut\u2014the polar bear who stole hearts (and headlines) in 2006.

Together they wrote Brieven uit en over Amerika (Letters from and about America), which was published in 1906. During their travels, Gerritsen became ill and died in 1905 from cancer. After recovering from a depression caused by her loss, Jacobs resumed her suffrage work in 1906, touring with Carrie Chapman Catt through the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Jacobs spearheaded the organization of the 1908 IWSA Congress, the first to be held in the Netherlands. It took place in June in Amsterdam bringing international delegates to the city, spurring growth of the Dutch suffrage movement. In 1910, she traveled to South Africa, invited by activists who called on her organizational services. She toured from Cape Town to Johannesburg making speeches on suffrage, as well as hygiene, sanitation, prostitution and venereal diseases, while calling for universal sex education. In 1911, after the IWSA conference in Stockholm, Jacobs and Catt embarked on a 16-month tour to evaluate women's legal and social positions and encourage women to struggle for pertinent improvements. The trip took them to \"South Africa, the Middle East, India, Ceylon, the Dutch East Indies, Burma, the Philippines, China and Japan\". Jacobs financed the trip by writing articles about their adventures for the newspaper De Telegraaf. In 1914, shortly after the start of World War I, Jacobs promoted holding the International Women's Congress in The Hague, given the country's neutrality. Intended as a forum for women from throughout the world to meet and discuss opposition to war, the meeting was chaired by the pacifist Jane Addams from Chicago. Coordinated by Jacobs, Mia Boissevain, and Rosa Manus, the conference, which opened on 28 April 1915, was attended by 1,136 participants from both neutral and non-belligerent nations, and resulted in the establishment of an organization which would become the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF). Jacobs became the vice-president of both the international organization and the Dutch chapter of WILPF. After the conference closed on 3 May 1915, Addams and Jacobs, along with Chrystal Macmillan, Rosika Schwimmer and Mien van Wulfften Palthe-Broese van Groenou and others, formed two delegations of women who were dispatched to meet European heads of state over the next several months. The women secured agreement from reluctant Foreign Ministers, who overall felt that such a body would be ineffective. Nevertheless, they agreed to participate, or not impede creation of a neutral mediating body, if other nations agreed and if US President Woodrow Wilson would initiate a body. In the midst of the war, Wilson refused. In 1917 Dutch women obtained the right to stand in elections, though they could not vote. Jacobs stood as a candidate for the Vrijzinnig Democratische Bond in the election of 1918 and though she received more votes than any other woman candidate, she was not elected. Along with MP Henri Marchant, in 1918 Jacobs founded the journal, De opbouw, Democratisch Tijdschrift (The building, Democratic Magazine) in which she wrote several articles between 1918 and 1924. Marchant introduced a women's suffrage bill which was adopted in 1919, and signed by Queen Wilhelmina on 18 September 1919. Shortly thereafter, Jacobs resigned from the presidency of the Vereeniging voor Vrouwenkiesrecht. ## Later life (1919\u20131924)\n\nJacobs left Amsterdam and moved to The Hague after the suffrage fight was won in 1919. Thanks to the international reputation she had gained from the suffrage movement, Jacobs' role as a pioneer of contraception was drawn on by birth control activists in the United States, such as Margaret Sanger. Between 1922 and 1923, Jacobs served on the advisory board of the Voluntary Parenthood League, established by Mary Dennett. The following year, she was the guest of honor at the VPL's annual conference held in New York City.\n\nHaving lost most of her money in poor investments, Jacobs was supported by her friend Mien van Wulfften Palthe-Broese van Groenou. Between 1923 and 1924, she worked on her autobiography, at her home on Van Aerssenstraat 46, refusing offers from family friends to reside with them, so that she could spread out her clippings and journals in her own home. After completing her autobiography she lived with the Broese van Groenou family. She continued to attend the conferences of the International Council of Women, International Alliance of Women and WILPF until her death.\n\n","h_score":1842539.9187500002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":3853360,"revid":1171904968,"description":"Dutch physician and feminist (1854\u20131929)","categories":["1854 births","1929 deaths","19th-century Dutch physicians","19th-century Dutch women","19th-century women physicians","20th-century Dutch physicians","20th-century Dutch women","20th-century women physicians","Dutch Jews","Dutch feminists","Dutch pacifists","Dutch suffragists","Dutch women physicians","Free-thinking Democratic League politicians","Jewish feminists","Jewish pacifists","Jewish physicians","Jewish suffragists","Obstetricians","Pacifist feminists","People from Hoogezand-Sappemeer","University of Groningen alumni","Women's International League for Peace and Freedom people"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Aletta Jacobs: The Dutch Pioneer Who Broke Barriers for Women in Medicine**\n\n*Aletta Jacobs became the first female doctor in the Netherlands in 1878, defying societal norms and paving the way for women\u2019s education and professional equality.

She also co-founded the *International Council of Women* in 1888, linking feminist movements across continents.\n\nHer methods were pragmatic: *\"If we wait for permission, we\u2019ll wait forever,\"* she told a gathering of female doctors in 1908.

The murder turns Kara\u0111or\u0111e into a fugitive. Following an unsuccessful rebellion against the Ottomans, Kara\u0111or\u0111e is forced to flee Serbia and seek refuge in the Austrian Empire, across the Sava River. When Kara\u0111or\u0111e's father refuses to accompany his son out of the country, Kara\u0111or\u0111e kills him. After spending a period of time in Austria, Kara\u0111or\u0111e returns to Serbia. In February 1804, following the Slaughter of the Knezes, surviving Serbian notables gather at the Ora\u0161ac Assembly and decide to rebel against the Dahije, the renegade Janissaries who precipitated the massacre. The notables propose that Kara\u0111or\u0111e lead the insurrection, given his prior military experience. He initially declines their offer, but ultimately relents; the First Serbian Uprising begins. The Dahije soon foresee their downfall, witnessing their fates reflected in a bowl of water drawn from the Danube.\n\nKara\u0111or\u0111e defeats the Dahije, but ends up turning on the Sultan, who had earlier offered to support Kara\u0111or\u0111e in his struggle against the rogue Janissaries.

The uprising continues for nearly a decade but is ultimately defeated and Kara\u0111or\u0111e is forced to flee to Austria once again. In 1817, he decides to return to Serbia to lead a new rebellion. Kara\u0111or\u0111e's chief rival, Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107, is made aware of this development.

The longest rivers in Croatia are the 562-kilometre (349 mi) Sava, 505-kilometre (314 mi) Drava, 296-kilometre (184 mi) Kupa and a 188-kilometre (117 mi) section of the Danube. The longest rivers emptying into the Adriatic Sea are the 101-kilometre (63 mi) Cetina and an only 20-kilometre (12 mi) section of the Neretva.\n\nThe largest lakes in Croatia are 30.7-square-kilometre (11.9 sq mi) Lake Vrana located in the northern Dalmatia, 17.1-square-kilometre (6.6 sq mi) Lake Dubrava near Vara\u017edin, 13.0-square-kilometre (5.0 sq mi) Peru\u0107a Lake (reservoir) on the Cetina River, 11.1-square-kilometre (4.3 sq mi) Lake Prokljan near Skradin and 10.1-square-kilometre (3.9 sq mi) Lake Vara\u017edin reservoir through which the Drava River flows near Vara\u017edin. Croatia's most famous lakes are the Plitvice lakes, a system of 16 lakes with waterfalls connecting them over dolomite and limestone cascades. The lakes are renowned for their distinctive colours, ranging from turquoise to mint green, grey or blue. Croatia has a remarkable wealth in terms of wetlands. Four of those are included in the Ramsar list of internationally important wetlands: Lonjsko Polje along the Sava and Lonja rivers near Sisak, Kopa\u010dki Rit at the confluence of the Drava and Danube, the Neretva Delta and Crna Mlaka near Jastrebarsko.\n\nAverage annual precipitation and evaporation rates are 1,162 millimetres (45.7 in) and 700 millimetres (28 in), respectively.

He went on graduate from the Harvard Divinity School and the next year married Sophia Dana. Shortly after, he became ordained as the minister of the Purchase Street Church in Boston, Massachusetts, where he began to question traditional Unitarian beliefs. He became one of the founding members of the Transcendental Club and hosted its first official meeting in his home. Shortly after, he resigned from the church to put Transcendental beliefs in practice by founding an experimental commune called Brook Farm. The community later converted to a model based on the work of Charles Fourier, although the community was never financially stable in either format.\n\nAfter Brook Farm's failure, Ripley was hired by Horace Greeley at the New York Tribune. He also published the New American Cyclopaedia, which made him financially successful.

The Transcendentalist\u2019s Mad Scientist Phase**\nGeorge Ripley wasn\u2019t just a thinker\u2014he was a *doer*, a rare breed in the 1840s. While Emerson and Thoreau waxed poetic about nature\u2019s divine spark, Ripley rolled up his sleeves and founded **Brook Farm**, a utopian commune where 200 idealists (including Nathaniel Hawthorne) tried to live by the rule: *\"Let us not be understood as advocating a wild, indiscriminate socializing.\"* Oops. The experiment collapsed in flames (literally\u2014fire destroyed the farm in 1846), but Ripley\u2019s legacy? A blueprint for the \"fail forward\" ethos of modern co-living.\n\n*\"Brook Farm was less a failure than a crucible,\"* says historian **Sarah Rotman**, *\"where the tension between theory and practice became its own kind of revelation.\"*\n\n---\n\n### **2. From Commune to *The Dial*: Publishing the Unpublishable**\nWhen Brook Farm burned, Ripley pivoted\u2014like a philosopher-journalist MacGyver. He co-founded *The Dial*, the transcendentalists\u2019 in-house zine, where he published Emerson, Fuller, and Margaret Fuller\u2019s *Woman in the Nineteenth Century* (a manifesto so radical it made Victorian readers clutch their pearls). Ripley\u2019s editorial motto? *\"Truth is the only currency that doesn\u2019t devalue.\"* The magazine folded after four years, but its influence? A direct line to today\u2019s indie presses and Substack rebels.\n\n*\"Ripley didn\u2019t just edit *The Dial*\u2014he *weaponized* it,\"* quips literary scholar **Mark C. Taylor**. *\"He turned marginal ideas into a movement, one poorly paid issue at a time.\"*\n\n---\n\n### **3. The Ripley Effect: Why His Obscurity Is a Scam**\nSo why isn\u2019t Ripley a household name? Blame the 19th-century PR grind.

As a top aide of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Chairman Yasser Arafat, al-Wazir had considerable influence in Fatah's military activities, eventually becoming the commander of Fatah's armed wing al-Assifa.\n\nAl-Wazir became a refugee when his family was expelled from Ramla during the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, and began leading a minor fedayeen force in the Gaza Strip. In the early 1960s he established connections for Fatah with Communist regimes and prominent third-world leaders. He opened Fatah's first bureau in Algeria. He played an important role in the 1970\u201371 Black September clashes in Jordan, by supplying besieged Palestinian fighters with weapons and aid. Following the PLO's defeat by the Jordanian Army, al-Wazir joined the PLO in Lebanon.\n\nPrior to and during Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, al-Wazir planned numerous attacks inside Israel against both civilian and military targets. He prepared Beirut's defense against incoming Israeli forces. Nonetheless, the Israeli military prevailed and al-Wazir was exiled from Lebanon with the rest of the Fatah leadership. He settled in Amman for a two-year period and was then exiled to Tunis in 1986. From his base there, he started to organize youth committees in the Palestinian territories; these eventually formed a major component of the Palestinian forces in the First Intifada. However, he did not live to command the uprising. On 16 April 1988, he was assassinated at his home in Tunis by Israeli commandos.\n\n ## Early life\n\nKhalil al-Wazir was born in 1935 to Muslim parents in the city of Ramla, Palestine, then under British Mandatory rule. His father, Ibrahim al-Wazir, worked as a grocer in the city. Al-Wazir and his family were expelled in July 1948, along with another 50,000\u201370,000 Palestinians from Lydda and Ramla, following Israel's capture of the area during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. They settled in the Bureij refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, where al-Wazir attended a secondary school run by UNRWA. While in high school, he began organizing a small group of fedayeen to harass Israelis at military posts near the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula.\n\nIn 1954 he came into contact with Yasser Arafat in Gaza; al-Wazir would become Arafat's right-hand man later in his life. During his time in Gaza, al-Wazir became a member of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, and was briefly imprisoned for his membership with the organization, as it was prohibited in Egypt. In 1956, a few months after his release from prison, he received military training in Cairo. He also studied architectural engineering at the University of Alexandria, but he did not graduate. Al-Wazir was detained once again in 1957 for leading raids against Israel and was exiled to Saudi Arabia, finding work as a schoolteacher. He continued to teach after moving to Kuwait in 1959.\n\n ## Formation of Fatah\n\nAl-Wazir used his time in Kuwait to further his ties with Arafat and other fellow Palestinian exiles he had met in Egypt. He and his comrades founded Fatah, a Palestinian nationalist guerrilla and political organization, sometime between 1959 and 1960. He moved to Beirut after being put in charge of editing the newly formed organization's monthly magazine Filastinuna, Nida' al-Hayat (\"Our Palestine, the Call to Life\"), as he was \"the only one with a flair for writing.\"\n\nHe settled in Algeria in 1962, after a delegation of Fatah leaders, including Arafat and Farouk Kaddoumi, were invited there by Algerian President Ahmed Ben Bella. Al-Wazir remained there, opened a Fatah office and military training camp in Algiers and was included in an Algerian-Fatah delegation to Beijing in 1964. During his visit, he presented Fatah's ideas to various leaders of the People's Republic of China, including premier Zhou Enlai, and thus inaugurated Fatah's good relationship with China. He also toured other East Asian countries, establishing relations with North Korea and the Viet Cong. Al-Wazir supposedly \"charmed Che Guevara\" during Guevara's speech in Algiers. With his guerrilla credentials and his contacts with arms-supplying nations, he was assigned the role of recruiting and training fighters, thus establishing Fatah's armed wing al-Assifa (the Storm). While in Algiers, he recruited Abu Ali Iyad who became his deputy and one of the high-ranking commanders of al-Assifa in Syria and Jordan.\n\n","h_score":1801007.46875,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1008879,"revid":1166048427,"description":"Palestinian military leader, founder of Fatah (1935\u20131988)","categories":["1935 births","1980s assassinated politicians","1988 deaths","Assassinated Palestinian politicians","Assassinations in Tunisia","Fatah members","Fatah military commanders","Mandatory Palestine people","Members of the Palestinian Central Council","Palestinian Muslims","Palestinian people imprisoned by Syria","Palestinian refugees","People from Ramla","People killed in Mossad operations","People murdered in Tunisia","Targeted killings by the Israel Defense Forces"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nMeet Khalil al-Wazir: the man who turned a *keyboard* into a weapon.

On 20 February 1949, the whole LTS line was transferred to the Eastern Region, yet despite the organisational changes, the old LTSR still was a distinctive system operated by former LTS and LMS locomotives until electrification.\n\nBritish Railways electrified the former LTSR line in 1959. Electric services began on 6 November 1961 and a full electric timetable was introduced on 18 June the following year. In the 1980s, the station roof was dismantled and high-rise office blocks were built above the station leaving the 1854 facade intact.\n\nFenchurch Street station suffered a negative reputation under public ownership. By the end of the 1980s, the former LTSR line was carrying over 50,000 passengers a day on a 50-year old infrastructure. The persistent overcrowding and uncleanliness on trains led to it being dubbed \"the misery line\". In 1989 Sir Robert Reid called the service from Fenchurch Street \"wholly unacceptable\", while Teresa Gorman, Member of Parliament for Billericay, subsequently called it \"one of the disgraces of our public railway service for many years\". Between 1982 and 1992, the station was operated by Network SouthEast, one of British Rail's three passenger business sectors, before being handed over to a business unit in preparation for privatisation.\n\nIn July 1994, shortly before rail privatisation, the station closed for seven weeks for an \u00a383 million project to replace signals, track and electrification works. It was the first significant closure of a London terminal station, albeit planned and temporary.\n\nThe development of Lakeside Shopping Centre, near Chafford Hundred and Thurrock, increased demand for services from the station. In 2013, Network Rail announced a \u00a33.4m upgrade creating a third exit on Cooper's Row to make connections with Tower Hill easier.\n\nIn 2019, a planning application was submitted to the City of London (planning authority) for permission to revamp the station building.\n\n ### Underground\n\nIn the 1970s, Fenchurch Street was considered to be an integral part of the proposed Fleet line (now called the Jubilee line), which would have given the station an Underground connection. An extension from the end of the track terminus at Charing Cross to Fenchurch Street via Aldwych and Ludgate Circus would have seen the line cross the River Thames and continue southeastwards towards Surrey Docks and Lewisham. A revised route, approved in 1980, would have seen the line follow a more northerly route to Woolwich Arsenal and Beckton.\n\nMott, Hay and Anderson and Sir William Halcrow and Partners began constructing the line to Charing Cross, but did not finish the project until 1979. Rising costs and high inflation led to London Transport abandoning the eastwards extension via Fenchurch Street in 1981. The line was completed in 1999, using a different route via the Greenwich Peninsula to Stratford, crossing the LTSR line from Fenchurch Street at West Ham. This has altered demand for Fenchurch Street, with passengers from Essex changing there instead.\n\n ## Services\n\nServices from Fenchurch Street run towards East London and south Essex, including Barking, Upminster, Chafford Hundred Lakeside (for Lakeside Shopping Centre), Tilbury Town (for the Gravesend\u2013Tilbury Ferry and cruise services) Basildon, Southend Central and Shoeburyness. The typical off-peak service consists of eight trains per hour (tph):\n\nDuring peak periods services are increased up to 20 trains per hour. Most peak services have 12 cars.\n\nAlthough the station's capacity is small compared to other London terminals, it has a high footfall, averaging around 16 million passengers annually. A report in 2001 showed approximately 3,000 people commuted daily from Castle Point to the city via Fenchurch Street, while a 2013 report said it was the busiest station on the LTSR route, with 46,000 daily peak-time passengers.\n\n ## Future\n\nThere have been proposals to move the station 380 yards to the east to allow the station to expand to 6 platforms, (up from the current 4) and would be built partly on the site of Tower Gateway DLR station, which would likely be permanently closed.\n\nThe new station could be built with direct interchange with Tower Hill tube station, which could also have a replacement DLR station for Tower Gateway as Transport for London have looked into closing Tower Gateway and constructing a replacement on the Bank branch to increase capacity.\n\n","h_score":1782172.3687500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":361302,"revid":1173760030,"description":"Railway terminus in the City of London","categories":["1841 establishments in England","Former London and Blackwall Railway stations","London station group","Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1841","Railway stations in the City of London","Railway stations served by c2c","Railway termini in London","William Tite railway stations"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"1\/10\nFenchurch Street Station is London\u2019s oldest railway terminus, opening in 1841.

While his family remained in Arlington, he spent most of his time either in Bennington or on the road, where he could avoid his wife's nagging. Shortly after his arrival, Vermont's Assembly passed the Banishment Act, a sweeping measure allowing for the confiscation and auction by the republic of property owned by known Tories. Allen was appointed to be one of the judges responsible for deciding whose property was subject to seizure under the law. (This law was so successful at collecting revenue that Vermont did not impose any taxes until 1781.) Allen personally escorted some of those convicted under the law to Albany, where he turned them over to General John Stark for transportation to the British lines. Some of these supposed Tories protested to New York Governor George Clinton that they were actually dispossessed Yorkers. Clinton, who considered Vermont to still be a part of New York, did not want to honor the actions of the Vermont tribunals; Stark, who had custody of the men, disagreed with Clinton. Eventually the dispute made its way to George Washington, who essentially agreed with Stark since he desperately needed the general's services. The prisoners were eventually transported to West Point, where they remained in \"easy imprisonment\". While Allen's service as a judge in Vermont was brief, he continued to ferret out Tories and report them to local Boards of Confiscation for action. He was so zealous in these efforts that they also included naming his own brother Levi, who was apparently trying to swindle Allen and Ira out of land at the time. This action was somewhat surprising, as Levi had not only attempted to purchase Allen's release while he was in Halifax, but he had also traveled to New York while Allen was on parole there and furnished him with goods and money. Allen and Levi engaged in a war of words, many of which were printed in the Connecticut Courant, even after Levi crossed British lines. They would eventually reconcile in 1783. Early in 1779, Governor Clinton issued a proclamation stating that the state of New York would honor the Wentworth grants, if the settlers would recognize New York's political jurisdiction over the Vermont territory. Allen wrote another pamphlet in response, entitled An Animadversory [sic] Address to the Inhabitants of the State of Vermont; with Remarks on a Proclamation under the Hand of his Excellency George Clinton, Esq; Governor of the State of New York. In typical style, Allen castigated the governor for issuing \"romantic proclamations ... calculated to deceive woods people\", and for his \"folly and stupidity\". Clinton's response, once he recovered his temper, was to issue another proclamation little different from the first. Allen's pamphlet circulated widely, including among members of Congress, and was successful in casting the Vermonters' case in a positive light. In a dispatch to Clinton from Westminster, two prisoners from New York sentenced after Allen\u2019s intervention pleaded with the governor to free them from being at \u201cthe disposal of Ethan Allin [sic] which is more to be dreaded than Death with all its Terrors.\u201d In 1779, Allen published the account of his time in captivity, A Narrative of Colonel Ethan Allen's Captivity ... Containing His Voyages and Travels, With the most remarkable Occurrences respecting him and many other Continental Prisoners of Observations. Written by Himself and now published for the Information of the Curious in all Nations. First published as a serial by the Pennsylvania Packet, the book was an instant best-seller; it is still available today. While largely accurate, it notably omits Benedict Arnold from the capture of Ticonderoga, and Seth Warner as the leader of the Green Mountain Boys. ### Negotiations with the British\n\nAllen appeared before the Continental Congress as early as September 1778 on behalf of Vermont, seeking recognition as an independent state. He reported that due to Vermont's expansion to include border towns from New Hampshire, Congress was reluctant to grant independent statehood to Vermont. Between 1780 and 1783, Allen participated, along with his brother Ira, Vermont Governor Thomas Chittenden, and others, in negotiations with Frederick Haldimand, the governor of Quebec, that were ostensibly about prisoner exchanges, but were really about establishing Vermont as a new British province and gaining military protection for its residents. The negotiations, once details of them were published, were often described by opponents of Vermont statehood as treasonous, but no such formal charges were ever laid against anyone involved.\n\n ## Later years\n\nAs the war had ended with the 1783 Treaty of Paris, and the United States, operating under the Articles of Confederation, resisted any significant action with respect to Vermont, Allen's historic role as an agitator became less important, and his public role in Vermont's affairs declined. Vermont's government had also become more than a clique dominated by the Allen and Chittenden families due to the territory's rapid population growth.\n\nIn 1782, Allen's brother Heber died at the relatively young age of 38. Allen's wife Mary died in June 1783 of consumption, to be followed several months later by their first-born daughter Loraine. While they had not always been close, and Allen's marriage had often been strained, Allen felt these losses deeply. A poem he wrote memorializing Mary was published in the Bennington Gazette.\n\n ### Publication of Reason\n\nIn these years, Allen recovered from Thomas Young's widow, who was living in Albany, the manuscript that he and Young had worked on in his youth and began to develop it into the work that was published in 1785 as Reason: the Only Oracle of Man. The work was a typical Allen polemic, but its target was religious, not political. Specifically targeted against Christianity, it was an unbridled attack against the Bible, established churches, and the powers of the priesthood. As a replacement for organized religion, he espoused a mixture of deism, Spinoza's naturalist views, and precursors of Transcendentalism, with man acting as a free agent within the natural world. While historians disagree over the exact authorship of the work, the writing contains clear indications of Allen's style.\n\nThe book was a complete financial and critical failure. Allen's publisher had forced him to pay the publication costs up front, and only 200 of the 1,500 volumes printed were sold. (The rest were eventually destroyed by a fire at the publisher's house.) The theologically conservative future president of Yale, Timothy Dwight, opined that \"the style was crude and vulgar, and the sentiments were coarser than the style. The arguments were flimsy and unmeaning, and the conclusions were fastened upon the premises by mere force.\" Allen took the financial loss and the criticism in stride, observing that most of the critics were clergymen, whose livelihood he was attacking.\n\n","h_score":1817748.2437500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":9333,"revid":1155795784,"description":"Farmer and founder of Vermont (1738\u20131789)","categories":["1738 births","1789 deaths","18th-century Christian universalists","American Revolutionary War prisoners of war held by Great Britain","American deists","American people of English descent","American spies during the American Revolution","British deists","Burials in Vermont","Continental Army officers from Connecticut","Ethan Allen","Lay theologians","Members of the Universalist Church of America","Military history of Vermont","Militia generals in the American Revolution","People of Vermont in the American Revolution","People of colonial Connecticut","People of pre-statehood Vermont","Politicians from Litchfield, Connecticut","Vermont militiamen in the American Revolution"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Ethan Allen: The Revolutionary Who Built a Furniture Empire (and a Legend)\"**\n\n*From Vermont militiaman to furniture mogul, Ethan Allen\u2019s defiant spirit shaped a brand\u2014and a nation.*\n\n---\n\n**A Patriot\u2019s Fight: From Battlefield to Boardroom**\nEthan Allen wasn\u2019t just a furniture salesman\u2014he was a firebrand.

It is a task of the Eurosystem to ensure an efficient and smooth supply of euro notes and to maintain their integrity throughout the euro area.\n\nIn December 2022, there were 4,805,243,241 \u20ac20 banknotes in circulation around the Eurozone. for \u20ac96,104,864,820.\n\nThis is a net number, i.e. the number of banknotes issued by the Eurosystem central banks, without further distinction as to who is holding the currency issued, thus also including the stocks held by credit institutions.\n\nBesides the date of the introduction of the first set to January 2002, the publication of figures is more significant through the maximum number of banknotes raised each year. The number is higher the end of the year.\n\nThe figures are as follows (3 Nov 2017) :\n\nIn November 2015, a new 'Europe' series was issued.\n\nThe first series of notes were issued in conjunction with those for a few weeks in the series 'Europe' until existing stocks are exhausted, then gradually withdrawn from circulation. Both series thus run parallel but the proportion tends inevitably to a sharp decrease in the first series.\n\nThe latest figures provided by the ECB are the following :\n\n ## Legal information\n\nLegally, both the European Central Bank and the central banks of the eurozone countries have the right to issue the seven different euro banknotes. In practice, only the national central banks of the zone physically issue and withdraw euro banknotes. The European Central Bank does not have a cash office and is not involved in any cash operations.\n\n ## Tracking\n\nThere are several communities of people at European level, most of which is EuroBillTracker, that, as a hobby, it keeps track of the euro banknotes that pass through their hands, to keep track and know where they travel or have travelled. The aim is to record as many notes as possible to know details about its spread, like from where and to where they travel in general, follow it up, like where a ticket has been seen in particular, and generate statistics and rankings, for example, in which countries there are more tickets.

Although the kingdom had existed since the early 16th century, it expanded its control beyond its traditional borders in the 1820s under King Radama I, who the British government officially recognized as the sovereign over the entire island of Madagascar. After several failed attempts to impose its authority over the island, France used military force to capture the royal palace in September 1894 and exiled Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony upon officially colonizing the island in February 1895. Queen Ranavalona III was allowed to remain as a figurehead until the emergence of a popular uprising, termed the Menalamba rebellion, for which the queen was held responsible. The rebellion was harshly crushed and the queen was exiled in 1897. The Menalamba rebellion was only the first manifestation of ongoing opposition to French rule that occasionally erupted in violent clashes between the Malagasy and the colonial authorities in Madagascar. Secret nationalist societies began to form in the 1910s. Conscription of Malagasy soldiers to fight for France in World War I strengthened resentment of foreign rule, and in the interwar period these nationalist organizations proliferated. Germany's defeat of the French army and occupation of France in 1940, the imposition of a Vichy regime on Madagascar and the subsequent capture of the island by the British in 1942 further tarnished the colonial government's image. Popular anger was especially aroused by its policies of forced labor in lieu of taxes, involuntary conscription into the army to fight in World War II, and the required contribution of large quantities of rice per head annually. Malagasy hopes for greater sovereignty were stirred by remarks given by General Charles de Gaulle at the Brazzaville Conference in 1944, where de Gaulle announced all colonies were thereafter French overseas territories entitled to representation in the French National Assembly, and promised citizenship rights to residents of its overseas colonies. Despite the partial implementation of these reforms, forced labor on French-owned plantations and other rights abuses in Madagascar continued unabated. The nationalist secret society Panama (Patriotes nationalistes malgaches) was founded in 1941, followed in 1943 by another called Jiny after a type of local red bird. Both organizations, which sought to achieve independence by force if necessary, saw their membership swell during this period. Following the end of the Second World War, several key Malagasy nationalist leaders attempted to achieve independence for Madagascar through legal means. At the first post-war constituent assembly convened in Paris in November 1945 to draft the constitution of the French Fourth Republic, Madagascar was represented by two doctors named Joseph Raseta and Joseph Ravoahangy. Together with future writer Jacques Rabemananjara, in early 1946 they formed the Mouvement d\u00e9mocratique de la r\u00e9novation malgache (MDRM) political party, whose platform was built on national independence from France. All three leaders were the descendants of Hova who had been politically prominent in the former Merina royal court.","h_score":1845966.2250000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1596338,"revid":1152911861,"description":"1947\u201349 anti-French revolt in Madagascar","categories":["1947 in France","1948 in France","1949 in France","20th-century rebellions","African resistance to colonialism","Conflicts in 1947","Conflicts in 1948","Conflicts in 1949","French Fourth Republic","French Madagascar","History of Madagascar","Malagasy nationalism","Mass murder in 1947","Mass murder in 1948","National liberation movements","Paramilitary organisations based in Madagascar","Rebellions in Africa","Resistance to the French colonial empire"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Madagascar\u2019s Fire: How a Grassroots Uprising Shook the Nation\"**\n\n*Protests erupt across Madagascar as citizens demand justice after a disputed election\u2014sparking a movement that could reshape the island\u2019s fragile democracy.*\n\n---\n\n### **A Spark in the Dark**\nThe unrest began in late July when opposition leader Marc Ravalomanana\u2014son of former president Marc Ravalomanana\u2014challenged President Andry Rajoelina\u2019s victory in a tightly contested election.

In May 1996, the seven filed a \\$35 million lawsuit against Harry Thomason and Darnell Martens, alleging unlawful interference with their employment and emotional distress. On June 5, 1996, Clinger announced that the committee's investigations had discovered that the White House had requested access to Billy Dale's FBI background check report seven months after the terminations, in what Clinger said was an improper effort to justify the firings. It was rapidly discovered that the White House had additionally gotten improper access to hundreds of other FBI background reports, many on former White House employees in Republican administrations; thus was born the Filegate controversy. The Senator Al D'Amato-chaired Senate Special Whitewater Committee, which had begun the previous year, issued its findings in a majority report on June 18, 1996; it did not investigate Travelgate directly, but did say that \"[Hillary] Clinton, upon learning of [Vince] Foster's death, at least realized its connection to [the] Travelgate scandal, and perhaps to the Whitewater matter, and dispatched her trusted lieutenants to contain any potential embarrassment or political damage.\" Minority Democratic members of the Committee derided these findings as \"a legislative travesty,\" \"a witch hunt,\" and \"a political game.\" The House Government Reform and Oversight Committee issued its majority report on September 18, 1996, in which it accused the Clinton administration of having obstructed the committee's efforts to investigate the Travelgate scandal. It portrayed Bill Clinton as being heavily involved in the travel office affair, more than any other investigation. The report's chapter titles were lurid: \"The White House Stonewalled All Investigations into the White House Travel Office Firings and Related Matters\", \"The White House Initiated a Full-Scale Campaign of Misinformation in the Aftermath of the Travel Office Firings and President Clinton Led the Misinformation Campaign from the First Days of the Travelgate Debacle\", \"Foster's Death Shattered a White House Just Recovering from an Abysmal First 6 Months of Administration\", and so forth. Democratic members of the Committee walked out in protest over the report, with ranking member Henry Waxman calling it \"an embarrassment to you [Chairman Clinger], this committee and this Congress\" and \"a crassly partisan smear campaign against President Clinton, Mrs. Clinton and this administration.\" The following month Clinger forwarded the report, along with one on Filegate, to the Independent Counsel, suggesting that the testimony of several witnesses be looked at for possible perjury or obstruction of justice. Democrats said this was politically motivated in an attempt to influence the 1996 presidential election.","h_score":1804583.1500000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1306667,"revid":1159263793,"description":"Ethics controversy of the Clinton administration","categories":["1993 controversies in the United States","1993 in American politics","Clinton administration controversies","Hillary Clinton controversies","Presidential scandals in the United States"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\n\ud83d\udea8 *The White House travel office scandal* wasn\u2019t just a paperwork mix-up\u2014it was a political earthquake.

Being located opposite Napoleon's residence at Palazzo Parisio, the auberge was converted into the French military command. After Malta fell under British rule in 1800, it was used by both the military and civil administrations. In 1888 the ground floor was used to store the notary archives and the upper floor was occupied by the Department of Work. It was converted into a Civil Arsenal. Plans to set a Protestant chapel was declined. At this point the ground floor also served as the Government Printing Office, while the upper floor was also used by the Royal Engineers. It later served as the Corps Headquarters and an officers' mess until the 1920s. In the early 19th century, chemist John Davy, who was in Malta with the Army Medical Staff, established a public dispensary at the auberge for the treatment of the poor and became known as the Albergo dei poveri (Auberge of the poor). The successor of this service, the Government Polyclinics, is still referred to as il-Ber\u0121a (the auberge).\n\nIn 1922, the National Museum was transferred from Palazzo Xara to Auberge d'Italie. The museum was directed by Sir Themistocles Zammit, and it was divided into archaeology, history, arts, natural history and mineralogical sections. The museum closed down during World War II, and the building received two direct hits on 7 April 1942. Part of the fa\u00e7ade was destroyed by aerial bombardment, and the natural history collection suffered severe damage since it was located in the part of the building which was hit. Documents from the Notarial Archives were stored in the auberge's basement during the war, and some were damaged while they were there. After the war ended, the damaged parts of the auberge were reconstructed, the museum was reopened and part of the building housed a school of art.\n\nThe Museums Department had to vacate Auberge d'Italie in 1954, when the building was converted into a temporary courthouse after the Courts of Justice had to vacate the war-damaged Auberge d'Auvergne due to its dilapidated state.

The Baltic peoples had created significant domains by the 1st century, and came into conflict with the Scandinavians and the Slavs; the Teutonic Order began targeting Lithuanian lands at the beginning of the 13th century. Since Lithuania was heavily wooded and its lands were often impassable, its interior was most approachable along its rivers when frozen and during the short dry harvest season in late summer. In response to this vulnerability, defensive structures, including a brick castle in Kaunas, were in place at various points on the Nemunas River by the 14th century. The city was first mentioned in written sources in 1361; it received Magdeburg rights, regulating its autonomy and establishing trade protocols, from Vytautas the Great in 1408. An outpost of the Hanseatic League was created there in 1441. By the end of the 16th century Kaunas had become a major regional trade center, but plagues, fires, and wars adversely affected the country and city during the 17th and 18th centuries. Following the partitions of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth at the end of the 18th century, Lithuania was incorporated into the Russian Empire. Two major 19th century projects contributed to the city's revival. The August\u00f3w Canal, completed in 1832, linked the Neman to the Black Sea, and a rail line linking Saint Petersburg, Warsaw, and Germany via Kaunas was completed in 1862; it was part of a limited network of western Russian railways.\n\nRussia's western borders needed support, and fortresses existed or were being built in Latvia, Ukraine, and Belarus. The concept of building a fortress in Lithuania was discussed without result in 1796, but became a critical concern after the French invasion of Russia in 1812 led by Napoleon. The Grande Arm\u00e9e managed to cross the Nemunas near Kaunas on its drive towards Moscow without major difficulties. An increasingly unified Germany troubled the Empire during the second half of the century. A fortress in Kaunas would present an obstacle to attacks from the west, preventing further incursions towards Riga and Vilnius. In order to control the region, attackers would need to first neutralize Kaunas. Facing this possibility and evaluating the natural advantages of the city, Russian officials decided to construct a fortress there. After several delays, on July 7, 1879 Tsar Alexander II issued an edict ordering its construction.\n\n","h_score":1785076.14375,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":17541559,"revid":1160720731,"description":"Fortress complex in Kaunas, Lithuania","categories":["19th-century fortifications","Buildings and structures completed in 1915","Buildings and structures in Kaunas","Castles in Lithuania","Forts in Lithuania","History of Kaunas","Holocaust locations in Lithuania","Objects listed in Lithuanian Registry of Cultural Property","Ruins in Lithuania","Soviet Union fortresses"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Kaunas Fortress: A Hidden Gem of Lithuania\u2019s Dark and Defiant History**\n\n*Built by the Soviet Union in the 1930s to suppress political dissent, Kaunas Fortress today stands as a memorial to victims of oppression\u2014and a stark reminder of Lithuania\u2019s fight for independence.*\n\n---\n\n### **A Prison for the Persecuted**\nKaunas Fortress was constructed between 1938 and 1941 under Soviet occupation, designed to imprison and execute political prisoners, including Lithuanian activists, Poles, and Jews.

The Michigan State Legislature named the South Beltline around the same time for the Congressman Paul B. Henry, who died in office in 1993, serving in Gerald Ford's old US House seat. The cost of the construction of new roads like the South Beltline was a campaign issue when Engler ran for re-election against Geoffrey Fieger in 1998. The entire freeway was projected to open by 2008, with the first phase opening in 2002. MDOT gave the South Beltline its numerical designation on the July 1999 edition of the state map, marking M-6 for the first time as a dotted line, to denote it was \"under construction\". The legislature approved Engler's \"Build Michigan III\" program in 2000; the plan accelerated road projects in the state. The capital outlay for the year was \\$82 million (equivalent to \\$ in ). Condemnation proceedings were initiated in the Kent County Circuit Court in 1999 to clear the way for the acquisitions. Land that contained homes, farms, trailer parks, and businesses was purchased by MDOT to acquire the right-of-way needed for the freeway. The land needed measured 360 feet (110 m) wide and 20 miles (32 km) long. Land acquisitions for the South Beltline Freeway were completed in July 2001. Construction started later in the fall of 2001 on the second and third phases of the project.\n\nThe first leg of the South Beltline Freeway, located between M-37 (Broadmoor Avenue) and I-96, was finished six months early. Dry summer weather allowed the roadbed contractors to finish their portion of the five-mile (8.0 km) section of the freeway early, earning them a \\$300,000 bonus (equivalent to \\$ in ). The overpasses for the remaining sections of the freeway were completed while the first phase was under construction, leaving the interchanges at US 131 and I-196 and the connecting roadbed to be completed at that time. The first section was paved in asphalt after MDOT reversed the decision to pave the whole freeway in concrete. That stretch of freeway opened to traffic on November 20, 2001. The state kept the overall project in an accelerated status headed into the next phases in 2002.\n\n","h_score":1755934.925,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1006150,"revid":1157063989,"description":"State highway in Michigan, United States","categories":["Freeways and expressways in Michigan","State highways in Michigan","Transportation in Kent County, Michigan","Transportation in Ottawa County, Michigan"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nMichigan\u2019s M-6 isn\u2019t just a highway\u2014it\u2019s a *time machine*.

Mars wore shades and a salmon-colored blazer. Their performance was well received by critics. Colin Joyce of Spin magazine praised Ronson's \"electric guitar performance\" describing it as something \"that Prince ... could have been proud of\". Joyce also commended the effortless singing and rapping skills of Mars. The Village Voice's Hillary Hugues praised the vocals by Mars, dance moves and the \"taut line between cheeky confidence and charm\" that he was able to walk. Iyana Robertson of Vibe complimented the \"groove\" of the song, as well as, the reenactment of \"the retro swag\" music video. The track was also performed live during the North American version of The Voice final on 16 December 2014. During the show, Mars and his band, The Hooligans, performed a rehearsed choreography, while the singer wore gold rollers in his hair. Critics found the use of rollers by Mars in his hair hilarious. Ronson and Mars performed \"Uptown Funk\" live on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on 13 January 2015. The performance began with Ronson demonstrating some of his DJ skills by scratching and doing hypeman work. Then Mars, dressed in a red blazer, snap back and black shades, and some of his band-mates, led the \"audience through some choreography\", before making their way to the stage, where Ellen also showed \"her little two-step\". Chris DeVille from Stereogum characterised the performance as a \"blast\", while NME's Nadia Khomami dubbed it \"energetic\". In the same vein, Shenequa Golding from Vibe, called the show \"dope\". In 2016, this performance earned them a nomination for a Daytime Emmy Award at the 43rd Daytime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. After Coldplay were announced as the lead performers for the Super Bowl 50 halftime show, Chris Martin asked Mars to join them, but he declined. Martin explained he wanted Mars to perform \"Uptown Funk\" with Beyonc\u00e9. Mars still did not think it was a good idea, but Beyonc\u00e9 was receptive to the idea. On 7 February 2016, the trio took the stage during the halftime show. Mark Ronson appeared handling DJ duties, while Mars and his dancers performed \"Uptown Funk\", wearing an all-black Versace outfit with gold chains. During the show, Beyonc\u00e9, in a Michael Jackson-inspired outfit appeared with a set of backing dancers dressed as Black Panthers. She performed her single \"Formation\" (2016) in choreography before being challenged by Mars to a dance-off, while singing the track. At that point Martin joined Beyonc\u00e9 and Mars singing the song. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times explained that Beyonc\u00e9 and Mars brought \"soul and funk\" to the show, while The Guardian's Alex Needham and Caroline Framke of Vox praised Beyonce \u0301s performance and criticised Mars and Coldplay's performance. During The Late Late Show with James Corden on 13 December 2016, Mars included \"Uptown Funk\" on the popular segment Carpool Karaoke.

Telangana had a higher concentration of land in the hands of a small group of landed magnates than the other regions. They owned vast tracts of lands covering several villages and thousands of acres. The land concentration was most pronounced in the districts of Nalgonda, Mahbubnagar and Warangal. They later became the epicenter of the insurrection. The peasants were largely dependent on affluent urban interests, mostly composed of Marwadis, Komtis, Brahmins and upper caste Muslims, who controlled the centralised markets in Telangana. Land alienation continued to increase between 1910 and 1940 as more land was passed either to urban interests and aristocratic durra landlords or to Marwadi and Maratha sahukars (money-lenders). Peasants with small landholding were pushed into landless agricultural labour or tenancy at will. Irrigation facilities were introduced from the late 19th century and a greater portion of the land transfer occurred on lands with these facilities. The system of subsistence farming gave way to commercial crops, strengthening the hold of traders and sahukars over the peasants, which was particularly worsened during the Great Depression. The period saw the rise of a section of well-to-do pattadars (landholding peasants) who began employing landless labourers of their own, though it did not change the landlord\u2013tenant relations in the region to any significant degree. The landholding peasants too were severely affected after the depression.","h_score":1754323.8,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":8312114,"revid":1161916170,"description":"1946\u20131951 peasant rebellion in India","categories":["1940s in India","20th-century rebellions","Communist rebellions","Conflicts in 1946","Conflicts in 1947","Conflicts in 1948","Conflicts in 1949","Conflicts in 1950","Conflicts in 1951","Hyderabad State","Peasant revolts","Rebellions in Asia","Revolutionary movement for Indian independence","Telangana Rebellion"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nThe **Telangana Rebellion (1946\u201348)** was a violent uprising against the **Nizam of Hyderabad**, India\u2019s last major princely state.

The painting was an example of realism and it portrayed an old man and a young man, both breaking rocks. The two men were meant to represent common workers doing menial tasks. They are shown in tattered clothing and their faces are turned away from the viewer.\n\nThe painting was displayed at the 1850 Paris Salon and it was criticized by many reviewers for its depiction of a subject which was not considered proper for high art. Additionally some critics disliked the application of very thick paint, and the poor lighting in the image. Conversely, social theorist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon praised the work and saw it as a successful socialist painting. He called the composition \"a masterpiece in its genre\". By 1915 it was considered to be an \"important work\".\n\nCourbet produced two versions of the painting. The version displayed at the 1850 Paris Salon was in the collection of the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden. At the time of its acquisition by the museum, the painting was referred to as \"Courbet's monumental masterpiece\". In February 1945, Dresden was bombed by the Allies of World War II. The Germans decided to relocate the painting but it was subsequently destroyed during a bombing raid while being relocated by truck to a safe storage. The second version, a reversed image, survived the war and is in the Oskar Reinhart Collection in Winterthur.\n\n","h_score":1752296.5062500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":24103709,"revid":1164890489,"description":"1849 painting by Gustave Courbet","categories":["1849 paintings","Lost paintings","Paintings by Gustave Courbet","Paintings of men","Realist paintings"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nPicture this: 1849.

Houses were built on inadequate foundations with substandard materials to reduce costs. Each house was separated by a single brick depth with a small room on each floor; ground-floor rooms served multiple purposes, while the remaining space was used for bedrooms. By the 1830s, back-to-back houses had a reputation nationwide for spreading disease, and major cities including Manchester and Liverpool prohibited their construction during the mid-19th century.\n\nThe Leeds Improvement Act of 1866 imposed regulations on new houses, to include gated yards, wider streets and improved interior design. The Medical Officer for Health unsuccessfully sought to abolish back-to-back construction in about 1880, by which time population density had improved to 200 people living in 50\u201360 houses per acre. In the late 19th century, the introduction of the byelaw terraced house to comply with the Public Health Act 1875 marked a significant change in housing design. In 1890, further improvements were introduced, including a basement or ground-floor kitchen, a small garden, and a private toilet for each household, as imposed by the Housing of the Working Classes Act 1885 and the Housing of the Working Classes Act 1890.\n\nHowever, Leeds was an exception, with figures from 1899 showing 72 percent of all houses constructed annually in the city being back-to-back, similar to 15 years prior, which didn't decrease until 1914. Small families with children in the city had little choice but to live in back-to-back houses as they were more affordable. Although the byelaw terraced house regulation was expected to prevent the construction of back-to-back houses, Leeds Council initially chose not to enforce it, allowing contractors to prioritize their interests ahead of build quality. This adversely affected the density and construction of housing in some areas, resulting in lower sale and rental prices compared to other towns that offered houses with greater space and improved sanitation. For instance, a new property built in Sunderland would have been provided with its own water closet, while a new property in Leeds may have had one shared, up until 1912.\n\n ### 20th century\n\n #### Before the First World War\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, back-to-back houses had become unpopular with residents and the government, who sought to ban their construction and eradicate existing properties nationwide due to concerns about health and ventilation. Residents of back-to-back houses had poor health, with increased mortality rates, infectious diseases, and diarrhoea. In Manchester, Dr James Niven noted that mortality rates among those living in back-to-back houses exceeded those from through-houses by 40%. In 1909, a change in the law forbade the erection of this style of house.\n\n #### Between the wars\n\nThe advent of council housing after the First World War resulted in councils organising programmes of statutory slum clearances as part of post-war housing redevelopment programmes. Such initiatives gathered pace in the 1920s, with the beginning of mass demolition of back-to-back houses and the construction of \"homes fit for heroes\".\n\nIn Leeds during the early 20th century, the local council had spent about \u00a31 million (equivalent to \u00a3 in ) in acquiring older, inadequate back-to-back houses for demolition, while continuing to build improved ones of a similar style until 1937, despite being outlawed in 1909 when it was decided that houses should be of an overall higher quality. By 1926, Leeds had 72,000 of these houses, of which 32,000 were described by Dr Christoper Addison as being \"abominations\", having been condemned as unfit for many years by that time, despite still being lived in; only 12,000 (less than 17 per cent) were given a moderate health pass by Neville Chamberlain's Unhealthy Areas Committee. Other cities had smaller numbers, such as Bradford (33,000) and Nottingham (5,000) respectively. MP Sir John Birchall described Leeds in 1930 as having \"an unenviable notoriety for its back-to-back houses\", although popularity among residents had increased. He unsuccessfully proposed in 1930 to permit the construction of back-to-back houses in blocks of four, given that back-to-backs were generally cheaper to build than standard through houses and that having two external walls per property would alleviate the ventilation concerns that plagued earlier residences.\n\n","h_score":1841702.3,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":2708396,"revid":1162247834,"description":"Form of terraced houses in the United Kingdom","categories":["Courtyards","House types in the United Kingdom","Industrial Revolution in England","Public health in the United Kingdom","Public housing in England","Slums in Europe","Urban studies and planning terminology","Working-class culture in the United Kingdom"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nPicture this: a house *inside* another house.

Developed as a spin-off of Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County, the series aired six seasons and focused on the personal and professional lives of several young women and men residing in Los Angeles, California. Its premise was conceived by Adam DiVello, while Liz Gateley and Sean Travis served as executive producers.\n\nThe series originally focused on Lauren Conrad, who appeared in its predecessor, as she pursued a career in the fashion industry. It additionally placed emphasis on her housemate Heidi Montag and their friends Audrina Patridge and Whitney Port. Conrad's friend Lo Bosworth and Montag's boyfriend Spencer Pratt developed major positions as part of the supporting cast in the second season, while his sister Stephanie Pratt was added in the third. Port left the series at the conclusion of the fourth season, moving to New York City and starring in her own spin-off, The City, which aired for two seasons.\n\nLooking to pursue other career opportunities, Conrad left the series halfway through the fifth season, and was subsequently replaced by fellow Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County cast member Kristin Cavallari. Bosworth and Stephanie Pratt joined Cavallari and Patridge as primary cast members in the sixth and final season, while Montag and her husband Pratt were removed from the series after displaying erratic behavior. Conrad briefly returned to the series during an alternate ending for its finale.\n\nThe Hills received moderately favorable reviews from critics, and has been recognized as a \"guilty pleasure\" by several media outlets. However, the series was often criticized for tending towards a narrative format more commonly seen in scripted genres including soap operas, and appearing to fabricate much of its storyline. The show has produced several spin-offs, as well as distributed all seasons to DVD.

Failing to capitalise on other chances to score, the Soviet Union conceded the equalising goal with two minutes of the match remaining when Kurt Hamrin struck the ball past Yashin to secure a 1\u20131 draw. The sides met two weeks later at the Central Lenin Stadium in front of almost 100,000 spectators and Yashin received the 1963 Ballon d'Or award on the pitch before the match. Ponedelnik opened the scoring for the Soviet Union when he ran with the ball before shooting between Arne Arvidsson's legs to make it 1\u20130 after 32 minutes, before doubling his and his side's tally 11 minutes into the second half with a 25-yard (23 m) strike. Hamrin scored past Yashin in the 78th minute before Valery Voronin shot the ball through Arvidsson's legs following a pass from Ponedelnik. The match ended 3\u20131 and 4\u20132 on aggregate to the Soviet Union who progressed to the semi-finals in Spain.\n\nThey faced Denmark at the Camp Nou in Barcelona on 17 June 1964 in front of 38,556 spectators. Denmark had enforced an \"amateur-only\" policy to their side which meant that Erik S\u00f8rensen, Kai Johansen and Harald Nielsen were no longer available having signed professional contracts, while Jens Peterson and John Madsen were also otherwise engaged. The Soviet Union dominated the early stages, Voronin opening the scoring midway through the first half from a corner before Ponedelnik beat Leif Nielsen in the Denmark goal with a strike five minutes before half-time. Late in the second half, Ivanov beat three Denmark defenders before scoring his side's third, and the Soviet Union won 3\u20130 to progress to their second consecutive European Nations' Cup final.\n\n ## Match\n\n ### Pre-match\n\nThe referee for the match was Arthur Holland, who became the second Englishman to officiate a European Nations' Cup Final after Arthur Ellis had fulfilled the role in the previous tournament. Before the match, Francisco Franco led future king of Spain Juan Carlos I onto the pitch while Yashin met his childhood hero Ricardo Zamora prior to kick-off. The Soviet Union had won the pre-match coin toss and as such were playing in their usual red-and-white kit while Spain wore dark blue shirts.\n\n","h_score":1839803.84375,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":18210594,"revid":1161554153,"description":"International football match","categories":["1960s in Madrid","1964 European Nations' Cup","Football in Madrid","June 1964 sports events in Europe","Soviet Union at the 1964 European Nations' Cup","Soviet Union national football team matches","Soviet Union\u2013Spain relations","Spain at the 1964 European Nations' Cup","Spain national football team matches","Sports competitions in Madrid","UEFA European Championship finals"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\n\u26bd *June 17, 1964.* The first-ever European Nations\u2019 Cup final.

We are committed to working closely with Pakistan and Afghanistan to prevent this from ever happening again.\" US Secretary of Defence Leon Panetta said in a separate statement that the US \"remains committed to improving our partnership with Pakistan and to working closely together as our two nations confront common security challenges in the region\", US General John R. Allen said in a statement that the agreement is \"a demonstration of Pakistan's desire to help secure a brighter future for both Afghanistan and the region at large.\" and NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen welcomed the announcement to reopen the supply lines, stating saying it highlighted the important role Pakistan has in supporting a stable future for Afghanistan. Pakistani reactions to the US apology were different. \"We appreciate Secretary Clinton's statement, and hope that bilateral ties can move to a better place from here. I am confident that both countries can agree on many critical issues, especially on bringing peace to the region,\" Pakistan's ambassador to the US Sherry Rehman said in a statement. In general the decision to reopen the supply routes was met in Pakistan with a general sense of befuddlement and muted criticism that the Pakistani government had given up a much-trumpeted increase in transit fees for NATO trucks. Opposition politicians criticised the move and demanded more of an explanation from the Pakistani government and military. \"Now government should let the people know about the terms and conditions for reopening the NATO supply lines. What were the demands?\" said former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi. Enver Baig, an opposition politician belonging to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz complained about Americans: \"They did not apologize. They said 'sorry.'\" Some Pakistani vowed civil disobedience to stop the convoys. \"The decision to reopen NATO supplies is a big crime against the country, and we will not sit silently over this,\" retired Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul, a leader of the Defense Council of Pakistan (a coalition of Islamic parties that includes pro-Taliban clerics and other foes of the NATO routes) and a former chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence agency, told the Pakistani cable channel Express News. \"We will come to roads and streets and protest against the decision and will also try to stop the supplies.\" Pakistani Taliban announced that they will attack any NATO supply trucks travelling along the routes. Transporters who resume supplies will be \"considered a friend of the U.S.\" and will face the consequences, a spokesman for the militant group said. Al Jazeera's Kamal Hyder said that both NATO and Pakistani forces had taken into account losses in the past. \"The losses, despite the fact that they have become a problem are nowhere near the levels that would cause alarm bells to ring\" the correspondent said.","h_score":1752878.675,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":33879727,"revid":1173000801,"description":"Afghanistan-Pakistan border skirmish","categories":["2011 NATO attack in Pakistan","2011 airstrikes","2011 in Pakistan","2011 in international relations","2011 in the United States","21st-century military history of the United States","Anti-Americanism","Anti-Pakistan sentiment","Articles containing video clips","Attacks in Pakistan in 2011","Battles involving Pakistan","Battles of the War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021) involving the United States","Conflicts in 2011","Controversies in Pakistan","Friendly fire incidents","Government of Yousaf Raza Gillani","Helicopter attacks","Insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa","Military history of Pakistan","Military operations involving NATO","Mohmand District","NATO airstrikes","NATO relations","November 2011 events in Pakistan","Obama administration controversies","Pakistan military scandals","Pakistani commissions and inquiries","Pakistan\u2013United States relations","United States military scandals","War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021)","War on terror"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"NATO\u2019s 2011 Pakistan Bombing: A Friendly Fire That Lit a Diplomatic Wildfire\"**\n\n*When a U.S. airstrike killed 24 Pakistani soldiers, it didn\u2019t just cross a border\u2014it torched a decade of trust.*\n\n---\n\n### **The Strike That Shook Two Nations**\nAt 1:30 AM on **November 26, 2011**, NATO warplanes\u2014mistaking a Pakistani military post for Taliban fighters\u2014unleashed hellfire on the Salala border checkpoint.

A \"varmint hunt\" was organized by John D. Lee around 1848, after the arrival of Mormon settlers. The final count of the hunt included \"two bears, two wolverines, two wildcats, 783 wolves, 409 foxes, 31 minks, nine eagles, 530 magpies, hawks and owls, and 1,026 ravens.\" None of the original large mammals is found along the Jordan River today; they have, for the most part, been replaced by raccoons, red foxes and domestic pets. Animals from the Jordan River area found on the Utah Sensitive Species List include the smooth green snake, the western toad, kit fox, spotted bat, and Townsend's big-eared bat.\n\nCombined with Utah Lake and the Great Salt Lake, the Jordan River offers one of the region's richest bird resources. Over 200 bird species use the river for breeding habitat or as a stop-over on their migratory routes. Once-common native species such as the willow flycatcher, gray catbird, warbling vireo, American redstart, black tern, and yellow-billed cuckoo are no longer found along the river. The common yellowthroat and yellow-breasted chat are still found in small isolated populations. The most common species now found are the black-billed magpie, mourning dove, western meadowlark, barn swallow, and the non-native ring-necked pheasant and starlings.\n\n ### Vegetation\n\nVegetation in the watershed is closely tied to elevation and precipitation levels. About 30 percent of the basin, mostly at higher elevation levels, is populated with oak, aspen and coniferous trees. At the lower levels, 27 percent of the basin is rich in mountain-brush, sagebrush, juniper and grasses. About 34 percent of the Jordan River basin is classified as urban.\n\nRussian olive and tamarisk or salt cedar trees now dominate the Jordan River floodplain where willow trees and cottonwood trees would once have been found. Plant species such as foxtail barley, saltgrass, rabbitbrush, cattails and other reeds are still found in small pockets along the river. Exotic pasture grasses such as orchard grass, bluegrass, redtop bentgrass, quackgrass, wheatgrass and fescue have become the common species of grass. The vulnerable flower, Ute's Ladies'-tresses, can also be found along the river.\n\n ## Pollution\n\nThe Jordan River has been a repository for waste since the settling of the Salt Lake Valley. For 100 years, raw, untreated sewage was dumped into the river; farming and animal runoff occurred; and mining operations led to 40 smelters being built and contaminating the river with heavy metals, mostly arsenic and lead. In 1962, the river in Midvale recorded a total coliform level of about 3 million per 100 milliliters, even though the state of Utah criteria for the total number of coliform bacteria in water samples should not exceed 5,000 per 100 milliliters. In 1965, a new sewage treatment plant came on-line in Salt Lake City that prevented 32,000,000 US gallons per day (120,000 m<sup>3<\/sup>\/d) of raw sewage from being dumped into a canal.\n\nThe Utah Division of Water Quality and Utah Division of Drinking Water are responsible for the regulation and management of water quality in the State of Utah. Streams that exceed the standard contamination levels are placed on the 303d list in accordance with the Clean Water Act. The Act also requires states to identify impaired water bodies every two years and develop a total maximum daily load (TMDL) for pollutants that may cause impairments in the various water bodies. The Jordan River and Little Cottonwood Creek were included on the 2006 303d list; parameters that exceeded the standard level for at least part of the Jordan River include temperature, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, E. Coli and salinity.\n\n","h_score":1770373.95625,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":480458,"revid":1156410183,"description":"River feeding the Great Salt Lake, USA","categories":["Rivers of Salt Lake County, Utah","Rivers of Utah","Rivers of Utah County, Utah","Tributaries of the Great Salt Lake"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nPicture this: a desert oasis where water carves secrets into stone.

The corps also completed the transition to complete Iraqi lead for security operations. During the deployment, III Corps reduced the amount of aviation assets in Iraq, resulting in one enhanced combat aviation brigade with six maneuver battalions having responsibility for the entire joint operations area. III Corps also oversaw the reduction of the force in Iraq from 110,000 to 50,000 U.S. personnel by 1 Sept. 2010, which established the conditions for the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom and the transition to Operation New Dawn. XVIII Airborne Corps from Fort Liberty, North Carolina, assumed the Iraq follow-on mission from III Corps in February 2011. The corps saw its first action in Afghanistan when it deployed to Kabul in early April 2013. The corps, under the command of LTG Mark A. Milley, replaced the U.S. V Corps from Stuttgart, Germany, in May 2013 and assumed the mission of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) Joint Command, or IJC, which was responsible for day-to-day operations throughout Afghanistan. During the corps' deployment, IJC oversaw Milestone 13\/Tranche 5 ceremony on 18 June 2013, which marked the official transition of full responsibility for nationwide security operations from ISAF to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. After the Milestone 13 ceremony, IJC transitioned from Coalition-led combat operations to Afghan-led combat operations and Coalition forces providing training, advice, and assistance. The ANSF, officially less than three years old, reached its peak of more than 350,000 members and conducted more than 70 major operations in more than 22 provinces. In November 2013, IJC forces provided technical support to the ANSF as it secured the Loya Jirga, a country-wide gathering of Afghan local leaders and officials, in Kabul. The Loya Jirga successfully laid the groundwork for a U.S.-Afghanistan Bilateral Security Agreement.

The cyclists competed in 21 stages over 23 days, covering a distance of 3,430.5 kilometres (2,131.6 mi). The route entered Italy for part of two stages. The emphasis of the route was on the Alps, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the mountain range first being visited in the Tour. Cadel Evans of the won the overall general classification.

In the following stage, 's victory in the team time trial put their rider Thor Hushovd into the overall lead. He held the yellow jersey until the end of the ninth stage when it was taken by Thomas Voeckler (), who went on to hold it throughout the stages in the Pyrenees and up until the end of the final Alpine stage. Andy Schleck, who had won the previous stage (the 18th), held it for the following individual time trial; Evans took enough time in this stage to take the yellow jersey. He then held the lead into the finish in Paris.\n\nThe race saw Yohann G\u00e8ne become the first black rider in the history of the Tour. Evans became the first Australian to win the Tour, and the second non-European to have officially done so.

After the defeat of Melkor, the Valar gave the island to the three loyal houses of Men who had aided the Elves in the war against him. Through the favour of the Valar, the D\u00fanedain were granted wisdom and power and longer life, beyond that of other Men. Indeed, the isle of N\u00famenor lay closer to Aman than to Middle-earth. The fall of N\u00famenor came about through the influence of the corrupted Maia Sauron, the chief servant of Melkor, who arose during the Second Age and tried to conquer Middle-earth. The N\u00famen\u00f3reans moved against Sauron. They were so powerful that Sauron perceived that he could not defeat them by force. He surrendered himself to be taken as a prisoner to N\u00famenor. There he quickly enthralled the king, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n, urging him to seek the immortality that the Valar had apparently denied him, fanning the envy that many of the N\u00famen\u00f3reans had begun to hold against the Elves of the West and the Valar. The people of N\u00famenor strove to avoid death, but this only weakened them and sped the gradual diminishing of their lifespans. Sauron urged them to wage war against the Valar to seize the immortality denied them. Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n raised the mightiest army and fleet N\u00famenor had ever seen, and sailed against Aman. The Valar and Elves of Aman, stricken with grief over their betrayal, called on Il\u00favatar for help. When Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n landed, Il\u00favatar destroyed his forces and sent a great wave to submerge N\u00famenor, killing all but those N\u00famen\u00f3reans who had remained loyal to the Valar. The world was remade, and Aman was removed beyond the Uttermost West so that Men could not sail there to threaten it. Sauron's physical manifestation was destroyed in the ruin of N\u00famenor. As a Maia, his spirit returned to Middle-earth, though he was no longer able to take the fair form he had once had. The loyal N\u00famen\u00f3reans reached the shores of Middle-earth. Among these survivors were Elendil, their leader and a descendant of Elros, and his sons Isildur and An\u00e1rion, who had saved a seedling from N\u00famenor's white tree, the ancestor of that of Gondor. They founded two kingdoms: Arnor in the north and Gondor in the south. Elendil reigned as High King of both kingdoms, but committed the rule of Gondor jointly to Isildur and An\u00e1rion. The power of the kingdoms in exile was greatly diminished from that of N\u00famenor, \"yet very great it seemed to the wild men of Middle-earth\". ### Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age\n\nThe concluding section of the book, comprising about 20 pages, describes the events that take place in Middle-earth during the Second and Third Ages. In the Second Age, Sauron re-emerged in Middle-earth. The Rings of Power were forged by Elves led by Celebrimbor, but Sauron secretly forged One Ring to control the others. War broke out between the peoples of Middle-earth and Sauron, culminating in the War of the Last Alliance, in which Elves led by Gil-galad and the remaining N\u00famen\u00f3reans led by Elendil united to defeat Sauron, bringing the Second Age to an end. The Third Age began with the claiming of the One Ring by Isildur after Sauron's overthrow. Isildur was ambushed by orcs and killed at the Gladden Fields shortly afterwards, and the One Ring was lost in the River Anduin. The section gives a brief overview of the events leading up to and taking place in The Lord of the Rings, including the waning of Gondor, the re-emergence of Sauron, the White Council, Saruman's treachery, and Sauron's final destruction along with the One Ring, which ends the Third Age.\n\n ### Illustrations\n\nThe inside title page contains an English inscription written in Tengwar script. It reads \"The tales of the First Age when Morgoth dwelt in Middle-earth and the Elves made war upon him for the recovery of the Silmarils to which are appended the downfall of N\u00famenor and the history of the Rings of Power and the Third Age in which these tales come to their end.\"\n\nInside the back cover is a fold-out map of part of Middle-earth, Beleriand in the First Age.\n\n ## Publication\n\nThe first edition was brought out in hardback by Allen & Unwin in 1977. HarperCollins published a paperback edition in 1999, and an illustrated edition with colour plates by Ted Nasmith in 2008. It has sold over a million copies, far fewer than The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings which have each sold over 100 million copies. Its sales were sufficient for it to reach the top of the October 1977 lists. It has since been translated into at least 40 languages.\n\n ## Concept and creation\n\n","h_score":1822639.6187500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":27866702,"revid":1172916963,"description":"Collection of J.

His son Christopher pieced it together, but purists debate what was \u201cmeant\u201d to be. Today, it\u2019s a cult favorite\u2014dense, poetic, and unapologetically melancholic. For readers willing to dive in, it\u2019s a reward; for others, a challenge. Either way, it\u2019s the bedrock of modern fantasy.\n\n*The next great mythic retelling might not rewrite history\u2014but it\u2019ll have to reckon with Tolkien\u2019s.*"}

Duke Ellington performed the song at the club, while the revue Hot Chocolates featured a version by Louis Armstrong.\n\nWhile Carmichael worked for RCA Records as a session jazz ensemble leader, journalist Walter Winchell promoted the song.

By 1931, \"Stardust\" was often played by the orchestras of several US radio stations. While remarking on the popularity of the tune on the radio, the Calgary Herald opined of Jones's version: \"This beautiful melody seems destined to archive the popularity which it so richly deserves and which is so long overdue.\" In August 1931, Bing Crosby released the song as \"Star Dust\" on Brunswick Records. The same year, Lee Sims also released \"Stardust\" on Brunswick 6132, a version that the Sydney Morning Herald called \"a melody of a considerable intensity and with dramatic outbursts,\" with a \"realistic and very full\" piano reproduction.

The original motte and bailey castle was built in the late 11th century by Norman invaders on top of a 3rd-century Roman fort. The castle was commissioned either by William the Conqueror or by Robert Fitzhamon, and formed the heart of the medieval town of Cardiff and the Marcher Lord territory of Glamorgan. In the 12th century the castle began to be rebuilt in stone, probably by Robert of Gloucester, with a shell keep and substantial defensive walls being erected. Further work was conducted by the 6th Earl of Gloucester in the second half of the 13th century. Cardiff Castle was repeatedly involved in the conflicts between the Anglo-Normans and the Welsh, being attacked several times in the 12th century, and stormed in 1404 during the revolt of Owain Glynd\u0175r. After being held by the de Clare and Despenser families for several centuries, the castle was acquired by The 13th Earl of Warwick and Comte de Aumale in 1423. Lord Warwick conducted extensive work on the castle, founding the main range on the west side of the castle, dominated by a tall octagonal tower. Following the Wars of the Roses, the status of the castle as a Marcher territory was revoked and its military significance began to decline. The Herbert family took over the property in 1550, remodelling parts of the main range and carrying out construction work in the outer bailey, then occupied by Cardiff's Shire Hall and other buildings. During the English Civil War Cardiff Castle was initially taken by a Parliamentary force, but was regained by Royalist supporters in 1645. When fighting broke out again in 1648, a Royalist army attacked Cardiff in a bid to regain the castle, leading to the Battle of St Fagans just outside the city. Cardiff Castle escaped potential destruction by Parliament after the war and was instead garrisoned, probably to protect against a possible Scottish invasion. In the mid-18th century, Cardiff Castle passed into the hands of the Stuart dynasty, Marquesses of Bute. John, 1st Marquess of Bute, employed Capability Brown and Henry Holland to renovate the main range, turning it into a Georgian mansion, and to landscape the castle grounds, demolishing many of the older medieval buildings and walls. During the first half of the 19th century the family became extremely wealthy as a result of the growth of the coal industry in Glamorgan. However, it was the 3rd Marquess of Bute who truly transformed the castle, using his vast wealth to back an extensive programme of renovations under William Burges. Burges remodelled the castle in a Gothic revival style, lavishing money and attention on the main range. The resulting interior designs are considered to be amongst \"the most magnificent that the gothic revival ever achieved\". The grounds were re-landscaped and, following the discovery of the old Roman remains, reconstructed walls and a gatehouse in a Roman style were incorporated into the castle design. Extensive landscaped parks were built around the outside of the castle. In the early 20th century, the 4th Marquess of Bute inherited the castle and construction work continued into the 1920s. The Bute lands and commercial interests around Cardiff were sold off or nationalised until, by the time of the Second World War, little was left except the castle. During the war, extensive air raid shelters were built in the castle walls; they could hold up to 1,800 people. When the 4th Marquess died in 1947, the castle was given to the City of Cardiff. Today the castle is run as a tourist attraction, with the grounds housing the \"Firing Line\" regimental museum and interpretation centre. The castle also serves as a venue for events, including musical performances and festivals. ## History\n\n ### 1st\u20134th centuries AD\n\nThe future site of Cardiff Castle was first used by the Romans as a defensive location for many years. The first fort was probably built about AD 55 and occupied until AD 80. It was a rectangular structure much larger than the current site, and formed part of the southern Roman border in Wales during the conquest of the Silures. When the border advanced, defences became less important and the fort was replaced with a sequence of two, much smaller, fortifications on the north side of the current site.\n\nA fourth fort was built in the middle of the 3rd century in order to combat the pirate threat along the coast, and forms the basis of the Roman remains seen on the castle site. The fort was almost square in design, approximately 635 feet (194 m) by 603 feet (184 m) large, constructed from limestone brought by sea from Penarth. The fort's irregular shape was determined by the River Taff that flowed along the west side of the walls. The sea would have come much closer to the site than is the case in the 21st century, and the fort would have directly overlooked the harbour.

One was The Idolmaster series of games developed by Bandai Namco Entertainment first released as an arcade game in 2005. Initial games had players taking the role of a manager of rising stars (idols) managing their schedules through mini-games, which include performing in auditions similar to a rhythm game approach. The other direction came from the introduction of the virtual idol of Hatsune Miku by Crypton Future Media for its line of Vocaloid sound synthesis software in 2007. Using Vocaloid, software users could have Miku mimic singing and dancing to the music created in Vocaloid, and many of these videos became popular on the Japanese media sharing site Niconico. The popularity of the Miku's videos led to other similar videos based on other popular characters including those out of the Idolmaster series.\n\nThe next Idolmaster game, The Idolmaster Live For You! in 2008, focused more on the performance mini-games, which led for most remaining games of the series to be virtual idol rhythm games. Similarly, as Crypton continue to expand on Miku and other virtual idols for Vocaloid, they expanded to licensing those idols for video games, collaborating with Sega to create the Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA debuting in 2009.\n\nThese games were initially mostly for consoles, but mobile game versions of these series appeared in 2012 (Miku Flick for the Miku series) and 2013 (The Idolmaster Shiny Festa), and numerous mobile-based virtual idol rhythm games followed, such as Love Live!, BanG Dream! Uta no Prince-sama and Ensemble Stars!. Many of these games were freemium games based on existing anime or manga properties, and typically included gacha-type mechanisms to be profitable.\n\n","h_score":1789867.8625,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":939218,"revid":1169445250,"description":"Genre of music-themed action video game","categories":["Rhythm games","Video game genres","Video game terminology"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Beat the Clock: How Rhythm Games Turned Play into a Global Pulse\"**\n\n*From arcade classics to esports arenas, rhythm games sync music and movement\u2014proving that the perfect beat isn\u2019t just fun, it\u2019s a cultural phenomenon.*\n\n---\n\n### **The Beat Behind the Game**\nRhythm games\u2014where players tap, swipe, or dance to music\u2014blend precision with passion.

She said of it, \"I loved that play. It's the most lovely modern play I've played\", but the piece was not a great box-office success and closed after 188 performances. In 1961 Thorndike played the longest part of her career, the title role in Hugh Ross Williamson's Teresa of Avila, about the eponymous saint. She thought it \"the most thrilling part I've been offered since Saint Joan\", but Williamson's script, even after extensive revision by Casson, proved disappointing. Reviews were enthusiastic in their praise of Thorndike's performance, but neither the critics nor the public liked the play, which closed after six weeks. In 1962 Olivier, as director of the Chichester Festival, mounted a production of Uncle Vanya. He assembled a cast headed by Michael Redgrave in the title role, supported by Olivier (as Astrov), Fay Compton, Joan Greenwood and Joan Plowright, in addition to Thorndike as Marina, the nurse, and Casson as Waffles. The critic J. C. Trewin wrote of \"the most remarkably complete production \u2013 in my experience at least \u2013 of any play in our period\". He called Thorndike's nurse \"a miracle of gruff tenderness\". The production was acknowledged as the highlight of the festival, and was revived the following year. Between the two stagings Thorndike appeared for the first time in a musical \u2013 playing the formidable Miss Crawley in an adaptation of Thackeray's Vanity Fair. The piece received bad reviews. The Guardian said that at her age Thorndike \"should have known better than be caught up in this piece of prolonged nonsense\", although The Times found consolation in her \"blazingly theatrical figure\" who \"stamps every line with comic authority\". Olivier moved from Chichester to become the founding director of the National Theatre in late 1963. He included Uncle Vanya in his first season, with many of his Chichester cast reprising their roles, but Casson, by this time in his late eighties, declined, and Thorndike did likewise. At the Duchess Theatre in January 1964 she appeared as the Dowager Countess of Lister in William Douglas-Home's play The Reluctant Peer, a comic fictionalisation of the author's elder brother's recent renunciation of his peerage so as to be eligible for the premiership. Once again, Thorndike's notices were better than those for the play. Bernard Levin wrote, \"she gets her fangs deep into the meatiest part she has had for years\" and praised \"the relish and zest she brings to her playing\". She thought the critics were wrong to dismiss the play \u2013 \"they only want avant-garde and classics now\" \u2013 and was sorry when her contractual commitments forced her to leave the cast six months into the eighteen-month run.","h_score":1829351.89375,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1114056,"revid":1150899158,"description":"English actress (1882\u20131976)","categories":["1882 births","1976 deaths","20th-century English actresses","Actresses awarded damehoods","Anglican pacifists","Burials at Westminster Abbey","Dames Commander of the Order of the British Empire","English Christian pacifists","English Christian socialists","English Shakespearean actresses","English film actresses","English silent film actresses","English stage actresses","Female Christian socialists","Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour","People educated at Rochester Grammar School","People from Gainsborough, Lincolnshire","People from Rochester, Kent","Wives of knights"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Sybil Thorndike: The Stage Queen Who Stole the 20th Century\"**\n\n*From Shakespearean tragedies to wartime radio, this fiery British actress redefined acting\u2014and refused to play by the rules.*\n\n---\n\n**A Star Born of Fire and Fury**\nSybil Thorndike (1882\u20131976) was a force of nature: a towering, red-haired actress whose voice could command a theater and whose temper could silence a studio. Born into a theatrical family, she defied convention early, leaving a loveless marriage to pursue acting full-time. By the 1920s, she was a West End legend, known for her electrifying performances in *Macbeth* and *The Duchess of Malfi*\u2014roles that demanded as much raw emotion as they did technical precision. \"She didn\u2019t just act,\" recalled director Tyrone Guthrie. \"She *burned*.\"\n\n---\n\n**War, Radio, and a New Kind of Stardom**\nWhen World War II erupted, Thorndike swapped the stage for the airwaves, becoming one of Britain\u2019s most beloved radio voices.

As critic Kenneth Tynan put it, \"She was the last of the great *players*\u2014not stars, not celebrities, but women who made the stage their kingdom.\" Today, her fearless spirit endures in every actor who dares to demand more from their craft.\n\n*The question isn\u2019t whether theater will ever see her like again\u2014but whether it\u2019s brave enough to try.*"}

Matthews scored the third goal as England beat the Welsh 4\u20130. His second game would be the infamous Battle of Highbury, where he set up Eric Brook for the first goal of a 3\u20132 win over world champions Italy. The Italians turned the match into a \"bloodbath\", and it ended up as the most violent match that Matthews would ever be involved in. His third cap came in a 3\u20130 over Germany at White Hart Lane on 4 December 1935, after Ralph Birkett was unable to play due to injury; Matthews was outplayed by his opposite number Reinhold M\u00fcnzenberg in both attack and defence. Matthews was jeered by England supporters and condemned by the press. He would have to wait until 17 April 1937 for another chance in an England shirt, when he was selected to play in front of 149,000 spectators against the auld enemy at Scotland's Hampden Park. He was physically sick before the match, as he would be before any big game. The \"Hampden Roar\" a big factor, the Scots won 3\u20131 despite a good English performance. After another game against Wales, Matthews scored a hat-trick in a 5\u20134 win against Czechoslovakia. In 1938 he played eight games for England, starting with defeat to a Scotland team containing a young Bill Shankly. He then travelled to Berlin for another encounter with M\u00fcnzenberg, where pre-match he witnessed first hand the foreboding devotion the people showed the F\u00fchrer when his motorcade drove past a caf\u00e9 the England team were dining in. The game became infamous as The FA, themselves under instruction from the British government, informed the England team that they had to perform the Nazi salute as part of the strategy of appeasement. England won 6\u20133 with Matthews himself getting on the scoreboard having got the better of M\u00fcnzenberg this time. The next game was a shock 2\u20131 defeat to Switzerland, which in turn was followed by a 4\u20132 win over France in Paris. Following the conclusion of this summer tour of the continent, Matthews scored in a 4\u20132 defeat to Wales in Cardiff, and then played in England's 3\u20130 win over a Europe XI at Highbury, their 4\u20130 win over Norway in Newcastle, and their 7\u20130 win over Ireland at Old Trafford. On 15 April 1939, he returned to a muddy Hampden Park with England to claim a 2\u20131 victory in front of 142,000 rain-soaked supporters; he set up Tommy Lawton for the winner with seconds to spare. That summer was the last time the England would tour Europe before Hitler's Nazis were defeated. The first game was against Italy, who gave the English a warm reception despite Benito Mussolini's breast-beating and the bad blood of five years previous.

On February 12, 1943, he enlisted at the U.S. Navy's recruiting officer at Lowry Field near Denver. He then traveled to the headquarters of the 12th Naval District in San Francisco, where he was accepted into the Navy's V-5 Aviation Cadet Training Program. The Navy had recruited plenty of potential aviators at this time, so to retain young men like Carpenter, the V-12 Navy College Training Program was created, whereby cadets attended college until their service was required. When Carpenter graduated from high school, he became a V-12A aviation cadet at Colorado College in Colorado Springs. Three semesters there were followed by six months of preflight training at Saint Mary's College of California in Moraga, California, and primary flight training at Ottumwa, Iowa, in a Stearman N2S for four months. The war ended before he finished training, so the Navy released him from active duty in September 1945. After visiting his father and stepmother in New York, Carpenter returned to Boulder in November 1945 to study aeronautical engineering at the University of Colorado at Boulder. He was given credit for his previous study, and entered as a junior. While there he joined Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity. He was severely injured in a car accident on September 14, 1946, after he fell asleep at the wheel of his 1934 Ford. The car went over a cliff and overturned. At the end of his senior year, he missed his final examination in heat transfer; a washed-out bridge prevented him from getting to class. This left him one requirement short of a degree. On May 29, 1962, after his Mercury flight, the university granted him his Bachelor of Science degree because \"his subsequent training as an astronaut more than made up for the deficiency in the subject of heat transfer.\" Carpenter met Rene Louise Price, a fellow student at the University of Colorado, where she studied history and music. She was a member of the Delta Delta Delta sorority. Her parents had also separated when she was young, and her mother too suffered from tuberculosis. They were married at St. John's Episcopal Church in Boulder in September 1948. On October 31, 1949, Carpenter was recruited by the Navy's Direct Procurement Program (DPP) as its 500th candidate. He reported to Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, for pre-flight training, from which he graduated on March 6, 1950. He then commenced primary flight training at Naval Air Station Whiting Field, learning to fly in an SNJ trainer. He then went to Naval Air Station Corpus Christi for advanced training. Most newly-trained naval aviators\u2014including Carpenter\u2014aspired to fly jet fighters, but in view of his responsibilities as a husband and father, he elected the less dangerous option of flying multi-engine patrol aircraft, and his advanced training was in the Consolidated PB4Y-2 Privateer, a single-tail version of the Consolidated B-24 Liberator.","h_score":1798166.7312500002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":331379,"revid":1171644417,"description":"American test pilot, astronaut and aquanaut (1925\u20132013)","categories":["1925 births","1962 in spaceflight","2013 deaths","20th-century American businesspeople","American Korean War pilots","American aerospace engineers","American autobiographers","American business executives","American male non-fiction writers","American test pilots","American underwater divers","Aquanauts","Aviators from Colorado","Collier Trophy recipients","Mercury Seven","NASA people","People from Boulder, Colorado","Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)","Recipients of the Legion of Merit","Recipients of the NASA Distinguished Service Medal","Rehoboth Carpenter family","Scott Carpenter","United States Astronaut Hall of Fame inductees","United States Naval Aviators","United States Naval Test Pilot School alumni","United States Navy astronauts","United States Navy officers","United States Navy personnel of World War II","United States Navy personnel of the Korean War","University of Colorado alumni","Writers from Colorado"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"From the Deep to the Stars: Scott Carpenter\u2019s Forgotten Legacy\"**\n\n*America\u2019s second man in space was also a trailblazer in oceanography\u2014yet his story remains half-submerged in history.*\n\n---\n\n### **Astronaut, Adventurer, and All-Around Explorer**\nScott Carpenter wasn\u2019t just the second American to orbit Earth\u2014he was a man who thrived in the unknown.

It was held on 5 October at the 5.807 km (3.608 mi) 18-turn Suzuka Circuit in Suzuka, Mie. The event's official name was the 2014 Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix, and it was scheduled to last 53 laps over a distance of 307.471 km (191.054 mi). Tyre supplier Pirelli brought four types of tyre to the race: two dry compounds (the white-banded medium \"options\" and the orange-banded hard \"primes\") and two wet-weather compounds (intermediate and full wet). The drag reduction system (DRS) had one activation zone for the race, on the straight linking the final and first corners. The circuit underwent changes following the previous year's race; parts of the track between the 14th and 15th turns were resurfaced, TecPro barriers were installed on the inside after the exit of turn 15 and lamp posts near debris fences outside turns 13 and 14 were moved back. Going into the race, Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton led the Drivers' Championship with 241 points, three ahead of teammate Nico Rosberg, with Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo third with 181. Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso was fourth with 133, followed by Ricciardo's teammate Sebastian Vettel with 124. Mercedes led the Constructors' Championship with 479 points, having won eleven of the previous fourteen races of the season, while Red Bull were second with 305 points, having won the other three races; they were followed by Williams (187), Ferrari (178) and Force India (117). Mercedes had to outscore Red Bull by 41 points to clinch the Constructors' title in Japan. Despite reclaiming the Drivers' Championship lead at the preceding , Hamilton said that he was not relieved because of the closeness of the race. He said that he would take Rosberg's race-by-race approach and was happy to be performing well. Hamilton, who had yet to win the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, aimed for a victory at the circuit. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said that the championship was out of their reach, although he hoped further reliability problems with the Mercedes cars would prolong the battle. Horner ruled out team orders favouring one driver over the other. Rosberg said he was looking forward to the race, and his car's speed gave him hope for a good result. Typhoon Phanfone, classified as a category-four storm, was forecast to make landfall over the eastern Japanese coast on race day with heavy rain and winds of up to 240 km\/h (150 mph). Although the storm was predicted to miss Suzuka, heavy rain from its northern edge was expected to drench the circuit. The , scheduled for the following week, made it impossible for the Japanese Grand Prix to be postponed until Monday due to freight schedules to Russia for the teams' equipment. Bernie Ecclestone, owner of Formula One's commercial rights, raised the possibility of moving up the start time, but later said that the event would proceed as planned. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) race director, Charlie Whiting, suggested to race organisers that the start time be moved and warned them that the race would not take place unless it was declared safe, but they refused. Honda, the owners of the track, reportedly rejected the start time change to allow spectators to arrive at Suzuka in time for the start. Whiting was also overruled by senior FIA officials, who opposed the disruption of the event's worldwide television coverage. There were 11 teams (each representing a different constructor) entering two race drivers for the event and two free practice session participants. Max Verstappen replaced Jean-\u00c9ric Vergne as part of his preparation for a full-time seat at Toro Rosso in the 2015 season. Aged 17 years and three days, Verstappen was the youngest person in history to participate in a Formula One race weekend. Caterham confirmed that Roberto Merhi would replace Marcus Ericsson, and Kamui Kobayashi would drive in the race. Formula Renault 3.5 Series driver Will Stevens was announced as participating in the first practice session in Max Chilton's car, but a problem with paperwork sent to the FIA Contract Recognition Board due to an industrial action in Germany prevented him from driving.","h_score":1805475.84375,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":40685706,"revid":1149764693,"description":"Formula One motor race","categories":["2014 Formula One races","2014 in Japanese motorsport","Formula One controversies","Japanese Grand Prix","October 2014 sports events in Japan"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Rosberg\u2019s Redemption: How a Rain-Soaked Suzuka Crowned a Champion\"**\n\n*In 2014, a torrential downpour at the Japanese Grand Prix handed Nico Rosberg a dramatic victory\u2014and Mercedes a title-clinching lead.

Dry conditions at the start saw Lewis Hamilton dominate, but as the skies darkened, so did his fortunes. \"The moment the rain hit, the track turned into a skating rink,\" recalled Mercedes strategist Ron Meadows. \"We had to gamble\u2014and we got it right.\" Rosberg, starting 11th, seized his chance, climbing through the field as Hamilton\u2019s tires betrayed him. By lap 30, the German led a Mercedes 1-2, the team\u2019s first constructor\u2019s title secured in a storm of emotion.\n\n---\n\n### **The Title That Wasn\u2019t (Yet)**\nWith three races remaining, Rosberg\u2019s win at Suzuka didn\u2019t just pad his points\u2014it shattered the narrative. \"I knew if I didn\u2019t win here, the pressure would crush me,\" Rosberg admitted post-race. The victory wasn\u2019t just personal; it was a statement. Hamilton, though gracious, faced the harsh math: a 17-point deficit to his teammate, with only two races left to overturn it. The podium celebrations were bittersweet, a foreshadowing of the tense finale to come.\n\n---\n### **Legacy in the Rain**\nSuzuka 2014 became a turning point, not just for Rosberg\u2019s confidence, but for Mercedes\u2019 dominance. The rain, often a villain in Formula 1, became the hero of a underdog story\u2014one that would echo through the season\u2019s final chapters. As the lights faded on Japan, the stage was set for a title fight for the ages.\n\n*The 2014 season\u2019s drama wouldn\u2019t end in Suzuka\u2014but it would never be the same again.*"}

Gardermoen is located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) north of Oslo, but is not located on the Hoved Line. A different right-of-way had to be chosen north of Kl\u00f8fta. The Hoved Line has heavy traffic, with many small stops until Lillestr\u00f8m, and continues northwards from Lillestr\u00f8m as single track. Therefore, an all-new railway would have to be built; it would bypass the intermediate railway until Lillestr\u00f8m, running through a tunnel, and continue northwards to the airport and onwards to Eidsvoll. This northernmost part is 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) used to allow trains operating on the Dovre Line to Lillehammer and Trondheim to use the Gardermoen Line.\n\nThe Gardermoen Line was the second attempt to build a high-speed railway in Norway. The first was the 35-kilometre (22 mi) line from Ski to Moss on the \u00d8stfold Line. However, operational speeds in excess of 160 kilometres per hour (99 mph) could not be achieved due to the short distances and limitations on rolling stock. The Gardermoen Line, therefore, became the first real high-speed railway line in Norway. Due to the domination of single track in Norway, the 64-kilometre (40 mi) Gardermoen Line increased the total length of double track in the kingdom by more than 50%.\n\nThe projected costs of the railway line were NOK 4.3 billion \u00b120%. Total costs ended at NOK 7.7 billion, including 1.3 billion extra used on extraordinary expenditures on the Romeriksporten. On 1 October 1996 it was decided that the construction company, NSB Gardermobanen, would also become the operator of the airport express train. However, due to limited profitability with the company, from 1 January 2001 the ownership of Gardermobanen was transferred to the Norwegian National Rail Administration, who also owns the rest of railway lines in Norway. The operating company changed its name to Flytoget AS.\n\n","h_score":1780404.5125000002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":3142190,"revid":1149190836,"description":"Railway line in Norway","categories":["1998 establishments in Norway","Airport rail links","Electric railways in Norway","Flytoget","Gardermoen Line","High-speed railway lines in Norway","Oslo Airport, Gardermoen","Railway lines in Oslo","Railway lines in Viken","Railway lines opened in 1998"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Gardermoen Line: Norway\u2019s High-Speed Gamble on a Train That\u2019s Always Late\"**\n\n*Norway\u2019s \u20ac20 billion bullet train\u2014meant to whisk Oslo to the Arctic in 2 hours\u2014is stuck in the slow lane.

Planned since 2000, the 200 km route\u2014linking Oslo to Trondheim via the airport\u2014has ballooned from a modest upgrade to a futuristic fantasy, with tunnels carved through mountains and bridges spanning fjords. \"We\u2019re not just building a train line,\" said Transport Minister *Hadria Kyeng*, in a 2022 press conference. \"We\u2019re building a *symbol*\u2014of progress, of unity, of Norway\u2019s refusal to be left behind.\" Critics call it a white elephant with a carbon footprint.\n\n---\n\n### **The Numbers That Don\u2019t Add Up**\nThe project\u2019s budget has swollen like a winter avalanche: from \u20ac8.4 billion in 2016 to \u20ac20 billion today, with no end in sight.

Environmental groups scream over deforested valleys, while economists question whether 1.5 million annual passengers will justify the cost. \"This isn\u2019t infrastructure,\" snapped *Erik Solheim*, a former environment minister turned vocal opponent. \"It\u2019s a vanity project for engineers who\u2019ve never met a spreadsheet they didn\u2019t love.\"\n\n---\n### **The Arctic Express: Hype or Hope?**\nWhen finished, the Gardermoen Line will slash Oslo\u2013Trondheim travel time from 7 to 2 hours, but its real selling point is the Arctic: a direct link to Bod\u00f8 by 2040, turning Norway\u2019s northern reaches from a logistical nightmare into a viable commute. The catch? Climate change is rewriting the rules. Permafrost thaw threatens tunnels, while rising sea levels eye coastal tracks. Yet supporters argue the line is *future-proof*\u2014a bet that Norway\u2019s oil wealth can outrun its melting glaciers.\n\n*The question isn\u2019t whether the Gardermoen Line will arrive\u2014it\u2019s whether Norway will still recognize the country it\u2019s trying to reach by the time it does.*"}

On January 29, he was named a Rising Stars Challenge participant as part of the 2014 NBA All-Star Game weekend. On February 7, he was selected to replace Kobe Bryant in the 2014 NBA All-Star Game. On February 26, Davis sprained his left shoulder late in the first half against the Dallas Mavericks. He did not play in the rest of the game, and his subsequent availability was listed as day-to-day. Despite his shoulder sprain, Davis matched his career high with 32 points on February 28 against the Phoenix Suns. He was one of six Western Conference Player of the Week nominees on March 10. On March 14, Davis established a career high with 36 points against Portland. On March 16, 2014, (the very next game) Davis scored a career-high 40 points along with a career-high 21 rebounds in a 121\u2013120 overtime win against the Boston Celtics. The performance was the first 40-point, 20-rebound effort of the 2013\u201314 NBA season. Davis was the fourth-youngest player (21 years and 5 days) to achieve 40\/20 in a game and the youngest since Shaquille O'Neal in 1993. In addition to his career game, Davis set a New Orleans' franchise record with six straight games of at least 28 points. Glen Rice set the previous best stretch with five straight in the 1990s. It was also the first 40-point performance by a Pelican\/Hornet since David West on February 26, 2010. Davis was again a finalist for NBA Player of the Week on March 17 and 24. In late March, Davis began suffering a series of injuries. On March 28, Davis injured his left ankle, after four minutes of play against the Jazz. He missed the rest of the game and the next one. Davis returned to the lineup on March 31 against Sacramento. However, on April 2, Davis endured back spasms that caused him to miss the second half against the Nuggets. Davis saw limited minutes on April 4 and missed a game on April 9 due to his back. On April 10, the team announced that Davis would miss the remaining four games.

Neither was the world. #SkateHistory\n\n---\n\n**2\/10**\nPicture this: 1902. Figure skating is a *men\u2019s* sport. Judges refuse to let women compete. Madge Syers? She *demands* a spot.

She outskated him *and* outlasted his protests.\n\n---\n\n**4\/10**\nHere\u2019s the kicker: Syers wasn\u2019t just *good*. She was *revolutionary*. She introduced *artistry* to skating\u2014emotion, storytelling, *dramatic flair*. Before her, it was jumps and footwork. After? It was *theatre on ice.*\n\n---\n\n**5\/10**\nBut the backlash? Brutal. Critics called her \"unladylike.\" Other skaters boycotted. The ISU (skating\u2019s governing body) *banned women* from competing again in 1903. Madge? She *retired*\u2014but her legacy? *Unstoppable.*\n\n---\n\n**6\/10**\nFast forward: 1924. Women *finally* allowed back in championships. Guess who they credited as the reason? *Madge Syers.* A pregnant skater in 1902 had more guts than a room full of suits in 1924.\n\n---\n\n**7\/10**\nHer secret weapon? *Joy.* She skated like she was *dancing with the ice*. No fear, no apology. Just pure, unfiltered *passion*. In an era of corsets and \"proper\" women, she moved like the future.\n\n---\n\n**8\/10**\nFun fact: She was also a *champion roller skater*.

Because Madge Syers proved *rules are suggestions*\u2014especially when they\u2019re unfair. She didn\u2019t wait for permission. She *took* the ice. And she *lit it on fire.*\n\n---\n\n**10\/10**\nToday, women dominate figure skating. The sport is *art*. The ice is *theirs*. All thanks to a pregnant skater in 1902 who refused to be told no.

The color changes as time passes, from the brown color of the caterpillar to light brown. The pupa's morphology varies with both sex and generation. Female pupae are generally longer and wider than the male pupae. First generation caterpillars secrete smoother and more delicate silk, and thus the cocoon is covered with finer material. Second generation cocoons are coarser and have shreds of wood barks. That is because second generation caterpillars bore out the bark of the tree to create itself a cradle.\n\nThe fifth instar caterpillar seeks for a place to spin the cocoon near the ground. Using its spider-like silk threads, the larva lowers down to the ground from the branches. They can also crawl down the trunk of the tree. The process of searching for an appropriate place to pupate is long and selective. Pupae have been spotted in various places, such as under old bark, cracks, dry places in the earth, ditches dug into ground, storehouse with the fruit, trunk, under rocks, and between clods of soil.\n\nFor first generation caterpillars, pupation lasts a shorter period of time, usually less than ten days. For the second generation, the duration of pupation is longer at around 20 days. The difference in pupation duration between first and second generation pupae is due to temperature change as the season progresses. There is a relationship between temperature and duration of pupation: warmer temperatures have been found to shorten the duration. Therefore, first generation caterpillars, which emerge in the warmer months of summer, tend to have a shorter pupation duration. Some second generation caterpillars pupate over winter and in the spring emerge as first generation moths. The cocoon provides sufficient protection from rain and other external factors, except mechanical ones.\n\n #### Adult\n\nSecond generation adult moths first emerge in the spring, around the end of April to beginning of May in Northern Hemisphere countries (September\/October in the Southern Hemisphere). Flight time and emergence are dependent on temperature and other climatic factors. As soon as the moths emerge, they copulate, oviposit first generation eggs, and caterpillars that arise from the eggs bore into the fruits. Therefore, it is critical to predict the time of emergence of the moths in the spring to minimize damages to the crops. Segments of the moth abdomen have sharp notches that can make it easier for the moth to emerge from the cocoon. The notches can be used to cut through the exterior cover of the pupa. When the moths first eclose, or emerge as adults, their wings are not spread out completely. Thus they are not capable of flight immediately after eclosion. It takes about ten minutes for the wings to spread completely.\n\nThe average life span of the moth is around 13 to 18 days. However, the longest living male observed lived for 38 days, and the oldest female lived for 37 days.\n\n ### Diapause\n\nDiapause, or a period of suspended development, occurs in codling moth caterpillars if the climatic conditions or food availability are unfavorable. Larvae in diapause do not spin cocoons but rather enter a stage of decreased metabolism and vital activity. Once the temperature drops below 0 degrees Celsius, the caterpillar turns lifeless and becomes a blob of mush. The caterpillar becomes so soft that if poked, the place where it is poked will remain caved in, as if it is made out of heated wax or clay.\n\nFor first generation larvae, a greater percentage of the caterpillars entered diapause if they did not pupate by the end of June or beginning of July. Second generation diapause is generally to pass through the winter. Inactivity over the winter is caused by a drop in temperature, and once the temperature and humidity rise back up to a favorable range, activity is resumed. This explains how codling moths are able to survive even if a bad, sterile apple year occurs: the larvae enter diapause and emerge after the bad year has passed.\n\nThe possibility of a two-year diapause has been debated in the literature for several years. However, the possibility of two-year diapause is slim because none of the caterpillars out of 15,000 cocoons observed emerged after a diapause that lasted two years.\n\n","h_score":1770326.7937500002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":2351475,"revid":1173185765,"description":"Species of moth that feeds on fruit (Cydia pomonella)","categories":["Agricultural pest insects","Grapholitini","Insects of Iceland","Insects of Turkey","Moths described in 1758","Moths of New Zealand","Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus","Tortricidae of Europe"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\n\ud83d\udea8 *The codling moth isn\u2019t just a pest\u2014it\u2019s a tiny, furry heist artist.* While you sleep, it\u2019s burrowing into your apples, turning them into Swiss cheese.

He received nibbles of interest, including from A's owner Charlie Finley, and each later blamed the other for the failure to come to terms. The Detroit Tigers had won the World Series in 1968, but dropped below .500 two years later. Team general manager Jim Campbell felt that the team could win again with the right manager. On October 2, 1970, Campbell fired manager Mayo Smith and gave Martin a two-year deal (for 1971 and 1972) at an annual salary of \\$65,000. Martin seemed to be an odd fit for the Tigers, given their straitlaced reputation under Campbell, but the general manager felt that Martin was the spark the Tigers needed to return to contention. Martin announced that the Tigers would win the 1971 American League East title, and that the Orioles were over the hill. He made it clear that he was going to run the team his way, and his clubhouse tirades for poor play even during spring training were reported in the media and concerned Detroit management. He had a well-publicized feud with slugger Willie Horton, whom Martin repeatedly benched and who kept himself out of the lineup with an alleged injury that Martin disputed. There were repeated conflicts with umpires, and with personnel off the field: he accused the organist in Oakland of trying to distract his players, and the scoreboard operators in Baltimore of spying on his team. After a poor April, Martin's players won seven in a row to surge to within 41\u20442 games of the top-placing Red Sox near the start of June. The results helped establish Martin as one of the best managers in baseball, at least on the field. His generalship could not paper over the flaws in the ball club, and the Tigers finished second, 11 games behind the Orioles. Nevertheless, Martin led the Tigers to a 91\u201371 record, a 12-game improvement from 1970, proving to many people that his success in Minnesota had not been a fluke. Martin was rewarded with a new two-year contract, through 1973, with an increase in salary. At spring training, Martin was relaxed and confident, his Tigers a favorite to win the American League East. The season started late, due to a player's strike, and the missed games were not made up, which left the teams playing an unequal number of games. Once play started, Martin was his usual self, berating opposing managers and the umpires from the dugout, and being ejected for it in the second game of the season, against Baltimore and Weaver. This was his first ejection as Tigers manager. There was a close AL East pennant race in 1972, when the Tigers and Orioles were joined by the Yankees and Red Sox in contending for the division title. With Detroit winning, those players hostile to Martin remained silent. The season came down to a three-game set between the Tigers and Red Sox, with Boston a half game ahead.","h_score":1823790.03125,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":287341,"revid":1169838516,"description":"American baseball player and manager (1928\u20131989)","categories":["1928 births","1989 deaths","American League All-Stars","American people of Azorean descent","American people of Italian descent","Baseball coaches from California","Baseball players from Berkeley, California","Berkeley High School (Berkeley, California) alumni","Burials at Gate of Heaven Cemetery (Hawthorne, New York)","Cincinnati Reds players","Cleveland Indians players","Detroit Tigers managers","Detroit Tigers players","Kansas City Athletics players","Major League Baseball broadcasters","Major League Baseball general managers","Major League Baseball managers with retired numbers","Major League Baseball players with retired numbers","Major League Baseball second basemen","Major League Baseball third base coaches","Milwaukee Braves players","Minnesota Twins coaches","Minnesota Twins managers","Minnesota Twins players","Minnesota Twins scouts","New York Yankees announcers","New York Yankees managers","New York Yankees players","Oakland Athletics executives","Oakland Athletics managers","People from Broome County, New York","Road incident deaths in New York (state)","Texas Rangers managers","United States Army soldiers","World Series-winning managers"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nBilly Martin wasn\u2019t just a manager\u2014he was a *force of nature*.

The band had spent much of the previous year traveling and supporting their previous album Enema of the State (1999), which launched their mainstream career. The album's title is a tongue-in-cheek pun on masturbation (\"take off your pants and jack it\"), and its cover art has icons for each member of the trio: an airplane (\"take off\"), a pair of pants, and a jacket. It is the band's final release through MCA.\n\nThe album was recorded over three months at Signature Sound in San Diego with producer Jerry Finn. During the sessions, MCA executives pressured the band to retain the sound that helped their previous album sell millions . As such, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket continues the pop-punk tone that Blink-182 had honed and made famous, albeit with a heavier post-hardcore sound inspired by bands such as Fugazi and Refused. Regarding its lyrical content, it has been referred to as a concept album chronicling adolescence, with songs dedicated to first dates, fighting authority, and teenage parties. Due to differing opinions on direction, the trio worked in opposition to one another for the first time, and the sessions sometimes became contentious.\n\nThe album had near-immediate success, becoming the first punk rock record to debut at number one on the US Billboard 200 and achieving double platinum certification in May 2002. It produced three hit singles\u2014\"The Rock Show\", \"Stay Together for the Kids\", and \"First Date\"\u2014that were top-ten hits on modern rock charts. Critical impressions of the album were generally positive, commending its expansion on teenage themes, although others viewed this as its weakness. To support the album, the band co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Green Day. Take Off Your Pants and Jacket has sold over 14 million copies worldwide.\n\n","h_score":1761858.0125000002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":143261,"revid":1173356254,"description":null,"categories":["2001 albums","Albums produced by Jerry Finn","Albums recorded at EastWest Studios","Blink-182 albums","MCA Records albums"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nYour pants are a prison.

The process of paving portions of Orange Avenue began in 1893, with an estimated cost of \\$50,000 (about \\$ in dollars); three miles (4.8 km) of sidewalks were also included. The plan was to make the avenue \"one of the most beautiful in Southern California.\" From Palm City to Imperial Beach, the road was paved by 1920. The Silver Strand Highway opened in 1924 during a festival at the Tent City summer resort in Coronado, and went from Coronado to Palm City. By 1928, all streets in the city of Coronado had been paved, which was expected to encourage people to visit Tent City.\n\nPlans to transfer the Silver Strand Highway to state maintenance were in place as early as November 1931, and were to take effect once Silver Strand State Park was completed and open. In 1933, the highway from the San Diego\u2013Coronado Ferry to Route 2 (now I-5) was added to the state highway system, and was designated as Legislative Route 199 two years later. By that same year, Sign Route 75 was posted from U.S. Route 101 (US 101) in Palm City to the ferry landing. After a subsequent highway project around 1939, SR 75 passed through Tent City and, according to William Cecil, the city's public works director in 1998, \"contributed to its demise.\"\n\nThe first contract for widening the highway between Coronado and Coronado Heights was awarded in 1944, as this part of the road was \"now too narrow and dilapidated to meet traffic requirements.\" The State Highway Commission allocated \\$25,000 (about \\$ in dollars) to install traffic signals at the intersection of SR 75 and US 101 in March 1951. Plans to widen the road to four lanes were put on hold in July.\n\nBy July 1952, it had been disclosed that some local businesses near Palm City had lodged opposition to the widening of the highway after \\$500,000 (about \\$ in dollars) had been allocated to the project. Following protests from local businessmen regarding the design of the median, the planned removal of access to intersecting streets, and the planned changes to street parking, Governor Earl Warren wrote to the San Diego Public Safety Committee, hoping to have the dispute resolved. In November, funds were allocated to acquire land for the construction in the 1953\u20131954 state budget. A year later, \\$430,000 (about \\$ in dollars) had been allocated to the widening project. A contract was given to the Daley Corporation to carry out the construction in 1955. The highway was to be widened to four lanes, and would add three pedestrian crossings. The completion of the widening project was announced on August 10, 1956. The final cost of the project was \\$850,000 (about \\$ in dollars), with money from the City of Coronado and the state.\n\n","h_score":1767726.4437500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1818561,"revid":1171611173,"description":"Highway in California","categories":["Roads in San Diego County, California","Southern California freeways","State Scenic Highway System (California)","State highways in California"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"California\u2019s Hidden Highway: How Route 75 Carves Through the Desert\u2019s Heart\"**\n\n*From the palm-lined suburbs of Rancho Pe\u00f1asquitos to the sunbaked wilds of Anza-Borrego, State Route 75 is the quiet backbone of San Diego\u2019s inland escape\u2014where commuters, hikers, and coyotes share the same winding asphalt ribbon.*\n\n---\n\n### **A Scenic Backbone for the Inland Empire**\nStretching **55 miles** from I-5 near Mira Mesa to the Mexican border, Route 75 is San Diego\u2019s unsung connector\u2014a two-lane ribbon of pavement that threads through **canyon shadows, cattle ranches, and the occasional tumbleweed**.

It earned positive responses from viewers.

It passed 100 million baht\u2014a success benchmark for Thai films\u2014on 20 May, and by the end of its theatrical run on 14 June, had earned 112.15 million baht (\\$3.3 million), making it the highest-grossing Thai film of 2017. The film was released internationally throughout East and Southeast Asia, as well as in Australia and New Zealand. It placed first at Hong Kong's box office on its opening weekend, while in Taiwan and Malaysia, the film opened to limited screens but rapidly gained popularity by online word-of-mouth, also rising to the top of the box office in Taiwan. It broke records for highest-grossing Thai film in Cambodia, Taiwan, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Vietnam. The film opened in mainland China on 13 October 2017, a rare occurrence of a Thai film securing a wide release, unedited, in the country. It placed second at the Chinese box office and sixth globally (third excluding the US and Canada) during the weekend of 13\u201315 October. After seventeen days, it had earned at least \\$36.5 million, the highest gross ever of any Thai\u2014or Southeast Asian\u2014film in any overseas market. It was a huge success for Chinese distributor Hengye Pictures, who acquired the rights for flat fee of \\$3.3 million. The film earned a worldwide cumulative gross of \\$42.35 million as of 22 October, according to Comscore. Bad Genius's international success has been compared to that of several popular Thai films during the early 2000s, including Ong-Bak, whose previous overseas record was surpassed by Bad Genius soon after its China release. However, the Bangkok Post's film editor Kong Rithdee noted that Bad Genius appeared to be an isolated case, as wider government support of the creative industry was still lacking. Yongyoot Thongkongtoon, GDH's senior director of international business affairs, attributed the film's success (despite the unconventional genre for Thai cinema) to its mainstream story, as well as the region's shared competitive academic culture, which made the film relatable to a wider Asian audience. Although Yongyoot said that the studio's films catered first and foremost to the Thai audience, and that international sales were seen as a bonus, GDH CEO Jina Osothsilp later commented that the company was working to expand its presence in the international market, and that Bad Genius's success in China served as an important milestone in that mission. On the festival circuit, Bad Genius was screened as the opening feature of the 16th New York Asian Film Festival on 30 June 2017; it was the first Southeast Asian film chosen to open the event.","h_score":1819380.425,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":54407612,"revid":1167824586,"description":"2017 Thai film by Nattawut Poonpiriya","categories":["2010s heist films","2010s high school films","2017 films","Best Picture Suphannahong National Film Award winners","Films about academic scandals","Films about examinations and testing","Films about social class","Films set in Bangkok","Films set in Sydney","Films shot in Sydney","Films shot in Thailand","GDH 559 films","Thai heist films","Thai high school films","Thai national heritage films","Thai teen films","Thai thriller films","Thai-language films"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Bad Genius: The Heist Movie That Fooled Hollywood\u2014and the World\"**\n\n*How a Thai thriller became a global sensation by turning exam fraud into high-stakes cinema.*\n\n---\n\n### **A Crime So Smart, It Was Almost Real**\n*Bad Genius* (2017) isn\u2019t just a heist movie\u2014it\u2019s a masterclass in turning academic anxiety into adrenaline.

Many of these rules and procedures originated in the early years of the Republic, and were upheld over the centuries under the principle of mos maiorum (\"customs of the ancestors\"). While Senate meetings could take place either inside or outside of the formal boundary of the city (the pomerium), no meeting could take place more than a mile outside of the pomerium. Senate meetings might take place outside of the formal boundary of the city for several reasons. For example, the Senate might wish to meet with an individual, such as a foreign ambassador, whom they did not wish to allow inside the city.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, the first Senate meeting always took place at the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. Other venues could include the Temple of Fides or the Temple of Concord, or, if the meeting was outside of the formal boundary of the city, at the Temple of Apollo or (if a war meeting) at the Temple of Bellona. In addition, the Senate operated while under various religious restrictions. For example, before any meeting could begin, a sacrifice to the gods was made, and a search for divine omens (the auspices) was taken. The auspices were taken in order to determine whether that particular Senate meeting held favor with the gods. The Senate was only allowed to meet in a building of religious significance, such as the Curia Hostilia.\n\nThe ethical requirements of senators were significant. Senators could not engage in banking or any form of public contract without legal approval. They could not own a ship that was large enough to participate in foreign commerce without legal approval, and they could not leave Italy without permission from the Senate. In addition, since they were not paid, individuals usually sought to become a senator only if they were independently wealthy.\n\nThe censors were the magistrates who enforced the ethical standards of the Senate. Whenever a censor punished a senator, they had to allege some specific failing. Possible reasons for punishing a member included corruption, abuse of capital punishment, or the disregard of a colleague's veto, constitutional precedent, or the auspices. Senators who failed to obey various laws could also be punished. While punishment could include impeachment (expulsion) from the Senate, often a punishment was less severe than outright expulsion. While the standard was high for expelling a member from the Senate, it was easier to deny a citizen the right to join the Senate. Various moral failings could result in one not being allowed to join the Senate, including bankruptcy, prostitution, or a prior history of having been a gladiator. One law (the Lex repetundarum of 123 BC) made it illegal for a citizen to become a senator if they had been convicted of a criminal offense. Many of these laws were enacted in the last century of the Republic, as public corruption began reaching unprecedented levels.\n\n","h_score":1783865.5687500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":142450,"revid":1162461311,"description":"Governing and advisory assembly of the aristocracy","categories":["Government of the Roman Republic","Historical legislatures","Roman Senate"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Senate: Rome\u2019s Gladiator Pit of Power (Without the Bloodsport)\"**\n\n*Where 300 old men ruled an empire\u2014until they didn\u2019t.

Servals might be active for a longer time on cool or rainy days. During the hot midday, they rest or groom themselves in the shade of bushes and grasses. Servals remain cautious of their vicinity, though they may be less alert when no large carnivores or prey animals are around. Servals walk as much as 2 to 4 kilometres (1+1\u20444 to 2+1\u20442 miles) every night. Servals will often use special trails to reach certain hunting areas. A solitary animal, there is little social interaction among servals except in the mating season, when pairs of opposite sexes may stay together. The only long-lasting bond appears to be of the mother and her cubs, which leave their mother only when they are a year old.\n\nBoth males and females establish home ranges, and are most active only in certain regions ('core areas') within them. The area of these ranges can vary from 10 to 32 square kilometres (4 to 12 square miles); prey density, availability of cover and human interference could be significant factors in determining their size. Home ranges might overlap extensively, but occupants show minimal interaction. Aggressive encounters are rare, as servals appear to mutually avoid one another rather than fight and defend their ranges. On occasions where two adult servals meet in conflict over territory, a ritualistic display may ensue, in which one will place a paw on the other's chest while observing their rival closely; this interaction rarely escalates into a fight.\n\nAgonistic behavior involves vertical movement of the head (contrary to the horizontal movement observed in other cats), raising the hair and the tail, displaying the teeth and the white band on the ears, and yowling. Individuals mark their ranges and preferred paths by spraying urine on nearby vegetation, dropping scats along the way, and rubbing their mouths on grasses or the ground while releasing saliva. Servals tend to be sedentary, shifting only a few kilometres away even if they leave their range.\n\nThe serval is vulnerable to hyenas and African wild dogs. It will seek cover to escape its view, and, if the predator is very close, immediately flee in long leaps, changing its direction frequently and with the tail raised. The serval is an efficient, though not frequent, climber; an individual was observed to have climbed a tree to a height of more than 9 metres (30 feet) to escape dogs. Like many cats, the serval is able to purr; it also has a high-pitched chirp, and can hiss, cackle, growl, grunt, and meow.\n\n","h_score":1826236.7375,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":275223,"revid":1172523781,"description":"Small wild cat","categories":["Felids of Africa","Felines","Mammals described in 1776","Mammals of Africa","Mammals of Angola","Mammals of Botswana","Mammals of Kenya","Mammals of Namibia","Mammals of North Africa","Mammals of South Africa","Mammals of Sub-Saharan Africa","Mammals of Tanzania","Mammals of Uganda","Mammals of West Africa","Mammals of Zambia","Mammals of the Democratic Republic of the Congo","Taxa named by Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nMeet the *serval*\u2014Africa\u2019s golden acrobat. 3x the height of a housecat, built for *leaping* like a furry spring.

It was the first UEFA European Football Championship final, UEFA's top football competition for national teams. The match was contested by the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. En route to the final, the Soviet Union defeated Hungary over a two-legged tie before receiving a walkover in the quarter-final after Spain withdrew from the tournament. In the semi-final, the Soviet Union won 3\u20130 against Czechoslovakia. Yugoslavia defeated Bulgaria, Portugal and France, the host nation for the finals.\n\nThe referee for the final, played in front of 17,966 spectators in rainy conditions, was Arthur Ellis from England. Yugoslavia took the lead in the 43rd minute with a goal credited to Milan Gali\u0107 after dominating the early stages of the match. The Soviet Union equalised shortly after half-time through Slava Metreveli and the match ended 1\u20131 in regular time, meaning extra time was required to determine the outcome. Dra\u017ean Jerkovi\u0107's header was high for Yugoslavia in the first period of additional time but with seven minutes remaining, Viktor Ponedelnik scored with a header from a Valentin Ivanov cross to give the Soviet Union a 2\u20131 victory.\n\nYugoslavia went on to qualify for the 1962 FIFA World Cup where they finished second in Group 1 behind the Soviet Union against whom they had lost 2\u20130, before defeating West Germany in the quarter-final. They were knocked out in the semi-final by Czechoslovakia and lost to Chile, who had beaten the Soviet Union in the quarter-final, in the third place play-off.\n\n ## Background\n\nThe 1960 European Nations' Cup was the first edition of the UEFA European Football Championship, UEFA's football competition for national teams. Opening rounds were played on a home-and-away basis before the semi-finals and final taking place in France, between 6 and 10 July 1960. A third-place play-off match took place the day before the final.\n\nThe Soviet Union had made their international football tournament debut in the 1958 FIFA World Cup where they were beaten 2\u20130 at the quarter-final stage by hosts Sweden. Yugoslavia also played at the World Cup two years before and had similarly been knocked out in the quarter-finals, by West Germany. The last meeting between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia was in the 1956 Summer Olympics where the Soviet Union won 1\u20130 in the final.\n\n ## Road to the final\n\n","h_score":1795384.7750000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":18210590,"revid":1168382309,"description":"Association football match","categories":["1960 European Nations' Cup","1960 in Paris","International association football competitions hosted by Paris","July 1960 sports events in Europe","Soviet Union at the 1960 European Nations' Cup","Soviet Union national football team matches","Soviet Union\u2013Yugoslavia relations","UEFA European Championship finals","Yugoslavia at the 1960 European Nations' Cup","Yugoslavia national football team matches"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nThe 1960 European Nations\u2019 Cup final was the first-ever UEFA European Championship.

This precluded both Aquitaine and Ireland, where he had spent previous exiles. There is some evidence that he might have gone to France initially, but considering the French king's hostile attitude towards him, he is not likely to have stayed there long. Flanders is a much more likely candidate for Gaveston's third and final exile. This time his absence was even shorter than the second time, lasting no more than two months. Returning around Christmas 1311, he was reunited with the King early in 1312, probably at Knaresborough on 13 January. The reason for his quick return might have been the birth of his child, a daughter named Joan, around this time. On 18 January, Edward declared the judgement against Gaveston unlawful, and restored all lands to him. The royal and baronial parties now both began preparations for war. In March, Gaveston settled at Scarborough, and began to fortify the castle. Around the same time, he was pronounced excommunicated by Archbishop Winchelsey at St Paul's. At the same meeting the barons \u2013 under the leadership of Lancaster \u2013 divided up the realm to oppose the King. Pembroke and Warenne were given the responsibility of capturing Gaveston. On 4 May, the King and Gaveston were at Newcastle, and barely escaped a force led by Lancaster, Henry Percy and Robert Clifford. Gaveston then returned to Scarborough, while the King left for York. Scarborough was soon besieged by Pembroke, Warenne, Percy and Clifford, and on 19 May Gaveston surrendered to the besiegers. The terms of the surrender were that Pembroke, Warenne and Percy would take Gaveston to York, where the barons would negotiate with the king. If an agreement could not be reached by 1 August, Gaveston would be allowed to return to Scarborough. The three swore an oath to guarantee his safety. After an initial meeting with the King in York, Gaveston was left in the custody of Pembroke, who escorted him south for safekeeping. On 9 June, Pembroke left to visit his wife, leaving Gaveston at the rectory at Deddington in Oxfordshire. When Warwick found out about Gaveston's whereabouts, he immediately rode out to capture him. The next morning he appeared at the rectory, where he took Gaveston captive and brought him back to his castle at Warwick. Pembroke, whose honour had been affronted, appealed for justice both to Gaveston's brother-in-law Gloucester and to the University of Oxford, but to no avail. At Warwick, Gaveston was condemned to death for violating the terms of the Ordinances before an assembly of barons, including Warwick, Lancaster, Hereford and Arundel. On 19 June, he was taken out on the road towards Kenilworth as far as Blacklow Hill, which was on the Earl of Lancaster's land. Here, two Welshmen ran him through with a sword and beheaded him.","h_score":1767597.6062500002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":125137,"revid":1167967854,"description":"Favourite of Edward II (c. 1284 \u2013 1312)","categories":["1280s births","1312 deaths","14th-century English people","14th-century assassinated people","Assassinated English politicians","British and English royal favourites","Earls of Cornwall","Edward II of England","English knights","English landowners","English murder victims","Holders of the Honour of Wallingford","Lords Lieutenant of Ireland","Medieval Cornish people","Medieval murder victims","People knighted at the Feast of the Swans","People murdered in England"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Piers Gaveston: The Favourite Who Divided a Kingdom\"**\n\n*King Edward II\u2019s controversial lover and ally rose to power\u2014and sparked a rebellion that reshaped medieval England.

As the eldest son of Safi and his Circassian wife, Anna Khanum, he inherited the throne when he was nine, and had to rely on a regency led by Saru Taqi, the erstwhile grand vizier of his father, to govern in his place. During the regency, Abbas received formal kingly education that until then, he had been denied. In 1645, at age fifteen, he was able to remove Saru Taqi from power, and after purging the bureaucracy ranks, asserted his authority over his court and began his absolute rule. Abbas II's reign was marked by peacefulness and progression. He intentionally avoided a war with the Ottoman Empire, and his relations with the Uzbeks in the east were friendly. He enhanced his reputation as a military commander by leading his army during the war with the Mughal Empire, and successfully recovering the city of Kandahar. On his behest, Rostom Khan, the King of Kartli and the Safavid vassal, invaded the Kingdom of Kakheti in 1648 and sent the rebellious monarch Teimuraz I into exile; in 1651, Teimuraz tried to reclaim his lost crown with the support of the Russia Tsardom, but the Russians were defeated by Abbas' army in a short conflict fought between 1651 and 1653; the war's major event was the destruction of the Russian fortress in the Iranian side of the Terek river. Abbas also suppressed a rebellion led by the Georgians between 1659 and 1660, in which he acknowledged Vakhtang V as the king of Kartli, but had the rebel leaders executed. From the middle years of his reign onwards, Abbas was occupied with a financial decline that plagued the realm until the end of the Safavid dynasty. In order to increase revenues, in 1654 Abbas appointed Mohammad Beg, a distinguished economist. However, he was unable to overcome the economic decline. Mohammad Beg's efforts often damaged the treasury. He took bribes from the Dutch East India Company and assigned his family members into various positions. In 1661, Mohammad Beg was replaced by Mirza Mohammad Karaki, a weak and inactive administrator. He was excluded from the shah's business in the inner palace, to the point that he was ignorant to the existence of Sam Mirza, the future Suleiman and the next Safavid shah of Iran. Abbas II died on 25 September 1666, aged thirty-four. Described by modern historians as the last strong king of the Safavid dynasty, he stood out from his father and his successors by being persistently concerned for state affairs. A king known for his sense of justice, Western historians and observers often portrayed him as a magnanimous and tolerant monarch who ruled a kingdom free of rebellions and relatively safe to travel within. Some historians have criticised him for acts of cruelty similar to his father and forcing conversion upon the Iranian Jews, but most have noted his tolerance towards Christians. Commentators after the fall of the Safavid dynasty in 1722, remember him as a forceful ruler who temporarily reversed the decline of the Safavid state to create a period of prosperity, stability and peace, that with his death, ended once and for all.","h_score":1824997.1125,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":6039552,"revid":1171535109,"description":"Safavid Shah of Iran (1632\u20131666) (r. 1642-1666)","categories":["1632 births","1666 deaths","17th-century Iranian people","17th-century monarchs of Persia","Azerbaijani-language poets","Burials at Fatima Masumeh Shrine","Iranian people of Circassian descent","Iranian slave owners","People of the Russo-Persian Wars","Safavid monarchs"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nA king who ruled from a *throne of gold* but lost his empire to a *boy with a rifle*.

Over his 30-year career, he was involved in the development of five computers of great historical significance. With Freddie Williams he worked on the Williams\u2013Kilburn tube and the world's first electronic stored-program computer, the Manchester Baby, while working at the University of Manchester. His work propelled Manchester and Britain into the forefront of the emerging field of computer science.\n\nA graduate of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, Kilburn worked on radar at the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) in Malvern under Frederic Calland Williams during the Second World War. After the war ended, he was recruited by Williams to work on the development of computers at the University of Manchester. He led the development of a succession of innovative Manchester computers that incorporated a host of ground-breaking innovations and developments, including the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercial computer, and the Atlas, one of the first time-sharing multiprocessing computers that incorporated job scheduling, spooling, interrupts, instruction pipelining and paging.\n\n ## Early life and education\n\nTom Kilburn was born in Earlseaton near Dewsbury, Yorkshire, on 11 August 1921, the only son of John William Kilburn, a wool mill clerk who later became a company secretary, and his wife, Ivy Mortimer. From 1932 to 1940, he attended the Wheelwright Grammar School for Boys, where the headmaster encouraged his aptitude for mathematics. He also played sports, notably running.\n\nIn 1940, Kilburn entered Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, with a state scholarship, a county major scholarship, and a minor open scholarship, where he studied mathematics. Although many university dons were absent performing war work at places like Bletchley Park, the University of Cambridge maintained a vigorous mathematical community, and Kilburn became the Sidney Sussex College representative in the New Pythagoreans, a clique with the Cambridge University Mathematical Society that also numbered Gordon Welchman and Geoff Tootill among its members. Due to the outbreak of the Second World War, courses were compressed to two years, and he graduated in 1942 with First Class Honours in Part I of the Mathematical Tripos and preliminary examinations for Part II.\n\n","h_score":1856615.375,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":766938,"revid":1173494311,"description":"British electrical engineer","categories":["1921 births","2001 deaths","Alumni of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge","Alumni of the Victoria University of Manchester","British computer scientists","Commanders of the Order of the British Empire","English electrical engineers","Fellows of the British Computer Society","Fellows of the Royal Society","History of computing in the United Kingdom","People associated with the Department of Computer Science, University of Manchester","People from Dewsbury","Royal Medal winners"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Tom Kilburn: The Unsung Pioneer Who Built the First Modern Computer\"**\n\n*Without his work, the digital age might never have arrived.

The latter stated in January 1974 that it was \"extremely questionable whether the Norwich and Worcester has demonstrated the ability to provide even minimal service to eastern Connecticut\". The USRA found the arguments of the Providence and Worcester and its supporters that it was in a better position to take over the line on account of its years of profitable operations persuasive, and transferred it to the railroad later that year. The remaining 27 miles (43 km) of the N&W went to Conrail, but the Providence and Worcester was not satisfied with its share of the line and sought to acquire the rest of the line from the newly formed railroad. Conrail initially was unprofitable, and in 1976 the Providence and Worcester approached the company with an offer to buy its 27-mile line between Plainfield and Groton. Conrail was unwilling to give up the line, which was one of its most profitable in the state, leading the Connecticut Department of Transportation to request that the federal government order the line transferred that year. The following year, Conrail was forced to sell the line, due to the law that established the company requiring it to sell lines to any private companies offering a fair price. Despite this, Conrail continued to operate the line while debate continued between the two railroads over what constituted a \"fair price\" \u2013 Conrail wanted over \\$3 million, while the Providence and Worcester offered under \\$1 million. Finally, on May 20, 1980, a federal court announced it was ordering Conrail to sell the line to the P&W for \\$1.75 million, which the three justices on the court decided was a fair price. ### 1980s\n\nAs P&W expanded its network, the company spent heavily to improve the condition of lines it purchased, many of which had been poorly maintained by previous owners. The repairs were partially funded by the federal government and by the states served by P&W.\n\nIn 1982, the Providence and Worcester acquired all of Conrail's lines in Rhode Island, along with some in Connecticut. While P&W wanted all 530 miles (850 km) of Conrail's lines in Southern New England, it had to compete with the Boston & Maine, at the time in the sights of newly formed Guilford Transportation Industries, which bought portions of Conrail's network in Connecticut. The Providence and Worcester objected to allowing Guilford to form a major railroad network in New England, to no avail. The P&W also purchased two shortline railroads in Rhode Island between 1981 and 1982: the Moshassuck Valley Railroad and the Warwick Railway.\n\nIn December 1987, P&W owner Capital Properties Inc. of Providence, announced it was divesting the railroad, with Capital's shareholders each getting 2 shares of the railroad's stock per share of Capital stock.\n\n ### 1990s\n\nThe Providence and Worcester further expanded into Connecticut in 1993, when it purchased Conrail's line between Cedar Hill Yard in North Haven and Middletown. Between November 1993 and June 1994, the railroad improved the line in cooperation with the Connecticut Department of Transportation, replacing more than 5,000 ties and 7,000 feet (2,100 m) of rail in a \\$650,000 project. After the project was complete, its speed limit increased from 10 to 25 miles per hour. The increased speed and frequency of trains concerned some residents along the line, who advocated for the installation of gates and lights at railroad crossings for safety. P&W bought the Middletown-based shortline Connecticut Central Railroad in 1998, adding a cluster of branch lines in that city to its network.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, P&W traffic decreased when a number of its major customers closed or moved. In response, the company expanded interchange traffic with other railroads. The company reached an agreement in 1996 for trackage rights over the Northeast Corridor between New Haven and the New York and Atlantic Railway's Fresh Pond Junction yard in Queens, New York. The Providence and Worcester uses the tracks to haul stone between its connection with the Branford Steam Railroad and New York City.\n\n","h_score":1773455.2625000002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1376980,"revid":1168881032,"description":"Regional railroad in the Northeastern United States","categories":["2016 mergers and acquisitions","Companies affiliated with the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad","Connecticut railroads","Genesee & Wyoming","Massachusetts railroads","New York (state) railroads","Providence and Worcester Railroad","Railway companies established in 1844","Regional railroads in the United States","Rhode Island railroads"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Iron Horse to Ghost Tracks: The Providence & Worcester\u2019s Last Ride\"**\n\n*From steam-age lifeline to overgrown relic, this railroad\u2019s 150-year saga mirrors America\u2019s love affair with progress\u2014and its regrets.*\n\n---\n\n**A Railroad Born of Fire and Fortune**\nThe Providence & Worcester (P&W) wasn\u2019t just tracks\u2014it was a *gamble*.

In addition to Reagan, the major candidates were George H. W. Bush, John Anderson, Howard Baker, John Connally, and Bob Dole. There was speculation about the potential candidacy of former President Gerald Ford, but he declined to run against Reagan. In an upset defeat in the Iowa caucus held on January 21, Reagan narrowly lost to Bush. After the win, Bush said his campaign was full of momentum, or \"the Big Mo\", and they would perform even better in the New Hampshire primary. Three days before the New Hampshire primary, the Reagan and Bush campaigns agreed to a one-on-one debate sponsored by The Telegraph at Nashua, New Hampshire, but hours before the debate, the Reagan campaign invited other candidates including Dole, Anderson, Baker and Phil Crane. Debate moderator Jon Breen denied seats to the other candidates, asserting that The Telegraph would violate federal campaign contribution laws if it sponsored the debate and changed the ground rules hours before the debate. As a result, the Reagan campaign agreed to pay for the debate. Reagan said that as he was funding the debate, he could decide who would debate. During the debate, when Breen was laying out the ground rules and attempting to ask the first question, Reagan interrupted in protest to make an introductory statement and wanted other candidates to be included before the debate began. The moderator asked Bob Malloy, the volume operator, to mute Reagan's microphone. After Malloy repeated his demand to Malloy, Reagan furiously replied, \"I am paying for this microphone, Mr. Green! [sic]\". This turned out to be the turning point of the debate and the primary race. Ultimately, the four additional candidates left, and the debate continued between Reagan and Bush. Reagan's polling numbers improved, and he won the New Hampshire primary by more than 39,000 votes. Bush defeated Anderson and won the Massachusetts primary with a margin of 0.34 percent, although both received equal numbers of delegates. With the South Carolina primary approaching, political operative Lee Atwater leaked a story to Lee Bandy, a writer for The State newspaper that John Connally had tried to buy the black vote, which nearly destroyed Conally's campaign. Reagan swept to victory in South Carolina, defeating Connally by 14 percent. The next day, Connally formally withdrew from the campaign and endorsed Reagan. With the Illinois primary approaching, the League of Women Voters sponsored a debate between Reagan, Bush, Anderson, and Crane. The candidates criticized Anderson for signing a fund-raising letterseeking supports for liberal Democratic senators, and Reagan questioned whether Anderson was really running as a Republican. Reagan won the Illinois primary with 48 percent of the votes to Anderson's 37 percent. Reagan continued to win many other primaries and caucuses, although Bush won states like Connecticut, Maine, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. After the Pennsylvania primary, Anderson withdrew from the Republican race and re-entered the race as an independent candidate. On May 20, 1980, after the Michigan and Oregon primaries, Reagan secured enough delegates to clinch the nomination for the Republican Party. Reagan said he would always be grateful to the people of Iowa for giving him \"the kick in the pants\" he needed. On May 26, Bush; Reagan's remaining opponent for the Republican nomination conceded defeat and urged his supporters to support Reagan. On June 3 (Super Tuesday), Reagan won all nine primaries. With the end of the primaries, Reagan had won 59.8 percent votes to Bush's 23.8 percent and Anderson's 12.2 percent.","h_score":1814866.8375000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":21366577,"revid":1170861772,"description":"1980 presidential campaign of Ronald Reagan","categories":["1980 United States presidential campaigns","Articles containing video clips","George H.

After being voted on by the Jewish Agency for Israel Executive in 1944, it became the official policy of the Zionist leadership. Implementation of a significant part of the One Million Plan took place following the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.\n\nWhen the extent of the decimation of Jews in the Holocaust became known in 1944, the Biltmore Conference ambition of two million immigrants was revised downwards, and the plan was revised to include, for the first time, Jews from the Middle East and North Africa as a single category within the target of an immigration plan. In 1944\u201345, Ben-Gurion described the plan to foreign officials as being the \"primary goal and top priority of the Zionist movement.\"\n\nThe ongoing immigration restrictions of the British White Paper of 1939 meant that such a plan was not able to be put into immediate effect. Upon the establishment of Israel, Ben Gurion's government presented the Knesset with a new plan - to double the population of 600,000 within 4 years. Israeli historian Devorah Hacohen describes the opposition against this immigration policy within the new Israeli government, such as those who argued that there was \"no justification for organizing large-scale emigration among Jews whose lives were not in danger, particularly when the desire and motivation were not their own\" as well as those who argued that the absorption process caused \"undue hardship\". However, the force of Ben-Gurion's influence and insistence ensured that unrestricted immigration continued. The plan has been described as \"a pivotal event in \u2018imagining\u2019 the Jewish state\" and \"the moment when the category of Mizrahi Jews in the current sense of this term, as an ethnic group distinct from European-born Jews, was invented.\" The large scale immigration in the first few years after Israel's declaration was the product of this policy change in favour of mass immigration focused on Jews from Arab and Muslim countries.\n\n ## Background\n\nAt the 1942 Biltmore Conference, Ben-Gurion promoted the idea of two million Jews emigrating to Palestine in order to build the Jewish majority required to create the Jewish Commonwealth called for at the conference. It was assumed at the time that most of the immigrants would be Ashkenazi Jews. Ben-Gurion described his intentions to a meeting of experts and Jewish leaders:\n\n> Our Zionist policy must now pay special attention to the Jewish population groups in the Arab countries. If there are diasporas that it is our obligation to eliminate with the greatest possible urgency by bringing those Jews to the homeland, it is the Arab diasporas: Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, and North Africa, as well as the Jews of Persia and Turkey. What European Jewry is now experiencing obliges us to be especially anxious about the fate of the diasporas in the Middle East. Those Jewish groups are the hostages of Zionism... Our first move with a view toward coming events is immigration. But the paths of immigration from Europe are desolate now. The [doors] are shut tight, and there are very few countries that have a land link to the Land of Israel \u2013 the neighboring countries. All these considerations are cause for anxiety and for special activity to move the Jews in the Arab countries to the land of Israel speedily. It is a mark of great failure by Zionism that we have not yet eliminated the Yemen exile [diaspora]. If we do not eliminate the Iraq exile by Zionist means, there is a danger that it will be eliminated by Hitlerite means.\n\n","h_score":1847253.1500000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":42800429,"revid":1165837992,"description":"Strategic plan detailing the methods of Jewish return to British Mandatory Palestine post-Holocaust","categories":["1944 in Mandatory Palestine","20th-century Judaism","Action plans","Aliyah","History of the Jews in the Middle East","Immigration to Israel","Jewish Agency for Israel","June 1944 events","Mandatory Palestine in World War II"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"One Million Plan: The Wild, Weird, and Wonderful Race to Save the World (One Person at a Time)\"**\n\n*Deck:* A radical new movement is betting that 1 million tiny, personal revolutions\u2014from composting to coding\u2014can outpace global crises.

The ice cores were drilled with the help of a solar-powered ice drill specifically developed for Quelccaya because other power sources could not be brought onto the ice cap.

Dust layers deposited during the dry season allow the determination of yearly layers, which characteristically thin downward. Volcanic ash deposited by the 1600 Huaynaputina eruption has been used to date the ice cores; in turn the volume of the eruption was reconstructed from the ash thickness in the ice core. A number of research findings have been made with the Quelccaya ice cores: - The ice cores contain annually resolved oxygen isotope ratio variations. During the past millennium, the oxygen isotope ratios recorded at Quelccaya have resembled these found in other tropical South American and also Tibetan ice cores. While originally proposed to reflect temperature variations, the oxygen isotope ratios have also been assumed to reflect atmospheric circulation and temperatures in the Pacific Ocean and tropical North Atlantic. - Oxygen isotope ratio variations record the Little Ice Age, which clearly stands out in the Quelccaya ice core record. The Quelccaya record was used to infer that the Little Ice Age was a global event, and that temperature and precipitation variations took place during the Little Ice Age. An early wet phase occurred between 1500 and 1720 and a late dry phase between 1720 and 1880. At the ice cap, the Little Ice Age ended relatively suddenly around 1880. - The oxygen isotope ratios also vary during El Ni\u00f1o years and the ice cores have been employed to make a record of ENSO events. The 1976 and the 1982\u20131983 El Ni\u00f1o events have been identified in the ice cores. - A correlation between precipitation on the ice cap with water levels in Lake Titicaca and traces of the severe drought between 1933 and 1945 have been found in the ice core record of Quelccaya. - Other climate events recorded at Quelccaya are the 1815 eruption of Indonesia's Mount Tambora and the 536 climate downturn. - Additional findings in the ice cores are dust clouds generated by earthquakes in the dry Atacama and Pacific coast of Peru, dust correlated to droughts, traces of the Suess cycle which is a solar cycle, evidence of Inka and Spanish industrial activity in South America, and finally of agriculture around Lake Titicaca. The Quelccaya ice cores are widely used to reconstruct past climate states. Quelccaya was the first ice cap outside of the polar regions from which old ice cores were obtained, and is the site of the first annually resolved ice core record from the tropical Andes; it demonstrated the usefulness of tropical ice for ice core studies and the taking of these cores has been called a \"major step\" in the sampling of high elevation ice in the world. Quelccaya was selected as a site for extra-polar ice core research as it is located in the sparsely investigated tropics and lies at a higher elevation than Puncak Jaya in Indonesia or the Rwenzori Mountains in Africa; thus the ice is less disturbed by percolating meltwater. Because of the lack of seasonal temperature variations and of synoptic weather patterns, tropical glaciers may primarily record secular climate change. The dome-like shape and the low elevation range of the Quelccaya Ice Cap result in large responses of ice extent to relatively small changes in the equilibrium line altitude.","h_score":1756793.6187500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":61710465,"revid":1172181401,"description":"Glacier in Peru","categories":["Glaciers of Peru","Ice caps"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"1\/10\nThe Quelccaya Ice Cap is the largest tropical glacier on Earth.

These lectures were transcribed and published as Feynman (1985), QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter, a classic non-mathematical exposition of QED from the point of view articulated below. The key components of Feynman's presentation of QED are three basic actions. A photon goes from one place and time to another place and time. An electron goes from one place and time to another place and time. An electron emits or absorbs a photon at a certain place and time. These actions are represented in the form of visual shorthand by the three basic elements of Feynman diagrams: a wavy line for the photon, a straight line for the electron and a junction of two straight lines and a wavy one for a vertex representing emission or absorption of a photon by an electron. These can all be seen in the adjacent diagram. As well as the visual shorthand for the actions, Feynman introduces another kind of shorthand for the numerical quantities called probability amplitudes. The probability is the square of the absolute value of total probability amplitude, $\\text{probability} = | f(\\text{amplitude}) |^2$. If a photon moves from one place and time $A$ to another place and time $B$, the associated quantity is written in Feynman's shorthand as $P(A \\text{ to } B)$, and it depends on only the momentum and polarization of the photon. The similar quantity for an electron moving from $C$ to $D$ is written $E(C \\text{ to } D)$. It depends on the momentum and polarization of the electron, in addition to a constant Feynman calls n, sometimes called the \"bare\" mass of the electron: it is related to, but not the same as, the measured electron mass. Finally, the quantity that tells us about the probability amplitude for an electron to emit or absorb a photon Feynman calls j, and is sometimes called the \"bare\" charge of the electron: it is a constant, and is related to, but not the same as, the measured electron charge e. QED is based on the assumption that complex interactions of many electrons and photons can be represented by fitting together a suitable collection of the above three building blocks and then using the probability amplitudes to calculate the probability of any such complex interaction. It turns out that the basic idea of QED can be communicated while assuming that the square of the total of the probability amplitudes mentioned above (P(A to B), E(C to D) and j) acts just like our everyday probability (a simplification made in Feynman's book). Later on, this will be corrected to include specifically quantum-style mathematics, following Feynman. The basic rules of probability amplitudes that will be used are: The indistinguishability criterion in (a) is very important: it means that there is no observable feature present in the given system that in any way \"reveals\" which alternative is taken. In such a case, one cannot observe which alternative actually takes place without changing the experimental setup in some way (e.g. by introducing a new apparatus into the system). Whenever one is able to observe which alternative takes place, one always finds that the probability of the event is the sum of the probabilities of the alternatives. Indeed, if this were not the case, the very term \"alternatives\" to describe these processes would be inappropriate. What (a) says is that once the physical means for observing which alternative occurred is removed, one cannot still say that the event is occurring through \"exactly one of the alternatives\" in the sense of adding probabilities; one must add the amplitudes instead. Similarly, the independence criterion in (b) is very important: it only applies to processes which are not \"entangled\".","h_score":1847885.9875,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":25268,"revid":1170977985,"description":"Quantum field theory of electromagnetism","categories":["Freeman Dyson","Quantum electrodynamics","Quantum electronics","Quantum field theory"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Quantum Electrodynamics: The Theory Shaping Modern Physics\"**\n\n*How a 70-year-old framework explains everything from light to lasers\u2014and why it still baffles scientists.*\n\n---\n\n### **What Is Quantum Electrodynamics?**\nQuantum electrodynamics (QED) is the physics theory describing how light and matter interact at the smallest scales.

Concern is mostly related to its estrogen-like activity, although it can interact with other receptor systems as an endocrine-disrupting chemical. These interactions are all very weak, but exposure to BPA is effectively lifelong, leading to concern over possible cumulative effects. Studying this sort of long\u2010term, low\u2010dose interaction is difficult, and although there have been numerous studies, there are considerable discrepancies in their conclusions regarding the nature of the effects observed as well as the levels at which they occur. A common criticism is that industry-sponsored trials tend to show BPA as being safer than studies performed by academic or government laboratories, although this has also been explained in terms of industry studies being better designed.\n\nPublic health agencies in the EU, US, Canada, Australia and Japan as well as the WHO have all reviewed the health risks of BPA, and found normal exposure to be below the level currently associated with risk. Regardless, due to the scientific uncertainty, many jurisdictions have taken steps to reduce exposure on a precautionary basis. In particular, infants are considered to be at greater risk, leading to bans on the use of BPA in baby bottles and related products by the US, Canada, and EU amongst others. Bottle producers have largely switched from polycarbonate to polypropylene and there is some evidence that BPA exposure in infants has decreased as a result of this.

Indigenous to Mexico and Central America, the poinsettia was first described by Europeans in 1834. It is particularly well known for its red and green foliage and is widely used in Christmas floral displays. It derives its common English name from Joel Roberts Poinsett, the first United States minister to Mexico, who is credited with introducing the plant to the US in the 1820s. Poinsettias are shrubs or small trees, with heights of 0.6 to 4 m (2.0 to 13.1 ft). Though often stated to be highly toxic, the poinsettia is not dangerous to pets or children. Exposure to the plant, even consumption, most often results in no effect, though it can cause nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.\n\nWild poinsettias occur from Mexico to southern Guatemala, growing on mid-elevation, Pacific-facing slopes. One population in the Mexican state of Guerrero is much further inland, however, and is thought to be the ancestor of most cultivated populations. Wild poinsettia populations are highly fragmented, as their habitat is experiencing largely unregulated deforestation. They were cultivated by the Aztecs for use in traditional medicine. They became associated with the Christmas holiday and are popular seasonal decorations. Every year in the United States, approximately 70 million poinsettias of many cultivated varieties are sold in a six-week period. Many of these poinsettias are grown by Paul Ecke Ranch, which serves half the worldwide market and 70 percent of the US market.\n\n ## Taxonomy\n\nThe poinsettia was described as a new species in 1834 by German scientist Johann Friedrich Klotzsch. Klotzsch credited Carl Ludwig Willdenow with the species name \"pulcherrima\", and the authority is given as Willd. ex Klotzsch. The holotype had been collected in Mexico during an 1803\u20131804 expedition by Alexander von Humboldt and Aim\u00e9 Bonpland.\n\nIt was known by the common name \"poinsettia\" as early as 1836, derived from Joel Roberts Poinsett, a botanist and the first US Minister to Mexico. Possibly as early as 1826, Poinsett began sending poinsettias from Mexico back to his greenhouses in South Carolina. Prior to poinsettia, it was known as \"Mexican flame flower\" or \"painted leaf\".\n\n ## Description\n\nEuphorbia pulcherrima is a shrub or small tree, typically reaching a height of 0.6\u20134 metres (2\u201313 ft). The plant bears dark green dentate leaves that measure 7\u201316 centimetres (2.8\u20136.3 in) in length. The colored bracts\u2014which are normally flaming red, with cultivars being orange, pale green, cream, pink, white, or marbled\u2014are often mistaken for flower petals because of their groupings and colors, but are actually leaves. The colors of the bracts are created through photoperiodism, meaning that they require darkness (at least fourteen hours at a time for 6\u20138 weeks in a row) to change color. The plants also require abundant light during the day for the brightest color. Semi-evergreen, they generally lose most of their leaves during winter.\n\nThe flowers of the poinsettia are unassuming. They are grouped within the cyathia (small yellow structures found in the center of each leaf bunch, or false flowers). Nothing is known about pollination in wild poinsettias, though wasps are noted to occasionally visit the cyathia. All flowers in the Euphorbiaceae are unisexual (either male or female only), and they are often very small in size. In Euphorbia, the flowers are reduced even more and then aggregated into an inflorescence or cluster of flowers.\n\n ## Chemical composition\n\nPulcherrol and pulcherryl acetate are among the components of latex. Triterpenes are found in aerial part of this plant including latex and leaves. One of the triterpenoid skeleton is investigated as foundation to drugs for Alzheimer's disease.\n\n","h_score":1937145.3562500002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":143540,"revid":1170832288,"description":"Species of flowering plant in the spurge family Euphorbiaceae","categories":["Christian folklore","Christmas plants","Euphorbia","Flora of Central Mexico","Mexican folklore","Mexican legends"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Red Menace: How a Weedy Wildflower Conquered Christmas\"**\n\n*From Mexican shrub to holiday superstar, the poinsettia\u2019s rise is a tale of botanic espionage, corporate hustle, and a color that lies.*\n\n---\n\n### **The Accidental Icon**\nThe poinsettia (*Euphorbia pulcherrima*) wasn\u2019t always a Christmas darling\u2014it was a Mexican weed with a flair for drama.

Kaloyan became the sole ruler of Bulgaria after Theodor-Peter was murdered in 1197. Shortly afterwards he attacked the Byzantine province of Thrace and launched frequent raids against it during the following months. Around this time, he sent a letter to Pope Innocent III, urging him to dispatch an envoy to Bulgaria. He wanted to persuade the pope to acknowledge his rule in Bulgaria. Innocent eagerly entered into correspondence with Kaloyan because the reunification of the Christian denominations under his authority was one of his principal objectives. The Byzantine Emperor Alexios III Angelos made Ivanko the commander of Philippopolis (now Plovdiv in Bulgaria). Ivanko seized two fortresses in the Rhodopi Mountains from Kaloyan, but by 1198 he had made an alliance with him. Cumans and Vlachs from the lands to the north of the river Danube broke into the Byzantine Empire in the spring and autumn of 1199. Choniates, who recorded these events, did not mention that Kaloyan cooperated with the invaders, so it is likely that they crossed Bulgaria without his authorization. Kaloyan captured Brani\u010devo, Velbuzhd (now Kyustendil in Bulgaria), Skopje and Prizren from the Byzantines, most probably in that year, according to historian Alexandru Madgearu. Innocent III's envoy arrived in Bulgaria in late December 1199, bringing a letter from the Pope to Kaloyan. Innocent stated that he was informed that Kaloyan's forefathers had come \"from the City of Rome\". Kaloyan's answer, written in Old Church Slavonic, has not been preserved, but its content can be reconstructed based on his later correspondence with the Holy See. Kaloyan styled himself \"Emperor of the Bulgarians and Vlachs\", and asserted that he was the legitimate successor of the rulers of the First Bulgarian Empire. He demanded an imperial crown from the Pope and expressed his wish to put the Bulgarian Orthodox Church under the pope's jurisdiction. The Byzantines captured Ivanko and occupied his lands in 1200. Kaloyan and his Cuman allies launched a new campaign against Byzantine territories in March 1201. He destroyed Constantia (now Simeonovgrad in Bulgaria) and captured Varna. He also supported the rebellion of Dobromir Chrysos and Manuel Kamytzes against Alexios III, but they were both defeated. Roman Mstislavich, prince of Halych and Volhynia, invaded the Cumans' territories, forcing them to return to their homeland in 1201. After the Cuman's retreat, Kaloyan concluded a peace treaty with Alexios III and withdrew his troops from Thrace in late 1201 or in 1202. According to Kaloyan's letter to the Pope, Alexios III was also willing to send an imperial crown to him and to acknowledge the autocephalous (or autonomous) status of the Bulgarian Church.","h_score":1890425.3875000002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":289907,"revid":1167290510,"description":"Emperor of Bulgaria from 1196 to 1207","categories":["1207 deaths","12th-century Bulgarian tsars","13th-century Bulgarian tsars","13th-century murdered monarchs","Asen dynasty","Bulgarian people of the Byzantine\u2013Bulgarian Wars","Christians of the Fourth Crusade","Eastern Orthodox monarchs","Murdered Bulgarian monarchs"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\n\ud83d\udd25 *Meet Kaloyan the Terrible*\u2014Bulgaria\u2019s 13th-century warlord who made the Byzantine Empire *sweat*.

Ruled from 1197\u20131207, turning Bulgaria into a thorn in Constantinople\u2019s side. Think: *Vikings* meets *Game of Thrones*, but with more plunder.\n\n**3\/10**\n\ud83d\udc80 *The \"Terrible\" Nickname*. Earned it by sacking Thessaloniki (Byzantium\u2019s 2nd city) in 1185.

So feared, Byzantine chroniclers called them \"devils with human faces.\" *Chef\u2019s kiss* for intimidation.\n\n**4\/10**\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f *Tactical Genius*. Kaloyan didn\u2019t just rage\u2014he *outmaneuvered*. Tricked the Byzantines into splitting their forces, then crushed them piecemeal. Used guerrilla tactics in the Balkans like a medieval Sun Tzu. The Romans had *legions*; he had *chaos theory*.\n\n**5\/10**\n\ud83d\udc51 *The Crown of Thorns*. Legend says he wore a crown made of enemy skulls (because subtlety was for losers). Others claim it was just a fancy gold diadem. Either way, the message was clear: *Mess with Bulgaria? Bad idea.*\n\n**6\/10**\n\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f *Diplomatic Ninja*.

His own boyars (noblemen) stabbed him in the back\u2014literally\u2014in 1207. Died mid-battle, face-down in the mud. Last words? Unknown. Probably something like *\"I\u2019ll haunt you all.\"* Spoiler: He did. His legend never died.\n\n**8\/10**\n\ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f *Legacy: The \"Second Bulgaria\"*.

Kaloyan\u2019s life was pure medieval drama: betrayal, bloodshed, cunning, and a body count that\u2019d make a warlord blush. He\u2019s the reason \"Bulgarian\" became synonymous with *fierce* in the Middle Ages.\n\n**10\/10**\n\ud83d\udca5 *Final Verdict*: Kaloyan wasn\u2019t just a king\u2014he was a *force of nature*. A man who turned weakness into strength, fear into power, and a backwater kingdom into an empire. The Byzantines called him a monster. Bulgaria called him *savior*.

Whenever the government introduced Hindi as a compulsory language in schools, anti-Hindi protests happened and succeeded in stopping the move. The largest anti-Hindi imposition agitations in this period occurred from 1948 to 1950. After India's independence in 1947, the Congress government at the centre urged all states to make Hindi compulsory in schools. The Congress government of Madras Presidency under Omandur Ramasamy Reddiar complied and made Hindi compulsory in the 1948\u201349 academic year. It also introduced a minimum qualification in Hindi for the promotion of students to higher classes. Periyar once again launched agitation against the imposition of Hindi. The 1948 agitation was supported by former Congress nationalists like M. P. Sivagnanam and Thiru. Vi. Ka, who recanted their earlier pro-Hindi policies. On 17 July, the DK convened an all party anti-Hindi conference to oppose the compulsory Hindi teaching. As in the agitation from 1938 to 1940, this agitation was also characterized by strikes, black flag demonstrations and anti-Hindi processions. When Rajaji (then the Governor-General of India) visited Madras on 23 August, the DK staged a black flag demonstration against his visit. On 27 August, Periyar and Annadurai were arrested. The government did not change its position on Hindi and the agitation continued. On 18 December, Periyar and other DK leaders were arrested again. A compromise was reached between the government and agitators. The government stopped the legal action against the agitators and they in turn dropped the agitation on 26 December 1948. Eventually, the government made Hindi teaching optional beginning in 1950. Students who did not want to learn Hindi were allowed to participate in other school activities during Hindi classes.\n\n","h_score":1864332.6687500002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":5703644,"revid":1173910926,"description":"Agitation against the imposition of the Hindi language","categories":["Dravidian movement","Hindi","History of Tamil Nadu","Language conflict in India","Medium of instruction","Political history of Tamil Nadu","Protests in India","Social history of Tamil Nadu"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Tamil Nadu\u2019s Fire Over Hindi: How a Language Row Ignited a Decade of Protests\"**\n\n*From 1965 to 1967, Tamil Nadu\u2019s streets erupted in defiance against Hindi imposition\u2014sparking a movement that reshaped India\u2019s linguistic politics and left scars that linger today.*\n\n---\n\n### **The Spark: A Mandate That Lit the Fuse**\nThe crisis began in 1965 when the central government, led by Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, declared Hindi\u2014with Devanagari script\u2014as India\u2019s official language by 1965.

The pilot aired between Mad About You and Seinfeld, and was watched by almost 22 million American viewers. The series was a huge success throughout its run and was a staple of NBC's Thursday night line-up, dubbed by the network as Must See TV. When Crane told reporters in 2001 that the ninth season was a possibility, critics believed that he was posturing and that at least two of the cast members would not sign on for another season. When it was confirmed that Friends would return for a ninth season, the news was mainly about the amount of money\u2014\\$7 million per episode\u2014that it took to bring the series back for another season.\n\nAfter year-long expectations that the ninth season would be the series's last, NBC signed a deal in late December 2002 to bring the series back for a final tenth season. The series' creative team did not want to extend negotiations into the next year and wanted to start writing the rest of the ninth-season episodes and a potential series finale. NBC agreed to pay \\$10 million to Warner Bros. for the production of each tenth-season episode, the highest price in television history for a 30-minute series. Although NBC was unable to bring in enough advertising revenue from commercials to cover the costs, the series was integral to the Thursday night schedule, which brought high ratings and profits to the other television series. The cast demanded that the tenth season be reduced from the usual 24 episodes to 18 episodes to allow them to work on outside projects.\n\nIn fall 2001, Warner Bros. Domestic Cable made a deal with sister network TBS (both were owned by Time Warner) to air the series in rerun syndication. Warner Bros. Domestic Cable announced that it had sold additional cable rights to Friends to Nick at Nite which began airing in the fall of 2011 (unlike the TBS and broadcast syndication airings, Nick at Nite broadcasts of the series, which began airing as part of a seven-night launch marathon on September 5, 2011, replace the end credit tag scenes with marginalized credits featuring promotions for the series and other Nick at Nite programs). Warner Bros. was expected to make \\$200 million in license fees and advertising from the deal. Nick at Nite paid \\$500,000 per episode to air the episodes after 6 pm. ET for six years through fall 2017. In syndication until 2005, Friends had earned \\$4 million per episode in cash license fees for a total of \\$944 million.\n\nComedy Central began airing reruns of Friends in October 2019.\n\n","h_score":2033434.925,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":11315,"revid":1173349838,"description":"American television sitcom (1994\u20132004)","categories":["1990s American romantic comedy television series","1990s American sitcoms","1994 American television series debuts","2000s American romantic comedy television series","2000s American sitcoms","2004 American television series endings","BAFTA winners (television series)","English-language television shows","Fictional sextets","Friends (1994 TV series)","NBC original programming","Nielsen ratings winners","Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series Screen Actors Guild Award winners","Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series winners","Primetime Emmy Award-winning television series","Salary controversies in television","Television series about siblings","Television series by Warner Bros.

Its synthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme thiamine diphosphokinase according to the reaction thiamine + ATP \u2192 TPP + AMP (EC 2.7.6.2). TPP is a coenzyme for several enzymes that catalyze the transfer of two-carbon units and in particular the dehydrogenation (decarboxylation and subsequent conjugation with coenzyme A) of 2-oxoacids (alpha-keto acids). The mechanism of action of TPP as a coenzyme relies on its ability to form an ylide. Examples include:\n\n- Present in most species\n  - pyruvate dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (also called \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase)\n  - branched-chain \u03b1-keto acid dehydrogenase\n  - 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase\n  - transketolase\n- Present in some species:\n  - pyruvate decarboxylase (in yeast)\n  - several additional bacterial enzymes\n\nThe enzymes transketolase, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) are important in carbohydrate metabolism. PDH links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle. OGDH catalyzes the overall conversion of 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) to succinyl-CoA and CO<sub>2<\/sub> during the citric acid cycle. The reaction catalyzed by OGDH is a rate-limiting step in the citric acid cycle. The cytosolic enzyme transketolase is central to the pentose phosphate pathway, a major route for the biosynthesis of the pentose sugars deoxyribose and ribose. The mitochondrial PDH and OGDH are part of biochemical pathways that result in the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the main energy transfer molecule for the cell. In the nervous system, PDH is also involved in the synthesis of myelin and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.\n\n ### Thiamine triphosphate\n\nThTP is implicated in chloride channel activation in the neurons of mammals and other animals, although its role is not well understood. ThTP has been found in bacteria, fungi and plants, suggesting that it has other cellular roles. In Escherichia coli, it is implicated in the response to amino acid starvation.\n\n ### Adenosine derivatives\n\nAThDP exists in small amounts in vertebrate liver, but its role remains unknown.\n\nAThTP is present in E. coli, where it accumulates as a result of carbon starvation. In this bacterium, AThTP may account for up to 20% of total thiamine. It also exists in lesser amounts in yeast, roots of higher plants and animal tissue.\n\n ## Medical uses\n\nDuring pregnancy, thiamine is sent to the fetus via the placenta. Pregnant women have a greater requirement for the vitamin than other adults, especially during the third trimester. Pregnant women with hyperemesis gravidarum are at an increased risk of thiamine deficiency due to losses when vomiting. In lactating women, thiamine is delivered in breast milk even if it results in thiamine deficiency in the mother.\n\nThiamine is important not only for mitochondrial membrane development, but also for synaptic membrane function. It has also been suggested that a deficiency hinders brain development in infants and may be a cause of sudden infant death syndrome.\n\n ## Dietary recommendations\n\nThe US National Academy of Medicine updated the Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for thiamine in 1998. The EARs for thiamine for women and men aged 14 and over are 0.9 mg\/day and 1.1 mg\/day, respectively; the RDAs are 1.1 and 1.2 mg\/day, respectively. RDAs are higher than EARs to provide adequate intake levels for individuals with higher than average requirements. The RDA during pregnancy and for lactating females is 1.4 mg\/day. For infants up to the age of 12 months, the Adequate Intake (AI) is 0.2\u20130.3 mg\/day and for children aged 1\u201313 years the RDA increases with age from 0.5 to 0.9 mg\/day.\n\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intakes (PRIs) instead of RDAs, and Average Requirements instead of EARs. For women (including those pregnant or lactating), men and children the PRI is 0.1 mg thiamine per megajoule (MJ) of energy in their diet. As the conversion is 1 MJ = 239 kcal, an adult consuming 2390 kilocalories ought to be consuming 1.0 mg thiamine. This is slightly lower than the US RDA.\n\nNeither the National Academy of Medicine nor EFSA have set an upper intake level for thiamine, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses.\n\n ### Safety\n\nThiamine is generally well tolerated and non-toxic when administered orally. There are rare reports of adverse side effects when thiamine is given intravenously, including allergic reactions, nausea, lethargy, and impaired coordination.\n\n ### Labeling\n\nFor US food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value. Since May 27, 2016, the Daily Value has been 1.2 mg, in line with the RDA.\n\n ## Synthesis\n\n","h_score":2039585.6375000002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":30500,"revid":1170482857,"description":"Chemical compound","categories":["Aminopyrimidines","B vitamins","Cations","Coenzymes","Poultry diseases","Primary alcohols","Quaternary ammonium compounds","Thiamine","Thiazoles","Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate","World Health Organization essential medicines"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\n\ud83d\udea8 *Your brain is a thiamine-hungry beast.* It guzzles this B-vitamin like a toddler with a juice box\u2014except if it runs dry? **Chaos.** (We\u2019re talking confusion, fatigue, and nerves so fried they could power a city.)\n\n**2\/10**\nThiamine = **vitamin B1**.

It was renamed \"Windows Mobile\" in 2003, at which point it came in several versions (similar to the desktop versions of Windows) and was aimed at business and enterprise consumers. When initially released in the mid-2000s, it was to be the portable equivalent of what Windows desktop OS was: a major force in the then-emerging mobile\/portable areas.\n\nFollowing the rise of newer smartphone OSs (iOS and Android) Windows Mobile never equalled the success and faded rapidly in the following years. By February 2010, Microsoft announced the more modern and consumer-focused Windows Phone to supersede Windows Mobile. As a result, Windows Mobile has been deprecated since existing devices and software are incompatible with Windows Phone. The last version of Windows Mobile, released after the announcement of Windows Phone, was 6.5.5. After this, Microsoft ceased development on Windows Mobile in order to concentrate on Windows Phone.\n\nMicrosoft released a similarly-named Windows 10 Mobile in 2015 which was part of the Windows Phone series, and it is unrelated to the former Windows Mobile operating systems.\n\n ## Features\n\nMost versions of Windows Mobile have a standard set of features, such as multitasking and the ability to navigate a file system similar to that of Windows 9x and Windows NT, including support for many of the same file types. Similarly to its desktop counterpart, it comes bundled with a set of applications that perform basic tasks. Internet Explorer Mobile is the default web browser, and Windows Media Player is the default media player used for playing digital media. The mobile version of Microsoft Office is the default office suite.\n\nInternet Connection Sharing, supported on compatible devices, allows the phone to share its Internet connection with computers via USB and Bluetooth. Windows Mobile supports virtual private networking over PPTP protocol. Most devices with mobile connectivity also have a Radio Interface Layer. The Radio Interface Layer provides the system interface between the Cell Core layer within the Windows Mobile OS and the radio protocol stack used by the wireless modem hardware. This allows OEMs to integrate a variety of modems into their equipment.\n\nThe user interface changed dramatically between versions, only retaining similar functionality. The Today Screen, later called the Home Screen, shows the current date, owner information, upcoming appointments, e-mails, and tasks. The taskbar displays the current time as well as the volume level. Devices with a cellular radio also show the signal strength on said taskbar.\n\n ## History\n\nWindows Mobile is based on the Windows CE kernel and first appeared as the Pocket PC 2000 operating system. It includes a suite of basic applications developed with the Microsoft Windows API, and is designed to have features and appearance somewhat similar to desktop versions of Windows. It allowed third party developers to develop software for Windows Mobile with no restrictions imposed by Microsoft. Software applications were purchasable from Windows Marketplace for Mobile during the service's lifespan.\n\nMost early Windows Mobile devices came with a stylus, which can be used to enter commands by tapping it on the screen. The primary touch input technology behind most devices were resistive touchscreens which often required a stylus for input. Later devices used capacitive sensing which does not require a stylus. Along with touchscreens, a large variety of form factors existed for the platform. Some devices featured slideout keyboards, while others featured minimal face buttons.\n\n ### Windows CE\n\nMicrosoft's work on handheld portable devices began with research projects in 1990, with the work on Windows CE beginning in 1992. Initially, the OS and the user interface were developed separately. With Windows CE being based on Windows 95 code and a separate team handing the user interface which was codenamed WinPad (later Microsoft At Work for Handhelds). Windows 95 had strong pen support making porting easy; with some saying \"At this time, Windows 95 offers outstanding pen support. It is treating pens right for the first time.\" WinPad was delayed due to price and performance issues, before being scrapped in early 1995 due to touchscreen driver problems relating to WriteTouch technology, made by NCR Microelectronic Products. Although WinPad was never released as a consumer product, Alpha builds were released showcasing many interface elements. During development of WinPad a separate team worked on a project called Pulsar; designed to be a mobile communications version of WinPad, described as a \"pager on Steroids\". This project was also canceled around the same time as WinPad. The two disbanded groups would form the Pegasus project in 1995. Pegasus would work on the hardware side of the Windows CE OS, attempting to create a form factor similar to a PC-esque PDA like WinPad, with communications functionality like Pulsar. Under the name Handheld PC, a hardware reference guide was created and devices began shipping in 1996, although most of these device bore little resemblance to the goal of a pen-based touchscreen handheld device. A specification for a smaller form factor under the name Palm-size PC was released in 1998.\n\n","h_score":1908642.08125,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":1275656,"revid":1173913080,"description":"Discontinued family of mobile operating systems by Microsoft","categories":["ARM operating systems","Defunct consumer brands","Discontinued Microsoft operating systems","Discontinued versions of Microsoft Windows","Microsoft franchises","Mobile operating systems","Windows CE","Windows Mobile"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"1\/10\nWindows Mobile was Microsoft\u2019s attempt to dominate smartphones\u2014before iOS and Android.

A common example of homologous structures is the forelimbs of vertebrates, where the wings of bats and birds, the arms of primates, the front flippers of whales and the forelegs of four-legged vertebrates like dogs and crocodiles are all derived from the same ancestral tetrapod structure. Evolutionary biology explains homologous structures adapted to different purposes as the result of descent with modification from a common ancestor. The term was first applied to biology in a non-evolutionary context by the anatomist Richard Owen in 1843. Homology was later explained by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution in 1859, but had been observed before this, from Aristotle onwards, and it was explicitly analysed by Pierre Belon in 1555.\n\nIn developmental biology, organs that developed in the embryo in the same manner and from similar origins, such as from matching primordia in successive segments of the same animal, are serially homologous. Examples include the legs of a centipede, the maxillary palp and labial palp of an insect, and the spinous processes of successive vertebrae in a vertebral column. Male and female reproductive organs are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue, as do the ovaries and testicles of mammals including humans.\n\nSequence homology between protein or DNA sequences is similarly defined in terms of shared ancestry. Two segments of DNA can have shared ancestry because of either a speciation event (orthologs) or a duplication event (paralogs). Homology among proteins or DNA is inferred from their sequence similarity. Significant similarity is strong evidence that two sequences are related by divergent evolution from a common ancestor. Alignments of multiple sequences are used to discover the homologous regions.\n\nHomology remains controversial in animal behaviour, but there is suggestive evidence that, for example, dominance hierarchies are homologous across the primates.\n\n","h_score":2069639.39375,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":142431,"revid":1172779955,"description":"Shared ancestry between a pair of structures or genes in different taxa","categories":["Comparative anatomy","Evolutionary biology concepts","Phylogenetics"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Hidden Blueprint: How Life\u2019s \u2018Copy-Paste\u2019 Shapes Evolution\"**\n\n*From DNA to dolphins, the same ancient code links all living things\u2014revealing how nature recycles its greatest designs.*\n\n---\n\n### **A Universal Toolkit**\nImagine evolution as a master chef, endlessly remixing the same core ingredients. **Homology** is the biological equivalent: the striking similarity between structures or genes across species that share a common ancestor.

Brewer","reference":"## Supreme Court (1890\u20131910)\n\nBrewer remained on the Court for twenty years, serving until his death in 1910. He authored 719 opinions, 157 of which were dissents. Melville Fuller was chief justice throughout Brewer's tenure; the Fuller Court has been described as mainly loyal to business interests and laissez-faire economic principles, although late-twentieth-century revisionist scholars have rejected that narrative. Brewer has often been described as an extremely conservative justice. According to Paul, he \"held to a strictly conservative, sometimes reactionary, position on the Court, opposing firmly the expansion of government regulatory power, state or federal\" and making \"little pretense of 'judicial self-restraint' and few compromises to Court consensus\". Some scholars argued in the 1990s that Brewer was more of a moderate than his critics admitted, contending that his reputation as a reactionary was based largely on a small and unrepresentative sample of his comments and opinions. While admitting that \"Brewer can fairly be labeled a conservative\", the legal scholar J. Gordon Hylton wrote in 1994 that \"to say that he was a self-conscious defender of the interests of corporate America or an enthusiastic disciple of laissez-faire is both unfair and inaccurate\".\n\nBrewer held an activist conception of the judicial role. His constitutional views were shaped by his religious beliefs, and he emphasized natural justice in his written opinions. According to the legal scholar Owen M. Fiss, Brewer and his \"constant ally\" Rufus W. Peckham were the \"intellectual leaders\" of the Fuller Court\u2014justices who, while not always in the majority, were \"influential within the dominant coalition and the source of the ideas that gave the Court its sweep and direction\". Brewer's views were also aligned with those of his uncle\u2014Justice Stephen J. Field\u2014a staunch defender of property rights with whom he served for eight years. Brewer supported states' rights and felt that the judiciary should limit governmental actions that interfere with the free market, although the legal historian Kermit L. Hall writes that his jurisprudence \"was not altogether predictable\" because \"[h]is Congregational, missionary, and anti-slavery roots meant that he had a sympathetic ear for the disadvantaged\".\n\n","h_score":1874352.5875000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":912160,"revid":1170055645,"description":"US Supreme Court justice from 1890 to 1910","categories":["1837 births","1910 deaths","19th-century American judges","20th-century American judges","Albany Law School alumni","American Congregationalists","Colorado Republicans","District attorneys in Kansas","Field family","George Washington University faculty","Judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit","Judges of the United States circuit courts","Justices of the Kansas Supreme Court","Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States","Kansas Republicans","Kansas state court judges","Missouri Republicans","People from \u0130zmir","People of Kansas in the American Civil War","United States federal judges admitted to the practice of law by reading law","United States federal judges appointed by Benjamin Harrison","United States federal judges appointed by Chester A.

At the time of recording, the band members were 15 years old and still attending high school. Frogstomps lyrical concepts were fiction-based, drawing inspiration from television, hometown tragedies, and perceptions of the pain of friends. The album was well received: AllMusic and Rolling Stone rated it in four and four-and-a-half stars, respectively, praising the intensity of the album, especially \"Tomorrow\". Frogstomp was a number-one album in Australia and New Zealand. It reached the Billboard 200 Top 10, making Silverchair the first Australian band to do so since INXS. It was certified as a US double-platinum album by the RIAA, triple-platinum in Canada by the CRIA, and multi-platinum in Australia. The album sold more than 4 million copies worldwide. Paste magazine called this album the \"last stand\" of grunge. As Frogstomp and \"Tomorrow\" continued to gain popularity through 1995, the group toured the US, where they supported Red Hot Chili Peppers in June, the Ramones in September, and played on the roof of Radio City Music Hall at the MTV Music Awards. In between touring, they continued their secondary education in Newcastle. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1995, the band won five awards out of nine nominations. To collect their awards on the night, they sent Josh Shirley, the young son of the album's producer. At the ceremony, they performed Radio Birdman's \"New Race\" with Tim Rogers (of You Am I); in 2019, Dan Condon of Double J rated this as one of the \"7 great performances from the history of the ARIA Awards.\" On 9 December 1995, Silverchair played two songs, \"Tomorrow\" and \"Pure Massacre\" on Saturday Night Live. In a January 1996 murder case, the defendant counsel for Brian Bassett, 16, and Nicholaus McDonald, 18, of McCleary, Washington, claimed that the pair listened to \"Israel's Son\", from Frogstomp, which contributed to the 10 August 1995 murders of Bassett's parents and a younger brother. McDonald's lawyer cited the lyrics \"Hate is what I feel for you\/I want you to know that I want you dead\" which were \"almost a script. They're relevant to everything that happened\". The band's manager, Watson, issued a statement that they did not condone nor intend any such acts of violence. Prosecutors rejected the defence case and convinced the jury that the murder was committed to \"steal money and belongings and run off to California.\" Silverchair began recording their second studio album, Freak Show, in May 1996 while experiencing the success of Frogstomp in Australia and the US. Produced by Nick Launay (Birthday Party, Models, Midnight Oil) and released in February 1997, the album reached number one in Australia and yielded three top-10 singles: \"Freak\", \"Abuse Me\", and \"Cemetery\". Its fourth single, \"The Door\", reached No. 25.The songs focused on the anger and backlash that the expectations of Frogstomp brought upon the band. Freak Show was certified gold in the US, 2\u00d7 platinum in Australia, and global sales eventually exceeded 1.5 million copies.","h_score":1867529.34375,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":390763,"revid":1173245801,"description":"Australian rock band","categories":["1992 establishments in Australia","2011 disestablishments in Australia","ARIA Award winners","Australian alternative metal musical groups","Australian grunge groups","Australian musical trios","Australian post-grunge groups","Australian rock music groups","Musical groups disestablished in 2011","Musical groups established in 1992","New South Wales musical groups","Newcastle, New South Wales","Silverchair","World Music Awards winners"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nPicture this: 1991.

The stone tools were found near Paranthropus teeth.\n\nBone tools dating between 2.3 and 0.6 mya have been found in abundance in Swartkrans, Kromdraai and Drimolen caves, and are often associated with P. robustus. Though Homo is also known from these caves, their remains are comparatively scarce to Paranthropus, making Homo-attribution unlikely. The tools also cooccur with Homo-associated Oldawan and possibly Acheulian stone tool industries. The bone tools were typically sourced from the shaft of long bones from medium- to large-sized mammals, but tools made sourced from mandibles, ribs and horn cores have also been found. Bone tools have also been found at Oldawan Gorge and directly associated with P. boisei, the youngest dating to 1.34 mya, though a great proportion of other bone tools from here have ambiguous attribution. Stone tools from Kromdraai could possibly be attributed to P. robustus, as no Homo have been found there yet.\n\nThe bone tools were not manufactured or purposefully shaped for a task.

Mercury received impacts over its entire surface during this period of intense crater formation, facilitated by the lack of any atmosphere to slow impactors down. During this time Mercury was volcanically active; basins were filled by magma, producing smooth plains similar to the maria found on the Moon. One of the most unusual craters is Apollodorus, or \"the Spider\", which hosts a serious of radiating troughs extending outwards from its impact site.\n\nCraters on Mercury range in diameter from small bowl-shaped cavities to multi-ringed impact basins hundreds of kilometers across. They appear in all states of degradation, from relatively fresh rayed craters to highly degraded crater remnants. Mercurian craters differ subtly from lunar craters in that the area blanketed by their ejecta is much smaller, a consequence of Mercury's stronger surface gravity. According to International Astronomical Union rules, each new crater must be named after an artist who was famous for more than fifty years, and dead for more than three years, before the date the crater is named.\n\nThe largest known crater is Caloris Planitia, or Caloris Basin, with a diameter of 1,550 km. The impact that created the Caloris Basin was so powerful that it caused lava eruptions and left a concentric mountainous ring \\~2 km tall surrounding the impact crater. The floor of the Caloris Basin is filled by a geologically distinct flat plain, broken up by ridges and fractures in a roughly polygonal pattern. It is not clear whether they are volcanic lava flows induced by the impact or a large sheet of impact melt.\n\nAt the antipode of the Caloris Basin is a large region of unusual, hilly terrain known as the \"Weird Terrain\". One hypothesis for its origin is that shock waves generated during the Caloris impact traveled around Mercury, converging at the basin's antipode (180 degrees away). The resulting high stresses fractured the surface. Alternatively, it has been suggested that this terrain formed as a result of the convergence of ejecta at this basin's antipode.\n\nOverall, 46 impact basins have been identified. A notable basin is the 400 km wide, multi-ring Tolstoj Basin that has an ejecta blanket extending up to 500 km from its rim and a floor that has been filled by smooth plains materials. Beethoven Basin has a similar-sized ejecta blanket and a 625 km diameter rim. Like the Moon, the surface of Mercury has likely incurred the effects of space weathering processes, including solar wind and micrometeorite impacts.\n\n #### Plains\n\nThere are two geologically distinct plains regions on Mercury. Gently rolling, hilly plains in the regions between craters are Mercury's oldest visible surfaces, predating the heavily cratered terrain. These inter-crater plains appear to have obliterated many earlier craters, and show a general paucity of smaller craters below about 30 km in diameter.\n\nSmooth plains are widespread flat areas that fill depressions of various sizes and bear a strong resemblance to the lunar maria. Unlike lunar maria, the smooth plains of Mercury have the same albedo as the older inter-crater plains. Despite a lack of unequivocally volcanic characteristics, the localisation and rounded, lobate shape of these plains strongly support volcanic origins. All the smooth plains of Mercury formed significantly later than the Caloris basin, as evidenced by appreciably smaller crater densities than on the Caloris ejecta blanket.\n\n #### Compressional features\n\nOne unusual feature of Mercury's surface is the numerous compression folds, or rupes, that crisscross the plains. These also exist on the moon, but are much more prominent on Mercury. As Mercury's interior cooled, it contracted and its surface began to deform, creating wrinkle ridges and lobate scarps associated with thrust faults. The scarps can reach lengths of 1000 km and heights of 3 km. These compressional features can be seen on top of other features, such as craters and smooth plains, indicating they are more recent. Mapping of the features has suggested a total shrinkage of Mercury's radius in the range of \\~1 to 7 km. Most activity along the major thrust systems probably ended about 3.6\u20133.7 billion years ago. Small-scale thrust fault scarps have been found, tens of meters in height and with lengths in the range of a few km, that appear to be less than 50 million years old, indicating that compression of the interior and consequent surface geological activity continue to the present.\n\n #### Volcanism\n\nThere is evidence for pyroclastic flows on Mercury from low-profile shield volcanoes. 51 pyroclastic deposits have been identified, where 90% of them are found within impact craters. A study of the degradation state of the impact craters that host pyroclastic deposits suggests that pyroclastic activity occurred on Mercury over a prolonged interval.\n\nA \"rimless depression\" inside the southwest rim of the Caloris Basin consists of at least nine overlapping volcanic vents, each individually up to 8 km in diameter. It is thus a \"compound volcano\". The vent floors are at least 1 km below their brinks and they bear a closer resemblance to volcanic craters sculpted by explosive eruptions or modified by collapse into void spaces created by magma withdrawal back down into a conduit. Scientists could not quantify the age of the volcanic complex system but reported that it could be on the order of a billion years.\n\n","h_score":2114859.9624999999,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":19694,"revid":1173394872,"description":"First planet from the Sun","categories":["Astronomical objects known since antiquity","Mercury (planet)","Planets of the Solar System","Terrestrial planets"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Mercury: The Solar System\u2019s Tiny, Toxic Speed Demon\"**\n\n*It\u2019s the smallest planet, the fastest orbiter, and a scorched wasteland\u2014yet Mercury holds secrets that could rewrite how we see the cosmos.

In 1995, Germany won its third European Championship. After winning all qualification matches, scoring 55 goals, the German team defeated England 6\u20132 over two legs in the semi-final. Germany met Sweden in the final, which was played at the Fritz Walter Stadion in Kaiserslautern, Germany, on 26 March 1995. The Swedish team managed to score early, but Germany came back to win 3\u20132 with goals from Maren Meinert, Birgit Prinz and Bettina Wiegmann. At the 1995 Women's World Cup in Sweden, the German team lost against the Scandinavian hosts, but still succeeded in winning their group by beating Japan and Brazil. Germany won the quarter-final against England 3\u20130, and defeated China 1\u20130 with a late goal by Bettina Wiegmann in the semi-final. On 18 June 1995 in Stockholm, the German team appeared in their first Women's World Cup final. Facing Norway, they lost the match 0\u20132, but as runners-up achieved their best World Cup result until then. Women's football was first played as an Olympic sport at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Bettina Wiegmann scored the first Olympic goal in the opening match against Japan, which Germany won 3\u20132. After losing their second group game against Norway 2\u20133, and drawing with Brazil 1\u20131, Germany was eliminated, finishing third in the group with four points from three matches. Head coach Gero Bisanz resigned after the tournament and his assistant since 1983, Tina Theune, took over as the new national coach. Silvia Neid ended her playing career and was appointed the new assistant coach. The 1997 European Championship was the first test for new coach Theune. Following a defeat against Norway, Germany finished second in the qualifying group and only secured qualification by beating Iceland in a relegation play-off. After drawing with Italy and Norway, a victory over Denmark in the last group game saw the German team go through to the knockout stage. They beat Sweden 1\u20130 in the semi-final, and on 12 July 1997, claimed their fourth European championship with a 2\u20130 win over Italy, with goals from Sandra Minnert and Birgit Prinz. At the 1999 Women's World Cup in the United States, the German team also failed to qualify directly, but managed to beat Ukraine in a qualifying play-off. Germany started their World Cup campaign by drawing with Italy and winning 6\u20130 over Mexico. In the last group game, Germany drew 3\u20133 against Brazil; by conceding a last minute equalizer, Germany failed to win the group and subsequently had to face the hosts in the quarter-final. With 54,642 people in attendance, among them U.S. President Bill Clinton, the crowd at the Jack Kent Cooke Stadium was the biggest the German team had ever played in front of. Despite leading twice, they lost 2\u20133 to the eventual World Cup winners. Germany competed at the 2000 Summer Olympics, winning all three group games against Australia, Brazil and Sweden. The German team dominated the semi-final against Norway, but lost the game 0\u20131 after an own goal by Tina Wunderlich in the 80th minute. They beat Brazil 2\u20130 in the third place match with goals from Birgit Prinz and Renate Lingor, and won the bronze medal. It was the first Olympic medal for the German Football Associations since 1988 when the men's team also won bronze. In 2001, Germany hosted the European Championship. Following victories over Sweden, Russia and England in the group stage, the German team beat Norway 1\u20130 in the semi-final courtesy of a diving header by Sandra Smisek. On 7 July 2001 in Ulm, they met Sweden in the final, which was played in heavy rain. The game was scoreless after 90 minutes and went to extra time, where Claudia M\u00fcller scored a golden goal and secured the fifth European title for Germany.","h_score":1897819.5125000002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":662281,"revid":1173435563,"description":"Women's national association football team representing Germany","categories":["European women's national association football teams","FIFA Women's World Cup-winning countries","Germany women's national football team","Recipients of the Silver Laurel Leaf","UEFA Women's Championship-winning countries"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nImagine a team so fierce, they turn stadiums into roaring oceans.

Upon hatching, they measure about 4.6 cm (1.8 in) and weigh about 20 g (0.7 oz). The eggs are typically laid on the beach in an area above the high-tide line. The eggs are laid near the water so the hatchlings can return to the sea. The loggerhead's sex is dictated by the temperature of the underground nest. Incubation temperatures generally range from 26\u201332 \u00b0C (79\u201390 \u00b0F). Sea turtle eggs kept at a constant incubating temperature of 32 \u00b0C become females. Eggs incubating at 28 \u00b0C become males. An incubation temperature of 30 \u00b0C results in an equal ratio of male to female hatchlings. Hatchlings from eggs in the middle of the clutch tend to be the largest, grow the fastest, and be the most active during the first few days of sea life.\n\nAfter incubating for around 80 days, hatchlings dig through the sand to the surface, usually at night, when darkness increases the chance of escaping predation and damage from extreme sand surface temperatures is reduced. Hatchlings enter the ocean by navigating toward the brighter horizon created by the reflection of the moon and starlight off the water's surface.\n\nHatchlings can lose up to 20% of their body mass due to evaporation of water as they journey from nest to ocean. They initially use the undertow to push them five to 10 m away from the shore. Once in the ocean, they swim for about 20 hours, taking them far offshore. An iron compound, magnetite, in their brains allows the turtles to perceive the Earth's magnetic field, for navigation. Many hatchlings use Sargassum in the open ocean as protection until they reach 45 cm (18 in). Hatchling loggerheads live in this pelagic environment until they reach juvenile age, and then they migrate to nearshore waters.\n\n ### Maturation\n\nWhen ocean waters cool, loggerheads must migrate to warmer areas or hibernate to some degree. In the coldest months, they submerge for up to seven hours at a time, emerging for only seven minutes to breathe. Although outdone by freshwater turtles, these are among the longest recorded dives for any air-breathing marine vertebrate. During their seasonal migration, juvenile loggerheads have the ability to use both magnetic and visual cues. When both aids are available, they are used in conjunction; if one aid is not available, the other suffices. The turtles swim at about 1.6 km\/h (0.9 kn; 0.4 m\/s) during migration.\n\nLike all marine turtles, the loggerhead prepares for reproduction in its foraging area. This takes place several years before the loggerhead migrates to a mating area. Female loggerheads first reproduce at ages 28\u201333 in Southeastern United States and Australia, and at ages 17\u201330 in South Africa. Age at first reproduction in the Mediterranean, Oman, Japan, and Brazil are unknown. Nesting loggerheads have a straight carapace length of 70\u2013109 cm (28\u201343 in). Because of the large range, carapace length is not a reliable indicator of sexual maturity. Their estimated maximum lifespan is 47\u201367 years in the wild.\n\n","h_score":2090343.2437500001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":1903166,"revid":1170914734,"description":"Species of marine reptile distributed throughout the world","categories":["Caretta","Cosmopolitan vertebrates","EPBC Act endangered biota","Endangered animals","Nature Conservation Act endangered biota","Reptiles described in 1758","Sea turtles","Symbols of Florida","Symbols of South Carolina","Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\n\ud83d\udc22 *Meet the ancient warrior of the sea*\u2014the loggerhead turtle.

Jeter led the AL in hits that season with 219, while finishing second in the league in batting average (.349) and runs scored (134), appearing in his second All-Star game that year. His season totals in batting average, runs, hits, runs batted in, doubles (37), triples (9), home runs (24), SLG (.552), and OBP (.438) are all personal bests. Jeter, who for part of the year hit third in the batting order, also drove in 102 runs, becoming only the second Yankee shortstop to do so, following Lyn Lary's 107 RBIs in 1931. In the postseason, Jeter batted .455 in the ALDS, .350 in the ALCS, and .353 in the World Series, as the Yankees defeated the Braves to win another championship, Jeter's third. During the 1999\u20132000 offseason, the Yankees negotiated with Jeter, tentatively agreeing to a seven-year, \\$118.5 million contract. However, because Steinbrenner did not want to set a record for the largest contract, Steinbrenner waited while Juan Gonz\u00e1lez and the Detroit Tigers negotiated on a reported eight-year, \\$143 million contract extension. When that agreement fell through, so did Jeter's tentative deal. To avoid arbitration, Jeter and the Yankees agreed to a one-year deal worth \\$10 million. Jeter batted a team-best .339 in the 2000 regular season and added 15 home runs, 73 RBIs, 119 runs scored, and 22 stolen bases. In the 2000 MLB All-Star Game, he recorded three hits, including a two-run single that gave his team the lead and victory. The performance earned him the All-Star Game MVP Award, the first time a Yankee won the award. During the postseason, he batted only .211 in the Division Series but rebounded to hit .318 in the Championship Series against the Seattle Mariners, and .409 in the World Series against the New York Mets. Jeter added two home runs, a triple, and two doubles in the World Series, including a leadoff home run on the first pitch of Game 4 and a triple later in the third inning. His home run in Game 5 tied the game and extended his World Series hitting streak to 14 games. The Yankees defeated the Mets in five games for their third consecutive title and fourth in Jeter's first five full seasons. Jeter won the World Series MVP Award, becoming the first (and so far only) player to win the All-Star Game MVP and World Series MVP Awards in the same season. With one year remaining until he would become eligible for free agency, Jeter signed a ten-year, \\$189 million contract before the 2001 season to remain with the Yankees. Alex Rodriguez had signed a ten-year, \\$252 million contract with the Texas Rangers earlier in the offseason, setting the market for Jeter's negotiations.","h_score":1894631.6812500001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":218947,"revid":1173490275,"description":"American baseball player (born 1974)","categories":["1974 births","2006 World Baseball Classic players","2009 World Baseball Classic players","21st-century African-American businesspeople","African-American Catholics","African-American baseball players","Albany-Colonie Yankees players","American League All-Stars","American people of English descent","American people of German descent","American people of Irish descent","American philanthropists","Baseball players from Michigan","Baseball players from New Jersey","Baseball players from the Bronx","Businesspeople from Michigan","Businesspeople from New Jersey","Businesspeople from New York City","Catholics from Michigan","Catholics from New Jersey","Catholics from New York (state)","Columbus Clippers players","Gold Glove Award winners","Greensboro Hornets players","Gulf Coast Yankees players","Kalamazoo Central High School alumni","Living people","Major League Baseball All-Star Game MVPs","Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award winners","Major League Baseball executives","Major League Baseball players with retired numbers","Major League Baseball shortstops","Miami Marlins executives","Miami Marlins owners","National Baseball Hall of Fame inductees","New York Yankees players","People from Marlboro Township, New Jersey","People from North Arlington, New Jersey","People from Pequannock Township, New Jersey","Scranton\/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders players","Silver Slugger Award winners","Sportspeople from Kalamazoo, Michigan","Sportspeople from Morris County, New Jersey","Tampa Yankees players","Trenton Thunder players","World Baseball Classic players of the United States","World Series Most Valuable Player Award winners"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Derek Jeter: The Captain Who Turned Shortstops Into Shrines\"**\n\n*From Yankee Stadium to the Hall of Fame, Jeter didn\u2019t just play baseball\u2014he turned the game into a religion.

Emperor Frederick appealed to Matthias for support, hinting at the possibility of Matthias's election as King of the Romans\u2014first step towards the imperial throne. Matthias declared war on Victor's father King George of Bohemia on 31 March. He said he also wanted to help the Czech Catholic lords against their \"heretic monarch\" whom the Pope had excommunicated. Matthias expelled the Czech troops from Austria and invaded Moravia and Silesia. He took an active part in the fighting; he was injured during the siege of T\u0159eb\u00ed\u010d in May 1468 and was captured at Chrudim while spying out the enemy camp in disguise in February 1469. On the latter occasion, he was released because he made his custodians believe he was a local Czech groom. The Diet of 1468 authorized Matthias to levy an extraordinary tax to finance the new war, but only after 8 prelates and 13 secular lords pledged on the King's behalf that he would not demand such charges in the future. Matthias also exercised royal prerogatives to increase his revenues. For instance, he ordered a Palatine's eyre in a county, the cost of which were to be covered by the local inhabitants but soon authorized the county to redeem the cancellation of this irksome duty. The Czech Catholics, who were led by Zden\u011bk of \u0160ternberk, joined forces with Matthias in February 1469. Their united troops were encircled at Vil\u00e9mov by George of Pod\u011bbrady's army. In fear of being captured, Matthias opened negotiations with his former father-in-law. They met in a nearby hovel, where Matthias persuaded George of Pod\u011bbrady to sign an armistice promising that he would mediate a reconciliation between the moderate Hussites and the Holy See. Their next meeting took place in Olomouc in April. Here the papal legates came forward with demands including the appointment of a Catholic Archbishop to the See of Prague, which could not be accepted by George of Pod\u011bbrady. The Czech Catholic Estates elected Matthias King of Bohemia in Olomouc on 3 May but he was never crowned. Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia soon accepted his rule but Bohemia proper remained faithful to George of Pod\u011bbrady. The Estates of Bohemia even acknowledged the right of Vladislaus Jagiello, the eldest son of Casimir IV of Poland, to succeed king George of Pod\u011bbrady. Matthias's relations with Frederick III had in the meantime deteriorated because the Emperor accused Matthias of allowing the Ottomans to march through Slavonia when raiding the Emperor's realms. The Frangepan family, whose domains in Croatia were exposed to Ottoman raids, entered into negotiations with the Emperor and the Republic of Venice.","h_score":2060388.3500000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":272105,"revid":1170269037,"description":"King of Hungary and Croatia from 1458 to 1490","categories":["1443 births","1490 deaths","15th-century Hungarian nobility","15th-century dukes of Austria","15th-century monarchs in Europe","Anti-kings","Burials at the Basilica of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary","History of Cluj-Napoca","Hungarian Roman Catholics","Hungarian book and manuscript collectors","Hunyadi family","Kings of Croatia","Kings of Hungary","Medieval child monarchs","Military personnel from Cluj-Napoca","Pretenders to the Bohemian throne"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Hungary\u2019s Forgotten Renaissance King: How Matthias Corvinus Shaped Europe**\n\n*Matthias Corvinus ruled 15th-century Hungary with military brilliance and cultural ambition, yet his legacy remains overshadowed by contemporaries like Vlad the Impaler.

A few days after Toy Story's release, John Lasseter was traveling with his family and found a young boy clutching a Sheriff Woody doll at an airport. Lasseter described how the boy's excitement to show it to his father touched him deeply. Lasseter realized that his character no longer belonged to him only, but rather it belonged to others, as well. The memory was a defining factor in the production of Toy Story 2, with Lasseter moved to create a great film for that child and for everyone else who loved the characters.\n\nEd Catmull, Lasseter, and Ralph Guggenheim visited Joe Roth, successor to recently ousted Jeffrey Katzenberg as chairman of Walt Disney Studios, shortly afterward. Roth was pleased and embraced the idea of a sequel. Disney had recently begun making direct-to-video sequels to its successful features, and Roth wanted to handle the Toy Story sequel this way, as well. Prior releases, such as 1994's Aladdin sequel, The Return of Jafar, had returned an estimated \\$100 million in profits.\n\nInitially, everything regarding Toy Story 2 was uncertain at first: whether stars Tom Hanks and Tim Allen would be available and affordable, what the story premise would be, and even whether the film would be computer-animated at Pixar or traditionally hand-drawn at Walt Disney Feature Animation. Lasseter regarded the project as a chance to groom new directing talent, as top choices were already immersed in other projects (Andrew Stanton as co-director of A Bug's Life and Pete Docter as director of what would eventually become Monsters, Inc.). Instead, Lasseter turned to Ash Brannon, a young directing animator on Toy Story whose work he admired. Brannon, a CalArts graduate, joined the Toy Story team in 1993. Disney and Pixar officially announced the sequel in a press release on March 12, 1997.\n\n","h_score":1870274.3062500001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":335298,"revid":1173858411,"description":"1999 American animated film","categories":["1990s American animated films","1990s English-language films","1990s buddy comedy films","1990s children's animated films","1990s fantasy comedy films","1999 comedy films","1999 computer-animated films","1999 films","3D animated films","3D re-releases","American 3D films","American adventure comedy films","American buddy comedy films","American children's animated comedy films","American children's animated fantasy films","American computer-animated films","American fantasy comedy films","American sequel films","Animated buddy films","Best Animated Feature Annie Award winners","Best Animated Feature Broadcast Film Critics Association Award winners","Best Musical or Comedy Picture Golden Globe winners","Disney controversies","Film controversies","Films about dolls","Films about toys","Films directed by Ash Brannon","Films directed by John Lasseter","Films scored by Randy Newman","Films with screenplays by Andrew Stanton","Films with screenplays by John Lasseter","Films with screenplays by Pete Docter","Pixar animated films","Sentient toys in fiction","Toy Story","Walt Disney Pictures animated films"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Toy Story 2: The Plot Thickens\u2014And So Does the Nostalgia\"**\n\n*Pixar\u2019s 1999 sequel turned a kids\u2019 movie into a masterclass in emotional blackmail\u2014proving that even plastic heroes can break your heart.*\n\n---\n\n**A HEIST WRITTEN IN PIXELS**\nToy Story 2 wasn\u2019t just a sequel; it was a *hostage situation*.

The match also marked the first time a fifth set tiebreaker was played at 12 games all in the men's singles and was the longest men's final in Wimbledon history. Federer next played at the 2019 Cincinnati Masters and reached the third round where he lost in straight sets to Andrey Rublev. This was his quickest defeat in 16 years, taking just 62 minutes. At the 2019 US Open, he was seeded third. He dropped the first set against both Sumit Nagal and Damir D\u017eumhur in the first two rounds, but pulled out convincing straight sets wins over Dan Evans and David Goffin in the third and fourth. In the quarterfinals, he faced Grigor Dimitrov, who was ranked No. 78 going into the tournament. Despite taking a two sets to one lead, Federer ultimately lost the match in five sets. At the 2019 Shanghai Masters, Federer defeated David Goffin in straight sets to reach the quarterfinals. However, he lost the quarterfinal to Alexander Zverev in three sets. Federer advanced to the Swiss Indoors as the two-time defending champion. His first round match, against Peter Gojowczyk, was remarkable for being the 1500th match of his career. In the final, he defeated Alex de Minaur in straight sets for a record-extending tenth Swiss Indoors title. Federer then played in the Bj\u00f6rn Borg group at the 2019 ATP Finals where in the round robin, he lost his opening match to Dominic Thiem in straight sets but beat Matteo Berrettini and Djokovic (his first win over Djokovic since 2015) in straight sets to qualify for the semifinals. He then lost the semifinal to Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets. ### 2020s\n\n #### 2020: Australian Open semifinals and right knee surgery\n\nFederer began his 2020 season at the 2020 Australian Open. He reached the semifinals after straight sets wins over Steve Johnson and Filip Krajinovi\u0107, a five-set win over John Millman and a four-set win over M\u00e1rton Fucsovics. Federer saved seven match points in his five-set quarterfinal win over Tennys Sandgren. Federer then lost his semifinal match to Djokovic in straight sets, having sustained a groin injury earlier in the tournament. In February, Federer underwent arthroscopic surgery for a right knee injury and subsequently withdrew from the Dubai Championships, Indian Wells, Miami Open, and the French Open to give time for his knee to recover, announcing that he would return in the grass season. On 10 June, due to a setback from his initial rehabilitation from the knee injury suffered earlier in the year, Federer announced that he had to have an additional arthroscopic procedure on his right knee. He officially shut down his season to take the necessary time to recover, vowing to return in 2021.

Schirra and Stafford became the backup crew for the new Gemini 3 crew, Gus Grissom and John Young, and were subsequently scheduled for the Gemini 6 primary crew. Gemini 6 was originally scheduled to perform the first orbital docking with an Agena target vehicle. The Agena vehicle exploded during its launch into orbit on October 25, 1965, while Schirra and Stafford waited in their spacecraft to lift off. Program managers decided that rather than wait for a replacement Agena to be available, they would revise the mission, calling it Gemini 6A and having it attempt a rendezvous with Gemini 7, to be flown by Frank Borman and Jim Lovell. On December 4, 1965, Gemini 7 lifted off to begin its two-week mission. Gemini 6A prepared to launch on December 12, but its engines shut down less than two seconds after ignition. Despite protocols calling for the astronauts to eject from the spacecraft in the event of an engine shutdown, Schirra chose not to activate his and Stafford's rocket-powered ejection seats, saving them both from probable injuries and a further delay and possible cancellation of the mission. Gemini 6A lifted off on December 15 and successfully rendezvoused with Gemini 7 after five hours of flight. The two spacecraft maneuvered to within one foot of each other and kept station for 5 hours. Following the rendezvous, Gemini 6A deorbited on December 16 and was recovered in the Atlantic ocean southeast of Cape Canaveral by the USS Wasp.\n\nWhile on the Gemini mission, Schirra played a Christmas practical joke on the flight controllers by first reporting a mock UFO (implying Santa Claus) sighting, then playing \"Jingle Bells\" on a four-hole Hohner harmonica he had smuggled on board, accompanied by Stafford on sleigh bells.\n\n","h_score":1887746.45625,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":331463,"revid":1165685658,"description":"American astronaut (1923\u20132007)","categories":["1923 births","1962 in spaceflight","1965 in spaceflight","1968 in spaceflight","2007 deaths","20th-century American businesspeople","American Episcopalians","American Freemasons","American Korean War pilots","American aerospace engineers","American autobiographers","American business executives","American male non-fiction writers","American people of Italian descent","American test pilots","Apollo 7","Apollo program astronauts","Aviators from New Jersey","Bell Records artists","Burials at sea","Collier Trophy recipients","Dwight Morrow High School alumni","Emmy Award winners","Harmon Trophy winners","Mercury Seven","Military personnel from New Jersey","National Aviation Hall of Fame inductees","People from Hackensack, New Jersey","People from Oradell, New Jersey","Project Gemini astronauts","Recipients of the Air Medal","Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)","Recipients of the NASA Distinguished Service Medal","Recipients of the NASA Exceptional Service Medal","Recipients of the Navy Distinguished Service Medal","Recipients of the Philippine Legion of Honor","United States Astronaut Hall of Fame inductees","United States Naval Academy alumni","United States Naval Aviators","United States Naval Test Pilot School alumni","United States Navy astronauts","United States Navy officers","United States Navy personnel of World War II","United States Navy personnel of the Korean War","Wally Schirra","Writers from New Jersey"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"1\/10\nMeet Wally Schirra: NASA\u2019s \"Original Sarcastic Astronaut.\" A Mercury 7 pioneer, he flew 3 missions\u2014including the first *and* last Mercury flights. A legend with a sharp wit and unshakable cool. Let\u2019s break down why he stands out. #SpaceHistory\n\n---\n\n2\/10\nSchirra was the *only* astronaut to fly in all 3 early NASA programs: Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo. His adaptability and skill made him a bridge between eras. Few matched his versatility.\n\n---\n\n3\/10\nHis first mission, *Sigma 7* (1962), was nearly scrubbed due to weather. Schirra joked, \u201cI\u2019m not going to get my hair wet for this.\u201d He orbited Earth 6 times, proving humans could survive spaceflight.\n\n---\n\n4\/10\nSchirra\u2019s *Gemini 6A* (1965) was a first: the first space rendezvous. He and Tom Stafford flew within a foot of *Gemini 7*\u2014a precision maneuver that set the stage for moon landings. No room for error.\n\n---\n\n5\/10\nHe was also the first (and only) astronaut to *walk out* of a space capsule mid-flight during *Gemini 6A*. Why? To retrieve a microreel camera. Because even in space, the show must go on.\n\n---\n\n6\/10\nSchirra\u2019s Apollo 7 (1968) was NASA\u2019s first crewed mission after the Apollo 1 fire. He and his crew tested the command module, enduring a rough ride. Schirra\u2019s dry humor kept morale up\u2014even when sick in zero-G.\n\n---\n\n7\/10\nOff-duty, Schirra was known for his sarcasm and no-nonsense attitude. When asked about training, he deadpanned, \u201cI don\u2019t train. I just show up.\u201d His confidence was legendary.\n\n---\n\n8\/10\nAfter NASA, he became a vocal critic of the *Space Shuttle* program, calling its design \u201ca flying coffin.\u201d His blunt honesty (even to NASA brass) made him a respected but polarizing figure.\n\n---\n\n9\/10\nSchirra\u2019s legacy? He flew higher, longer, and smarter than most. A Mercury pioneer, a Gemini innovator, and an Apollo troubleshooter\u2014all while keeping his cool. Few astronauts matched his range.\n\n---\n10\/10\nWhy remember Schirra? Because spaceflight wasn\u2019t just about heroism\u2014it was about *competence*. His precision, adaptability, and wit made him one of NASA\u2019s most underrated assets. The original astronaut, unfiltered. #FirstInSpace"}

The profit-sharing agreement for the series split proceeds between Norway, Desilu (later Paramount Television), William Shatner's production company, and the broadcast network, NBC. However, Star Trek lost money during its initial broadcast, and NBC did not expect to recoup its losses by selling the series into syndication, nor did Paramount. With NBC's approval, Paramount offered its share of the series to Roddenberry sometime in 1970. However, Roddenberry could not raise the \\$150,000 () offered by the studio. Paramount would go on to license the series to television syndicators worldwide. NBC's remaining broadcast and distribution rights eventually returned to Paramount and Roddenberry sometime before 1986, which coincided with the development of what would become The Next Generation.\n\nAs for Desilu, the studio was acquired by Gulf+Western. It was then reorganized as the television production division of Paramount Pictures, which Gulf+Western had acquired in 1966. Gulf+Western sold its remaining industrial assets in 1989, renaming itself Paramount Communications. Sometime before 1986, Sumner Redstone had acquired a controlling stake of Viacom via his family's theater chain, National Amusements. Viacom was established in 1952 as a division of CBS responsible for syndicating the network's in-house productions, originally called CBS Films. In 1994, Viacom and Paramount Communications were merged. Viacom then merged with its former parent, CBS Corporation, in 1999. National Amusements and the Redstone family increased their stake in the combined company between 1999 and 2005.\n\n","h_score":2172763.1625000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":17157886,"revid":1173723005,"description":"American science fiction media franchise","categories":["American science fiction television series","Fiction about outer space","Mass media franchises introduced in 1966","Paramount Global franchises","Science fantasy","Soft science fiction","Space opera","Star Trek","Television franchises","Television shows adapted into comics","Television shows adapted into films","Television shows adapted into novels","Television shows adapted into video games"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\n\ud83d\ude80 *\"Space: the final frontier.\"* But what if we told you *Star Trek* isn\u2019t just sci-fi\u2014it\u2019s a time machine for *humanity\u2019s* future?

There are around 70 formal coursing clubs in the Republic and two in Northern Ireland, together holding 80\u201385 meetings per year.\n\nThere are several differences between the rules of coursing in Great Britain (where it is regulated by the National Coursing Club) and Irish coursing which has been organised by the Irish Coursing Club since 1916. Because hares are not plentiful in all parts of the island of Ireland, mainly due to modern agricultural practices, coursing clubs are licensed by the Irish government to net 70\u201375 hares for their events. The hares are then transported in boxes to the coursing venue where they are kept for up to eight weeks and trained to be coursed.\n\nInstead of being coursed on open land, the Irish form is run in a secure enclosure over a set distance. Since 1993, Irish Coursing Club rules have made it compulsory for the greyhounds to be muzzled while they chase the hare. After the coursing event, the hares are transported back to where they were netted and re-released into the wild. Whereas the UK form of coursing was run with dogs winning points for their running and turning of the hare, the Republic of Ireland form is run on the basis that the first dog to turn the hare wins. This is denoted by either a red flag or a white flag, indicating the colours of the respective dogs' collars.\n\n","h_score":1861912.8687500001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":1519416,"revid":1162552196,"description":"Competitive activity where sighthounds pursue hares","categories":["Coursing (blood sport)","Hare hunting","Lepus"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Wild Chase: How Hare Coursing Turns Dogs and Dawn into a Spectacle\"**\n\n*Two dozen hounds, a single hare, and a sunrise\u2014this ancient sport pits instinct against speed in a blur of fur and fury.

Of all students, 32% are from the state of New York and 12.2% are international students, from 37 countries. The student body has an average age of 22 years. 57% of students were in the top half of their high school class rank, with 6% in their class's top tenth. The average high school GPA was 3.10. 443 students applied to transfer to the CIA, with a 98% admission rate and 72% enrollment rate for those admitted. 82% of first-year students lived in college housing, while 61% of all undergraduates lived in college housing. 100% of the student body is enrolled as full-time students.\n\nIn 2014, undergraduates were enrolled in five schools: the School of Culinary Arts, the School of Baking and Pastry Arts, the School of Business and Management, the School of Liberal Arts and Food Studies, and the School of Culinary Science and Nutrition. Within the bachelor programs, 83% of student majors are in business management, 10% in culinary science, and 6% are interdisciplinary.\n\nAs of July 2016, associate and bachelor's degree tuitions are \\$14,315 per semester (\\$28,630 per year).

Average earnings from on-campus employment were \\$2,355; the school offers federal and other work study accommodations.\n\n ## Publications\n\nmise en place is the college's newsletter for alumni. The newsletter aims to improve the relationship between the school and its alumni by providing information of interest about the college, its alumni, and students; covering of major issues and events concerning the college; and featuring the leadership and contributions of the school's alumni.\n\nLa Papillote, the school's student newspaper, was established in 1979. The newspaper's stated purpose is to report the news of the institution to the students and other members of the campus community. The newspaper also examines contemporary issues of the industry and other topics. The school's student life department oversees production of the newspaper and fills its editor-in-chief position, which is held by a current student. The paper uses submissions from students, chefs, and outside professionals.\n\n ## Branding\n\nThe CIA has a brand licensing program that sells branded products for foodservice operations and households, and it also publishes cookbooks for professional and home use. The school's general cookbook, The Professional Chef also has an interactive iPad edition that PC Magazine called \"a new frontier for books.\" During the late 1990s, the CIA produced the PBS television show Cooking Secrets of the CIA.\n\n ## Events\n\nBeginning in April 2007, the school hosts the CIA Leadership Awards event annually to honor people for success and achievements in the foodservice industry. The events are organized as fundraising dinners, with CEOs and other prominent members of the industry attending, sponsoring student scholarships. At the Leadership Awards event, the school issues the Augie Award, named for Auguste Escoffier, the French chef and restaurateur who popularized and modernized French cuisine. In 2017, Shep Gordon, Jacques P\u00e9pin, and Martha Stewart were each recipients of the award.\n\nIn 2017, the CIA began hosting its Thomas Keller Golf Classic, a golf outing and fundraiser for student scholarships.

A life-sized statue of Thanos, created by Legacy Effects, was on display at D23 Expo 2017, alongside statues of the Black Order \/ \"Children of Thanos\": Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight, Ebony Maw, and Cull Obsidian. Additionally, Feige, Joe Russo, Downey, Brolin, Bettany, Olsen, Klementieff, Gillan, Bautista, Cheadle, Mackie, Cumberbatch, Stan, Holland, Boseman, Ruffalo, and Hemsworth appeared at D23 Expo to present a clip highlighting the 10 years of MCU films, along with footage from Infinity War. The footage, which was screened exclusively for the panel, received strong audience reaction, with fans \"literally on their feet and jumping as the footage played\". Julia Alexander of Polygon said there was \"quite a bit happening\" in the footage and it \"finally feels like Marvel has made the movie it always wanted to\u2014and the one we've always wanted to see.\" CinemaBlend's Eric Eisenberg said the footage left him \"literally shaking\", with the film looking \"like it could be one of the most epic blockbusters ever created\". Haleigh Foutch for Collider described it as \"dark and dramatic, and utterly epic. It's clear Marvel is trying to do something different here [...] to pay off a decade's worth of narrative and world-building. While it's impossible to tell from two minutes work of footage, it certainly looks like that gamble paid off\". The D23 footage was also shown at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con International. After the two convention presentations, Avengers: Infinity War generated over 90,000 new conversations on social media from July 17 to 23, the third-most during that time period behind Thor: Ragnarok and Justice League (2017), according to Comscore and its PreAct service. Infinity War stayed in third the following week, with over 41,000 new social media conversations, behind Ragnarok and It (2017). By the week of October 16, Infinity War had generated over 679,000 total social media conversations. To promote the film's first teaser trailer, Marvel released a compilation video of some of its previous trailers since Iron Man (2008), \"paired with fan reaction videos to those trailers\". The first teaser for Avengers: Infinity War debuted on Good Morning America on November 29, 2017. Josh Spiegel of The Hollywood Reporter said, \"The most important part of the trailer is how it carefully, deliberately introduces the notion that the Infinity War films are going to function as a passing of the torch, from one set of Avengers to a newer group\".","h_score":1953217.89375,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":44240443,"revid":1173596257,"description":"2018 Marvel Studios film","categories":["2010s American films","2010s English-language films","2010s superhero films","2018 3D films","2018 science fiction action films","4DX films","Alien invasions in films","American 3D films","American crossover films","American science fantasy films","American science fiction action films","American science fiction adventure films","American science fiction war films","American sequel films","American space adventure films","Apocalyptic films","Avengers (film series)","Fiction about intergalactic travel","Filicide in fiction","Films about extraterrestrial life","Films directed by Anthony and Joe Russo","Films scored by Alan Silvestri","Films set in 2018","Films set in Africa","Films set in Edinburgh","Films set in New York (state)","Films set in New York City","Films set in a fictional country","Films set on fictional planets","Films shot at Pinewood Atlanta Studios","Films shot in Atlanta","Films shot in Edinburgh","Films shot in Glasgow","Films shot in Highland (council area)","Films shot in New York City","Films shot in the Philippines","Films using motion capture","Films with screenplays by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely","IMAX films","Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three films","Nanotechnology in fiction","Overpopulation fiction","Superhero crossover films"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Avengers: Infinity War\" \u2013 The Epic That Split the Universe in Half**\n\n*Marvel\u2019s 2018 blockbuster delivered a cosmic gut-punch, redefining superhero storytelling with stakes so high they threatened to break the sky.

Edward had rarely enjoyed his visits to Sandringham, either in his father's time or that of his grandfather. He described a typical dinner at the house in a letter to his then mistress Freda Dudley Ward, dated 26 December 1919; \"it's too dull and boring for words. Christ how any human beings can ever have got themselves into this pompous secluded and monotonous groove I just can't imagine\". In another letter, evenings at the \"big house\"\u2014Edward stayed at York Cottage with his father\u2014were recorded as \"sordidly dull and boring\". His antipathy to the house was unlikely to have been lessened by his late father's will, which was read to the family in the saloon at the house. His brothers were each left \u00a3750,000 while Edward was bequeathed no monetary assets beyond the revenues from the Duchy of Cornwall. A codicil also prevented him from selling the late King's personal possessions; Lascelles described the inheritance as \"the Kingship without the cash\".\n\nEdward's concerns regarding his income led him immediately to focus on the expense associated with running his late father's private homes. Sandringham he described as a \"voracious white elephant\", and he asked his brother, the Duke of York to undertake a review of the management of the estate, which had been costing his father \u00a350,000 annually in subsidies at the time of his death. The review recommended significant retrenchments, and its partial implementation caused considerable resentment among the dismissed staff. After the night of his father's death at Sandringham, Edward spent only one further night of his reign at the house, bringing Wallis Simpson for a shooting party in October 1936. The party was interrupted by a request to meet with prime minister Stanley Baldwin, and having arrived on a Sunday, the King returned to Fort Belvedere the next day. He never returned to Sandringham; and, his attention diverted by the impending crisis arising from his attachment to Simpson, within two months of his only visit to the house as king, he had abdicated. On his abdication, as Sandringham and Balmoral Castle were the private property of the monarch, it was necessary for King George VI to purchase both properties. The price paid, \u00a3300,000, was a cause of friction between the new King and his brother.\n\n","h_score":1920026.8812500001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":977878,"revid":1170522653,"description":"Country house in Norfolk, England, private home of King Charles III","categories":["1870 establishments in England","Carriage museums in England","Country houses in Norfolk","Edward VII","Gardens by Geoffrey Jellicoe","Gardens in Norfolk","Grade II* listed buildings in Norfolk","Grade II* listed parks and gardens in Norfolk","Historic house museums in Norfolk","Houses completed in 1870","Jacobethan architecture","Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale","Royal residences in England","Sandringham, Norfolk","Transport museums in England"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Sandringham House: Where Royalty Kicks Off Their Slippers (and Crowns)\"**\n\n*Britain\u2019s coziest royal retreat\u2014where monarchs trade Buckingham\u2019s pomp for pine-scented fireplaces, and the Queen\u2019s corgis once ruled the halls.

Rainbands can be stratiform or convective, and are generated by differences in temperature. When noted on weather radar imagery, this precipitation elongation is referred to as banded structure. Rainbands within tropical cyclones are curved in orientation. Rainbands of tropical cyclones contain showers and thunderstorms that, together with the eyewall and the eye, constitute a hurricane or tropical storm. The extent of rainbands around a tropical cyclone can help determine the cyclone's intensity.\n\nRainbands spawned near and ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which are able to produce tornadoes. Rainbands associated with cold fronts can be warped by mountain barriers perpendicular to the front's orientation due to the formation of a low-level barrier jet. Bands of thunderstorms can form with sea breeze and land breeze boundaries, if enough moisture is present. If sea breeze rainbands become active enough just ahead of a cold front, they can mask the location of the cold front itself. Banding within the comma head precipitation pattern of an extratropical cyclone can yield significant amounts of rain or snow. Behind extratropical cyclones, rainbands can form downwind of relative warm bodies of water such as the Great Lakes. If the atmosphere is cold enough, these rainbands can yield heavy snow.\n\n ## Extratropical cyclones\n\nRainbands in advance of warm occluded fronts and warm fronts are associated with weak upward motion, and tend to be wide and stratiform in nature. In an atmosphere with rich low level moisture and vertical wind shear, narrow, convective rainbands known as squall lines form generally in the cyclone's warm sector, ahead of strong cold fronts associated with extratropical cyclones. Wider rain bands can occur behind cold fronts, which tend to have more stratiform, and less convective, precipitation. Within the cold sector north to northwest of a cyclone center, in colder cyclones, small scale, or mesoscale, bands of heavy snow can occur within a cyclone's comma head precipitation pattern with a width of 32 kilometres (20 mi) to 80 kilometres (50 mi). These bands in the comma head are associated with areas of frontogensis, or zones of strengthening temperature contrast. Southwest of extratropical cyclones, curved flow bringing cold air across the relatively warm Great Lakes can lead to narrow lake-effect snow bands which bring significant localized snowfall.\n\n ### Narrow cold-frontal rainband\n\nA narrow cold-frontal rainband (NCFR) is a characteristic of particularly sharp cold frontal boundaries. These can usually be seen very easily on satellite photos. NCFRs are typically accompanied by strong gusty winds and brief but intense rainfall. Convection may or may not occur depending on the stability of the air mass being lifted by the front. Such fronts usually are also marked by a sharp wind shift and temperature drop.\n\n ## Tropical cyclones\n\nRainbands exist in the periphery of tropical cyclones, which point towards the cyclone's center of low pressure. Rainbands within tropical cyclones require ample moisture and a low level pool of cooler air. Bands located 80 kilometres (50 mi) to 150 kilometres (93 mi) from a cyclone's center migrate outward. They are capable of producing heavy rains and squalls of wind, as well as tornadoes, particularly in the storm's right-front quadrant.\n\nSome rainbands move closer to the center, forming a secondary, or outer, eyewall within intense hurricanes. Spiral rainbands are such a basic structure to a tropical cyclone that in most tropical cyclone basins, use of the satellite-based Dvorak technique is the primary method used to determine a tropical cyclone's maximum sustained winds. Within this method, the extent of spiral banding and difference in temperature between the eye and eyewall is used to assign a maximum sustained wind and a central pressure. Central pressure values for their centers of low pressure derived from this technique are approximate.\n\nDifferent programs have been studying these rainbands, including the Hurricane Rainband and Intensity Change Experiment.\n\n ## Forced by geography\n\nConvective rainbands can form parallel to terrain on its windward side, due to lee waves triggered by hills just upstream of the cloud's formation. Their spacing is normally 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) to 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) apart. When bands of precipitation near frontal zones approach steep topography, a low-level barrier jet stream forms parallel to and just prior to the mountain ridge, which slows down the frontal rainband just prior to the mountain barrier. If enough moisture is present, sea breeze and land breeze fronts can form convective rainbands. Sea breeze front thunderstorm lines can become strong enough to mask the location of an approaching cold front by evening. The edge of ocean currents can lead to the development of thunderstorm bands due to heat differential at this interface. Downwind of islands, bands of showers and thunderstorms can develop due to low level wind convergence downwind of the island edges. Offshore California, this has been noted in the wake of cold fronts.","h_score":1892940.09375,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":2269568,"revid":1170309896,"description":"Cloud and precipitation structure","categories":["Extratropical cyclones","Mesoscale meteorology","Precipitation","Storm","Tropical cyclone meteorology","Weather hazards"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"What Is a Rainband?

They form when warm, moist air rises rapidly, condensing into clouds and releasing heavy rainfall. \"These bands can stretch hundreds of miles but are typically only 10\u201320 miles wide,\" explains meteorologist Dr. Lisa Chen of the National Weather Service.\n\n---\n\n### **Why They Matter for Weather Forecasting**\nRainbands are critical for predicting severe weather, including flash flooding and tornadoes. Their movement and intensity are tracked using radar and satellite data to issue timely warnings. \"The most dangerous bands often wrap around a storm\u2019s center, dumping extreme rainfall in short periods,\" notes hydrologist Mark Reynolds, who studies flood risks.\n\n---\n### **Key Differences from Other Storm Features**\nUnlike the eyewall (a storm\u2019s most intense core), rainbands are less organized but can still cause localized damage. They may also appear in non-tropical systems, such as nor\u2019easters, where they contribute to prolonged downpours.\n\n---\n**As climate patterns shift, understanding rainband behavior will grow more urgent for disaster preparedness.**"}

The tour was not expected to break even until the conclusion of the second leg. When the tour was announced, U2 guitarist The Edge said of the show's design: \"It's hard to come up with something that's fundamentally different, but we have, I think, on this tour. Where we're taking our production will never have been seen before by anybody, and that's an amazing thing to be able to say. For a band like U2 that really thrives on breaking new ground, it's a real thrill.\" Lead singer Bono said the design was intended to overcome the staid traditional appearance of outdoor concerts where the stage was dominated by speaker stacks on either side: \"We have some magic, and we've got some beautiful objects we're going to take around the world, and we're inside that object.\" He also said that the group's goal was for the show to not be too choreographed. Williams said the goal is to establish a physical proximity: \"The band is just sitting in the palm of the audience's hand.\" At the conclusion of the tour, the intent was to leave the three structures in different parts of the globe and turn them into permanent concert venues. An auction of the stages was planned following the last concert. In April 2018, it was announced that the Loveland Living Planet Aquarium in Utah had reached a deal to permanently install one of the claw stages on its expanded campus; the structure was planned to be fully assembled by July 2019. The transforming video screen was designed by Mark Fisher in a collaboration with Chuck Hoberman and Frederic Opsomer. The screen was fabricated by Opsomer's company Innovative Designs of Belgium, using LED pixels manufactured by Barco. The screen was purchased and rented to the tour by XL Video. It is made up of elongated hexagonal segments mounted on a multiple pantograph system, which enables it to \"open up\" or spread apart vertically as an effect during the concerts. The video screen is composed of over one million pieces: 411,000 pixels, 320,000 fasteners, 150,000 machined pieces, and 30,000 cables are needed to create the visual display at each concert. The screen is mounted on a cabled pulley system to enable the entire screen and pantograph system to move lower and closer to the band. The automation for the screen deployment was provided by Kinesys UK. The LED segments of the screen are weather-resistant. U2 announced that it would purchase carbon offsets to take into consideration the environmental impact of the large production, which has been estimated to be up to 65,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide; approximately the same amount that would be emitted in flying a passenger plane 34 million miles. In addition to the carbon offsets, the band also set up a page on PickupPal so that people could carpool to concerts in an attempt to lower the carbon footprint. Additionally they launched a fan travel carbon offset program in partnership with Offset Options. Most of the carbon emissions are a result of transporting the three stage structures across Europe and North America. An environmental consultant to carbonfootprint.com noted that to offset the tour's 2009 emissions, the band would have to plant over 20,000 trees. In an interview with BBC Radio, The Edge reiterated that U2 were offsetting their carbon emissions, also stating, \"We'd love to have some alternative to big trucks bringing the stuff around but there just isn't one.\" Load-out of the massive set from venues took as much as 3+1\u20442 days. Sound and light equipment was packed into the fleet of trucks first during the four hours following the concert; the remainder of the time was spent deconstructing the steel structures making up the stage using four cranes. The extensive amount of time it took to assemble and disassemble the stage interfered with the development of the schedule for the 2010 Major League Baseball season, due to U2 scheduling shows at four MLB stadiums: O.co Coliseum in Oakland, Angel Stadium in Anaheim, Rogers Centre in Toronto, and Busch Stadium in St. Louis. U2 was also forced to reschedule what would have been their final Giants Stadium concert, when the NFL changed the start time of a New York Jets game, and load-out time from the concert a day and a half prior would have been insufficient.","h_score":1919395.8875000002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":21844820,"revid":1173317171,"description":"2009\u201311 concert tour by U2","categories":["2009 concert tours","2010 concert tours","2011 concert tours","Concert tours of Africa","Concert tours of Australia","Concert tours of Canada","Concert tours of Europe","Concert tours of France","Concert tours of Germany","Concert tours of Ireland","Concert tours of Mexico","Concert tours of New Zealand","Concert tours of North America","Concert tours of Oceania","Concert tours of South Africa","Concert tours of South America","Concert tours of the United Kingdom","Concert tours of the United States","U2 concert tours"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"U2\u2019s 360\u00b0 Tour: How a Giant Stage Redefined Live Music Forever\"**\n\n*For three years, a floating fortress of steel and sound redefined rock \u2018n\u2019 roll\u2014proving that bigger isn\u2019t just better, it\u2019s revolutionary.*\n\n---\n\n**A Stage That Stood Like a Skyscraper**\nU2\u2019s *360\u00b0 Tour* (2009\u20132011) wasn\u2019t just a show\u2014it was a *monument*.

His first concept drawings were made in early 1998, and by 1999 his design had started to look more like the building it is today. Construction began on 25 February 2002. The main contractor was Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd, Kelsey Roofing Industries Ltd was the roofing contractor, and Carr and Angier were theatre consultants. Other contractors included Stent (foundations), Swansea Institute of Higher Education, now part of University of Wales Trinity Saint David (glass), GH James Cyf (stonemasonry), Rimex (stainless steel), Alfred McAlpine (slate), Coed Cymru (wood), Ann Catrin Evans (door furniture) and Amber Hiscott (etchings on glass walls). The architect's concept was a building that expressed \"Welshness\" and was instantly recognisable. The building was designed to reflect many different parts of Wales with local Welsh materials that dominate its history: slate, metal, wood and glass. Many of the materials used come from Wales, including 1,350 tonnes of Welsh slate. 300,000 concrete blocks and a million metres of electric cable were also used in construction. Slate The exterior of the building is clad in multi-coloured slate collected from Welsh quarries. Narrow windows are built into the layers of slate to give the impression of rock strata in sea cliffs. The purple slate came from the Penrhyn Quarry, the blue from Cwt y Bugail Quarry, the green from the Nantlle Valley, the grey from Llechwedd quarry, and the black from the Corris Quarry. > I always loved going to Ogmore and Southerndown. I thought the cliffs there looked like a building anyway. A building capable of withstanding the roughest weather for hundreds of years. The older they get, the better they look. I wondered if it would be possible to make a building which had the same qualities as these magnificent cliffs. To do that I needed a lot of stone. Normal stone for buildings has to be specially cut into blocks; it takes a long time to make and costs a fortune. But in north Wales the historic slate industry has left behind whole mountains of waste stone that no-one wants. This was stone cut from the mountainside for nearly two hundred years but which wasn't good enough to make roof slates. Over 90% was thrown away. But it was ideal for making walls like the one I had in mind... \u2014architect Jonathan Adams Metal The WMC's main feature, the bronze coloured dome which covers the Donald Gordon Theatre, is clad in steel that was treated with copper oxide. It was designed to withstand the weather conditions on the Cardiff Bay waterfront and to look increasingly better with age. The architect, Jonathan Adams, decided not to use copper and aluminium as they would both change colour with age and weather conditions.","h_score":1863653.7875000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":705606,"revid":1171897906,"description":"Arts centre in Cardiff Bay, Wales","categories":["2004 establishments in Wales","Arts centres in Cardiff","BBC Cymru Wales","Buildings and structures celebrating the third millennium","Buildings and structures completed in 2004","Dance venues in Wales","Exhibition and conference centres in Wales","Landmarks in Cardiff","Music venues in Cardiff","Opera houses in Wales","Percy Thomas buildings","Performing arts centres in Wales","Theatres in Cardiff","Tourist attractions in Cardiff"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Wales Millennium Centre: A Cultural Landmark Shaping Cardiff\u2019s Identity**\n\n*Cardiff\u2019s iconic arts hub turns 25, celebrating its role as a global symbol of Welsh creativity\u2014while facing challenges to sustain its future.*\n\n---\n\n### **A Vision for the 21st Century**\nOpened in 2004, the Wales Millennium Centre (WMC) was designed by architect Jonathan Adams to blend Welsh heritage with modern innovation.

Contemporaneous colleagues were often terrified of playing against Chamberlain. Russell regularly feared being embarrassed by Chamberlain, and Walt Frazier called his dominance on the court \"comical\". Chamberlain holds numerous official NBA all-time records. Former teammate Billy Cunningham said, \"The NBA Guide reads like Wilt's personal diary\". He was a scoring champion, all-time top rebounder, and accurate field-goal shooter. He led the NBA in scoring seven times, field-goal percentage nine times, minutes played eight times, rebounding eleven times, and assists once. Chamberlain is most remembered for his 100-point game, which is widely considered one of basketball's greatest records. Decades after his record, many NBA teams did not average 100 points. In high school and college, Chamberlain was Mr. Basketball USA, NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player in 1957, and twice consensus first-team All-American in 1957 and 1958. His number 13 jersey was retired by the Kansas Jayhawks, Harlem Globetrotters, Golden State Warriors, Philadelphia 76ers, and Los Angeles Lakers. Chamberlain won two NBA championships, four regular-season Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards, the Rookie of the Year award, one Finals MVP award, and one All-Star Game MVP award, and was selected to 13 All-Star Games and 10 All-NBA Teams\u2014seven First and three Second teams. He also twice made All-Defensive First Team. During his NBA career, Chamberlain committed few fouls despite his rugged play in the post, and he never fouled out of a regular-season or playoff game in his 14-year NBA career. His career average was two fouls per game despite having averaged 45.8 minutes per game over his career. He had five seasons in which he committed fewer than two fouls per game, and a career-low of 1.5 fouls during the 1962 season, in which he also averaged 50.4 points per game. His fouls per 36 minutes\u2014a statistic that is used to compare players who average vastly different minutes\u2014was 1.6 per game. Chamberlain's game evolved during his playing career. Chamberlain's Lakers coach Bill Sharman said, \"First he was a scorer. Then he was a rebounder and assist man. Then with our great Laker team in 1972, he concentrated on the defensive end.\" During his two-championship seasons, Chamberlain led the league in rebounding while his scoring decreased. During his first championship season, his assists also increased, recording two consecutive seasons with eight assists per game, and winning one assist title. By 1971\u201372, at age 35 and running less, his game was averaging only nine shots per game compared to the 40 in his record-setting 1961\u201362 season. During Chamberlain's time, defensive statistics like blocks and steals had not yet been recorded. According to 1960s Sixers general manager Jack Ramsay, \"Harvey [Pollack] said he used to tell one of his statisticians to keep track of Wilt's blocks in big games ... One night, they got up to 25\". Reported data for 112 games played by Chamberlain for the Lakers in the 1970s shows he averaged 8.8 blocks per game. For his feats, Chamberlain was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1978, named part of the NBA 35th Anniversary Team in 1980, one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996, and was ranked 13th in ESPN's list \"Top North American Athletes of the Century\" in 1999. In 2007, ESPN rather Chamberlain the second-best center of all time by behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and was ranked second in Slam's \"Top 50 NBA Players of All-Time in NBA History\" in 2009, and sixth in ESPN's list of the top 74 NBA players of all time in 2020, and the third-best center of all-time behind Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Russell. In 2022, Chamberlain was ranked fifth in ESPN's list of the NBA 75th Anniversary Team, and sixth in a similar list by The Athletic. ### Rule changes\n\nPart of Chamberlain's impact on basketball is his direct responsibility for several rule changes in the NBA, including a widening of the lane to try to keep big men more distant from the basket, the instituting of offensive goaltending, a ban on dunking to convert free throws, and a revision of rules governing inbounding the ball, such as making it illegal to inbound the ball over the backboard. In basketball history, pundits have stated the only other player who forced such a massive change of rules is 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m) Minneapolis Lakers center George Mikan, who played a decade before Chamberlain and also caused many rule changes designed to thwart dominant centers, such as a widening the lane and defensive goaltending.\n\n","h_score":1992592.8062500001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":255645,"revid":1166655654,"description":"American basketball player (1936\u20131999)","categories":["1936 births","1999 deaths","African-American basketball coaches","African-American basketball players","African-American volleyball players","All-American college men's basketball players","American Basketball Association announcers","American men's basketball players","American men's volleyball players","Basketball coaches from Pennsylvania","Basketball players from Philadelphia","Centers (basketball)","Harlem Globetrotters players","Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball players","Los Angeles Lakers players","Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductees","National Basketball Association All-Stars","National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award winners","National Basketball Association broadcasters","National Basketball Association players with retired numbers","Pennsylvania Republicans","People from Bel Air, Los Angeles","Philadelphia 76ers players","Philadelphia Warriors draft picks","Philadelphia Warriors players","Player-coaches","San Diego Conquistadors coaches","San Francisco Warriors players","Track and field athletes from Pennsylvania","Track and field people from California","Wilt Chamberlain"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Wilt the Stilt: How a 7-Foot Giant Redefined Basketball\u2014and Defied Gravity\"**\n\n*From 100-point games to unmatched dominance, Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s career was a high-flying defiance of limits\u2014on and off the court.*\n\n---\n\n**The Unstoppable Force**\nWilt Chamberlain wasn\u2019t just a player; he was a force of nature.

It was chosen as a regional center instead of the more prominent Phoenician cities of Tyre and Sidon, which had a history of belligerence against Rome. Beirut was first mentioned in writing as a major center for the study of law in the 239 works of Gregory Thaumaturgus, the bishop of Neo-Caesarea. Other early written sources do not mention when the law school was established, and the date is much debated among modern historians and scholars. Edward Gibbon suggested its founding may have been directed by locally born Emperor Alexander Severus, who reigned during AD 222\u2013235; this hypothesis had been supported by Gilles M\u00e9nage, a late 17th-century French scholar. Italian jurist Scipione Gentili, however, attributed the school's foundation to Augustus, while 19th-century German theologian Karl Hase advocated its establishment shortly after the victory at Actium (31 BC). Adolf Friedrich Rudorff dated it to the reign of Hadrian, while Franz Peter Bremer suggested that it opened around 200, based on Thaumaturgus. Theodor Mommsen linked the establishment of the law school in Beirut with the need for jurists, since the city was chosen to serve as a repository for Roman imperial edicts concerning the eastern provinces. After arriving in Beirut, these were translated into Greek, published and archived. This function was first recorded in 196 AD, the date of the earliest constitutions contained in the Gregorian Codex, but the city is thought to have served as a repository since earlier times. The proximity of the repository to the law school allowed the Beiruti jurists to consult archived documents and for students to learn of the most recent imperial decrees\u2014an advantage that the law schools of Caesarea Maritima and Alexandria lacked. The 3rd-century emperors Diocletian and Maximian issued constitutions exempting the students of the law school of Beirut from compulsory service in their hometowns. In the 4th century, the Greek rhetorician Libanius reported that the school attracted young students from affluent families and deplored the school's instructional use of Latin, which was gradually abandoned in favor of Greek in the course of the century. By the 5th century, Beirut had established its leading position and repute among the Empire's law schools; its teachers were highly regarded and played a chief role in the development of legal learning in the East to the point that they were dubbed \u201cecumenical masters\u201d. From 425, the law school of Constantinople became a rival center of law study and was the only school, along with Beirut's, to be maintained after Justinian I closed those of Alexandria, Caesarea Maritima and {{Athens in 529 because their teachings contradicted with Christian faith. On July 9, 551, the Phoenician coastal cities were devastated by a high-magnitude earthquake. In Beirut the earthquake was followed by a tsunami and a fire that obliterated the city. In the aftermath, 30,000 people lost their lives, including many students from abroad. Justinian allocated funds to rebuild Beirut, and the law school was temporarily moved to the southern Phoenician city of Sidon, pending reconstruction; the best teachers, however, moved to Constantinople. Misfortune hit Beirut again in 560 AD when a massive fire ravaged the recovering city. The law school was not reopened, and all prospect for its return was abandoned with the Arab conquest in 635 AD. ## Academia\n\nThe study course at the law school of Beirut was restricted to Roman law; it did not cover the local laws of the province of Phoenicia. Ancient texts provide an idea of the curriculum, the teaching method, the course languages and its duration.\n\n ### Preparatory studies\n\nPotential students were expected to have undergone grammar, rhetoric and encyclopedic sciences studies. Another prerequisite was the mastery of Greek and Latin, given that the classical legal references and imperial constitutions used in the teaching program were written in Latin. The aspirants could pursue their preparatory studies in public schools or have private tutors.\n\n","h_score":1896431.84375,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":38898977,"revid":1170052752,"description":"Ancient school of Roman law, to 551 AD","categories":["Buildings and structures demolished in the 6th century","Byzantine law","Demolished buildings and structures in Lebanon","Former buildings and structures in Lebanon","History of Beirut","Jurisprudence","Legal history","Roman law","Roman sites in Lebanon"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Ancient Law School of Berytus: A 1,600-Year-Old Foundation of Modern Jurisprudence**\n\n*Established in 530 CE, the Law School of Berytus (modern-day Beirut) became the world\u2019s first dedicated university faculty, shaping legal education for centuries.

Marvel Studios formed a partnership with Lexus on the film, with the 2018 Lexus LC being featured in it. The partnership produced a graphic novel, Black Panther: Soul of a Machine, which was released in December 2017 from writers Fabian Nicieza, Geoffrey Thorne, and Chuck Brown; a concept coupe from Lexus inspired by the character; and a Super Bowl LII commercial featuring Boseman, Gurira and Wright, which had 4.3 million views on social media after its Super Bowl airing, according to RelishMix.

The Ju 87 C was intended to be a dive and torpedo bomber for the Kriegsmarine. The type was ordered into prototype production and available for testing in January 1938. Testing was given two months and was to begin in February and end in April 1938. The prototype V10 was to be a fixed wing test aircraft, while the following V11 would be modified with folding wings. The prototypes were Ju 87 B-0 airframes powered by Jumo 211 A engines. Owing to delays, the V10 was not completed until March 1938. It first flew on 17 March and was designated Ju 87 C-1. On 12 May, the V11 also flew for the first time. By 15 December 1939, 915 arrested landings on dry land had been made. It was found that the arresting gear winch was too weak and had to be replaced. Tests showed the average braking distance was 20\u201335 metres (66\u2013115 ft). The Ju 87 V11 was designated C-0 on 8 October 1938. It was fitted out with standard Ju 87 C-0 equipment and better wing-folding mechanisms. The \"carrier Stuka\" was to be built at the Weserflug Company's Lemwerder plant between April and July 1940.\n\nAmong the \"special\" equipment of the Ju 87 C was a two-seat rubber dinghy with a flare gun, signal ammunition and other emergency supplies. A quick fuel dump mechanism and two inflatable 750 L (200 US gal) bags in each wing and a further two 500 L (130 US gal) bags in the fuselage enabled the Ju 87 C to remain afloat for up to three days in calm seas. On 6 October 1939, with the war already underway, 120 of the planned Ju 87 Tr(C)s on order at that point were cancelled. Despite the cancellation, the tests continued using catapults. The Ju 87 C had a takeoff weight of 5,300 kg (11,700 lb) and a speed of 133 km\/h (83 mph) on departure. The Ju 87 could be launched with a SC 500 kg (1,100 lb) bomb and four SC 50 kg (110 lb) bombs under the fuselage. The C-1 was to have two MG 17s mounted in the wing with a MG 15 operated by the rear gunner. On 18 May 1940, production of the C-1 was switched to the R-1.\n\nKnown prototypes\n\n- Ju 87 V10: Registration D-IHFH (changed to Stammkennzeichen of TK+HD). W.Nr 4928.

The film started filming in Toronto in February 2014, and was released in October 2015. He starred as Robert Laing in High-Rise (2015), based on J. G. Ballard's novel of the same name and directed by Ben Wheatley. In January 2014, Hiddleston became a spokesperson for Jaguar Cars in their \"Good to be Bad\" ad campaign featuring British actors in villain-themed commercials to promote Jaguar's new models. The first commercial of the campaign, titled \"Rendezvous\", first aired during the 2014 Super Bowl and featured Hiddleston along with Mark Strong and Ben Kingsley. Hiddleston starred in another commercial in the campaign, titled \"The Art of Villainy\" in April of the same year. It was released on YouTube, promoting the F-Type coupe. It was announced in June 2014 that Hiddleston would portray country music singer Hank Williams in the 2015 biopic I Saw the Light, based on the 1994 biography. The film was directed by Marc Abraham, and was first shown in the Special Presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. The film was released on 25 March 2016, by Sony Pictures Classics. While the film wasn't well-received, Hiddleston's performance was widely praised by critics. Stephanie Zacharek of Time magazine called him \"magnificent\" adding that \"he honors Williams' greatness but also wriggles beyond it.\" Hiddleston was one of the narrators in the 2015 documentary Unity directed by Shaun Monson. He appeared as Jonathan Pine in the 2016 television mini-series The Night Manager based on the espionage and detective novel of the same name by John le Carr\u00e9. The series started filming in Spring 2015 and aired on BBC and AMC with Hugh Laurie also starring. Ben Travers of IndieWire noted that he carried the role of Pine from start to finish, \"with an admirable determination and aptly unbreakable constitution.\" For his performance in the series he was nominated for several awards, including two Primetime Emmy Awards and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. In early 2017, Hiddleston expressed his will to take a long break from work, and his desire to work again in theatre. Later the same year, he starred in Legendary Pictures' King Kong film, Kong: Skull Island. Released on 10 March, and directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, the film was a commercial success, earning over \\$566 million worldwide and received generally positive reviews. In September 2017, he played the title character in a limited run of William Shakespeare's Hamlet directed by Kenneth Branagh.

For the first time, the show's songs fulfilled a specific purpose and was related to its curriculum. Cooney observed in her initial report that children had an \"affinity for commercial jingles\", so many of the show's songs were like television advertisements.\n\nTo attract the best composers and lyricists, and to encourage them to compose more music for the series, the CTW allowed songwriters to retain the rights to the songs they wrote. For the first time in children's television, the writers earned lucrative profits, which as Davis reported, \"helped the show sustain the level of public interest in the show\". Scriptwriters often wrote their own lyrics to accompany their scripts. Songwriters of note were Joe Raposo, Jeff Moss, Christopher Cerf, Tony Geiss, and Norman Stiles. Many of the songs written for Sesame Street have become what writer David Borgenicht termed \"timeless classics\". These songs included \"Can You Tell Me How to Get to Sesame Street?\", \"I Love Trash\", \"Rubber Duckie\", \"Bein' Green\", and \"Sing\". Many Sesame Street songs were recorded by well-known artists such as Barbra Streisand, Lena Horne, Dizzy Gillespie, Paul Simon, and Jose Feliciano. By 2019, there were 180 albums of Sesame Street music produced.\n\nThe show's first album, Sesame Street Book & Record, recorded in 1970, was a major success and won a Grammy Award. Parade Magazine reported in 2019 that the show's music had been honored with 11 children's Grammys.

In June the brothers took a larger flat at 54 rue Lepic. In Paris, Vincent painted portraits of friends and acquaintances, still life paintings, views of Le Moulin de la Galette, scenes in Montmartre, Asni\u00e8res and along the Seine. In 1885 in Antwerp he had become interested in Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints and had used them to decorate the walls of his studio; while in Paris he collected hundreds of them. He tried his hand at Japonaiserie, tracing a figure from a reproduction on the cover of the magazine Paris Illustre, The Courtesan or Oiran (1887), after Keisai Eisen, which he then graphically enlarged in a painting. After seeing the portrait of Adolphe Monticelli at the Galerie Delareybarette, Van Gogh adopted a brighter palette and a bolder attack, particularly in paintings such as his Seascape at Saintes-Maries (1888). Two years later, Vincent and Theo paid for the publication of a book on Monticelli paintings, and Vincent bought some of Monticelli's works to add to his collection. Van Gogh learned about Fernand Cormon's atelier from Theo. He worked at the studio in April and May 1886, where he frequented the circle of the Australian artist John Russell, who painted his portrait in 1886. Van Gogh also met fellow students \u00c9mile Bernard, Louis Anquetin and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec \u2013 who painted a portrait of him in pastel. They met at Julien \"P\u00e8re\" Tanguy's paint shop, (which was, at that time, the only place where Paul C\u00e9zanne's paintings were displayed). In 1886, two large exhibitions were staged there, showing Pointillism and Neo-impressionism for the first time and bringing attention to Georges Seurat and Paul Signac. Theo kept a stock of Impressionist paintings in his gallery on boulevard Montmartre, but Van Gogh was slow to acknowledge the new developments in art. Conflicts arose between the brothers. At the end of 1886 Theo found living with Vincent to be \"almost unbearable\". By early 1887, they were again at peace, and Vincent had moved to Asni\u00e8res, a northwestern suburb of Paris, where he got to know Signac. He adopted elements of Pointillism, a technique in which a multitude of small coloured dots are applied to the canvas so that when seen from a distance they create an optical blend of hues. The style stresses the ability of complementary colours \u2013 including blue and orange \u2013 to form vibrant contrasts. While in Asni\u00e8res Van Gogh painted parks, restaurants and the Seine, including Bridges across the Seine at Asni\u00e8res. In November 1887, Theo and Vincent befriended Paul Gauguin who had just arrived in Paris. Towards the end of the year, Vincent arranged an exhibition alongside Bernard, Anquetin, and probably Toulouse-Lautrec, at the Grand-Bouillon Restaurant du Chalet, 43 avenue de Clichy, Montmartre. In a contemporary account, Bernard wrote that the exhibition was ahead of anything else in Paris. There, Bernard and Anquetin sold their first paintings, and Van Gogh exchanged work with Gauguin. Discussions on art, artists, and their social situations started during this exhibition, continued and expanded to include visitors to the show, like Camille Pissarro and his son Lucien, Signac and Seurat. In February 1888, feeling worn out from life in Paris, Van Gogh left, having painted more than 200 paintings during his two years there. Hours before his departure, accompanied by Theo, he paid his first and only visit to Seurat in his studio. ### Artistic breakthrough\n\n","h_score":2272775.2625000002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":32603,"revid":1173824695,"description":"Dutch painter (1853\u20131890)","categories":["1853 births","1890 deaths","1890s suicides","Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Beaux-Arts alumni","Burials in \u00cele-de-France","Dutch Christians","Dutch Protestants","Dutch expatriates in Belgium","Dutch expatriates in France","Dutch expatriates in the United Kingdom","Dutch landscape painters","Dutch male painters","Dutch people with disabilities","Dutch still life painters","Flower artists","Painters who died by suicide","People from Zundert","People of Montmartre","Post-impressionist painters","Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp) alumni","Suicides by firearm in France","Vincent van Gogh"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nA man who painted the sky like fire, cut off his ear, and sold *one* masterpiece in his lifetime. Vincent van Gogh didn\u2019t just see the world\u2014he *felt* it in swirling, electric strokes. Let\u2019s unravel the genius behind the myth. \ud83c\udfa8\n\n---\n\n**2\/10**\nBorn in 1853 to a Dutch Reformed pastor, young Vincent was a dreamer\u2014first a failed art dealer, then a preacher among miners. His letters reveal a soul hungry for meaning: *\"I am seeking, I am striving, I am in it with all my heart.\"*\n\n---\n\n**3\/10**\nAt 27, he picked up a brush *for real*. In just a decade, he created **2,100 works**\u2014including *Starry Night*, *Sunflowers*, and *The Bedroom*. His style? **Post-Impressionism**: bold colors, thick impasto (that\u2019s paint so thick it *stands* off the canvas).\n\n---\n\n**4\/10**\nVan Gogh\u2019s colors weren\u2019t just pretty\u2014they *screamed*. Yellow = emotion, blue = melancholy, red = danger. *The Night Caf\u00e9* (1888) swirls with toxic green and blood-orange, mirroring his spiraling mind. Art as therapy. Art as warning.\n\n---\n\n**5\/10**\nThe ear incident (1888): Often sensationalized, but here\u2019s the truth. After a fight with Gauguin, Vincent\u2014deep in mental illness\u2014cut off part of his *left* ear. He wrapped it, gave it to a woman, then calmly went home. His brother Theo\u2019s support kept him alive.\n\n---\n\n**6\/10**\nDespite his struggles, van Gogh was *obsessed* with nature. He painted cypress trees like flames, wheat fields as alive as oceans. His letters to Theo: *\"I am working with all my might.\"* No self-pity\u2014just raw, relentless creation.\n\n---\n\n**7\/10**\nFun fact: Van Gogh\u2019s *Sunflowers* (1888) were gifts for Gauguin to brighten their shared \"Yellow House.\" Today, they\u2019re worth **$40M+**. The artist? Died penniless, shot by a stray bullet at 37. The ultimate underdog story.\n\n---\n\n**8\/10**\nPosthumous fame? A twist of fate. After his death, Theo (his devoted brother) championed his work. Then, in 1924, a single van Gogh sold for **$300**\u2014a fortune then. Now? His *Portrait of Dr. Gachet* (1890) holds the record: **$82.5M** at auction.\n\n---\n\n**9\/10**\nWhy does van Gogh still move us? Because his art isn\u2019t just *seen*\u2014it\u2019s *felt*. The swirls of *Starry Night*? That\u2019s the universe in motion. The thick brushstrokes? A heartbeat on canvas. He turned pain into something *eternal*.\n\n---\n**10\/10**\nVincent van Gogh died unknown, but his legacy? **Unshakable.** He proved genius isn\u2019t measured in sales or fame\u2014it\u2019s measured in how deeply you *see*. Next time you\u2019re overwhelmed, look at his *Irises*. That\u2019s resilience in petals. \ud83c\udf38 #VanGogh #ArtThatFeels"}

She then moved to the University of Houston Law Center (1978\u20131983), where she became an associate dean in 1980 and obtained tenure in 1981. She taught at the University of Texas School of Law as visiting associate professor in 1981 and returned as a full professor two years later (staying from 1983 to 1987). She was a research associate at the Population Research Center of the University of Texas at Austin from 1983 to 1987 and was also a visiting professor at the University of Michigan in 1985. During this period, Warren also taught Sunday school. Warren's earliest academic work was heavily influenced by the law and economics movement, which aimed to apply neoclassical economic theory to the study of law with an emphasis on economic efficiency. One of her articles, published in 1980 in the Notre Dame Law Review, argued that public utilities were over-regulated and that automatic utility rate increases should be instituted. But Warren soon became a proponent of on-the-ground research into how people respond to laws. Her work analyzing court records and interviewing judges, lawyers, and debtors, established her as a rising star in the field of bankruptcy law. According to Warren and economists who follow her work, one of her key insights was that rising bankruptcy rates were caused not by profligate consumer spending but by middle-class families' attempts to buy homes in good school districts. Warren worked in this field alongside colleagues Teresa A. Sullivan and Jay Westbrook, and the trio published their research in the book As We Forgive Our Debtors in 1989. Warren later recalled that she had begun her research believing that most people filing for bankruptcy were either working the system or had been irresponsible in incurring debts, but that she concluded that such abuse was in fact rare and that the legal framework for bankruptcy was poorly designed, describing the way the research challenged her fundamental beliefs as \"worse than disillusionment\" and \"like being shocked at a deep-down level\". In 2004, she published an article in the Washington University Law Review in which she argued that correlating middle-class struggles with over-consumption was a fallacy. Warren joined the University of Pennsylvania Law School as a full professor in 1987 and obtained an endowed chair in 1990, becoming the William A. Schnader Professor of Commercial Law. In 1992, she taught for a year at Harvard Law School as the Robert Braucher Visiting Professor of Commercial Law. In 1995, Warren left Penn to become Leo Gottlieb Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. In 1996, she became the highest-paid professor at Harvard University who was not an administrator, with a \\$181,300 salary and total compensation of \\$291,876, including moving expenses and an allowance in lieu of benefits contributions. As of 2011, she was Harvard's only tenured law professor who had attended law school at an American public university. Warren was a highly influential law professor. She published in many fields, but her expertise was in bankruptcy and commercial law. From 2005 to 2009, Warren was among the three most-cited scholars in those fields. She began to rise in prominence in 2004 with an appearance on the Dr. Phil show, and published several books including The Two-Income Trap. ### Advisory roles\n\nIn 1995, the National Bankruptcy Review Commission's chair, former congressman Mike Synar, asked Warren to advise the commission. Synar had been a debate opponent of Warren's during their school years. She helped draft the commission's report and worked for several years to oppose legislation intended to severely restrict consumers' right to file for bankruptcy. Warren and others opposing the legislation were not successful; in 2005, Congress passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which curtailed consumers' ability to file for bankruptcy.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2010, Warren was a member of the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) Advisory Committee on Economic Inclusion. She is a member of the National Bankruptcy Conference, an independent organization that advises the U.S. Congress on bankruptcy law, a former vice president of the American Law Institute and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nWarren's scholarship and public advocacy were the impetus for establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2011.''''\n\n ### TARP oversight\n\nOn November 14, 2008, U.S. Senate majority leader Harry Reid appointed Warren to chair the five-member Congressional Oversight Panel created to oversee the implementation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. The panel released monthly oversight reports evaluating the government bailout and related programs. During Warren's tenure, these reports covered foreclosure mitigation, consumer and small business lending, commercial real estate, AIG, bank stress tests, the impact of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) on the financial markets, government guarantees, the automotive industry and other topics.\n\n ### Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\n\nWarren was an early advocate for creating a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The bureau was established by the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law by President Obama in July 2010. In September 2010, Obama named Warren Assistant to the President and Special Advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury on the CFPB to set up the new agency. While liberal groups and consumer advocacy groups urged Obama to formally nominate Warren as the agency's director, financial institutions and Republican members of Congress strongly opposed her, believing she would be an overly zealous regulator. Reportedly convinced that Warren could not win Senate confirmation as the bureau's first director, in January 2012, Obama appointed former Ohio attorney general Richard Cordray to the post in a recess appointment over Republican senators' objections.\n\n ### Political affiliation\n\nA close high-school friend told Politico in 2019 that in high school Warren was a \"diehard conservative\" and that she had since done a \"180-degree turn and an about-face\". One of her colleagues at the University of Texas in Austin said that at university in the early 1980s Warren was \"sometimes surprisingly anti-consumer in her attitude\". Gary L. Francione, who had been a colleague of hers at the University of Pennsylvania, recalled in 2019 that when he heard her speak at the time she was becoming politically prominent, he \"almost fell off [his] chair... She's definitely changed\". Warren was registered as a Republican from 1991 to 1996 and voted Republican for many years. \"I was a Republican because I thought that those were the people who best supported markets\", she has said. But she has also said that in the six presidential elections before 1996 she voted for the Republican nominee only once, in 1976, for Gerald Ford.\n\nWarren has said that she began to vote Democratic in 1995 because she no longer believed that the Republicans were the party who best supported markets, but she has said she has voted for both parties because she believed neither should dominate. According to Warren, she left the Republican Party because it is no longer \"principled in its conservative approach to economics and to markets\" and is instead tilting the playing field in favor of large financial institutions and against middle-class American families.\n\n ## U.S. Senate (2013\u2013present)\n\n ### Elections\n\n","h_score":2085795.8875000002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":290195,"revid":1173893088,"description":"American politician (born 1949)","categories":["1949 births","21st-century American politicians","21st-century American women politicians","American Methodists","American legal scholars","American people of English descent","American people of German descent","American people who self-identify as being of Cherokee descent","American women academics","American women lawyers","American women legal scholars","Articles containing video clips","Candidates in the 2020 United States presidential election","Competitive debaters","Democratic Party United States senators from Massachusetts","Elizabeth Warren","Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences","Female United States senators","Female candidates for President of the United States","Harvard Law School faculty","Living people","Massachusetts Democrats","Members of the American Law Institute","Methodists from Massachusetts","Native American-related controversies","Northwest Classen High School alumni","People of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau","Politicians from Cambridge, Massachusetts","Politicians from Oklahoma City","Progressivism in the United States","Rutgers School of Law\u2013Newark alumni","Rutgers School of Law\u2013Newark faculty","University of Houston alumni","University of Houston faculty","University of Michigan Law School faculty","University of Pennsylvania Law School faculty","University of Texas School of Law faculty"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Senator Elizabeth Warren: The Populist Firebrand Redefining Washington\u2019s Playbook\"**\n\n*Deck:* A Harvard law professor turned political disruptor, Warren has spent two decades exposing corporate greed\u2014first as a consumer advocate, now as a Senate firebrand.

THE WARREN DOCTRINE: CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY AS SPORT**\nWarren\u2019s Senate career is a highlight reel of regulatory jabs: breaking up Big Tech, taxing the ultra-rich, and forcing CEOs to testify under oath. Her *2022 antitrust report* on Amazon, Apple, and Google read like a detective novel\u2014complete with subpoenas and congressional hearings. \"The system isn\u2019t rigged,\" she quipped at a 2023 town hall. \"It\u2019s just *very* well-oiled.\"\n\n---\n**3. 2024: THE COMeback (OR THE COMEUPANCE?)**\nAfter a 2020 presidential campaign that fizzled (thanks, moderation), Warren\u2019s 2024 run is a gamble. Polls show her trailing Biden, but her base\u2014young voters, unions, and the \"angry middle class\"\u2014still treat her like a rock star. The question isn\u2019t if she\u2019ll run; it\u2019s whether Democrats will let her *win*.\n\n---\n*The next move? Watch Warren turn the primary into a referendum: Can America afford its billionaires\u2014or its patience?*"}

Holland next played alongside Daisy Ridley as a young man living on a planet called New World in Chaos Walking, an adaptation of Patrick Ness's best-selling science fiction series of the same name. The film was delayed due to several reshoots in early 2019, which added \\$15 million to its budget, bringing its cost to \\$100 million. Chaos Walking failed to recoup its budget and received poor reviews. David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter found the chemistry between Holland and Ridley lackluster, and Christian Holub of Entertainment Weekly noted his failed attempt to break away from roles similar to Spider-Man. In November 2021, Holland voiced Percy Pig in a series of advertisements for Marks & Spencer's Christmas food specials. The following month, Holland reprised his role as Peter Parker in the sequel Spider-Man: No Way Home. After taking on mature roles in films like Cherry, Holland noted that he found it strange adjusting back to playing Parker, chiefly due to raising his voice pitch and returning to the mindset of a \"na\u00efve, charming teenager\". He described No Way Home as the \"most ambitious standalone superhero movie ever made\". Despite its release during the COVID-19 pandemic, No Way Home quickly emerged as the highest-grossing film of 2021 and the sixth highest-grossing film of all time. It also became the first film since 2019's Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker to earn more than \\$1 billion at the box-office. No Way Home became the highest-rated Spider-Man film on the online database IMDb and the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Wendy Ide of The Guardian wrote that the film \"delivers an overflowing, funnel-web cornucopia of treats for Spider-fans\" and attributed Parker's continuing appeal to \"his endearing, puppyish enthusiasm\". The Times' Kevin Maher opined that Holland \"own[s] every inch of the role\" and \"casts his web and captures your heart\". Discussing his future as Spider-Man after No Way Home, Holland told GQ in 2021 that he was doubtful about reprising the role, especially after he turns 30 in 2026. He expressed a desire to see a live-action Spider-Man film with Miles Morales as the protagonist, whereas Amy Pascal spoke of wanting Holland to continue playing the role. Holland began the following year with an investment in Dogpound gyms, and a starring role as a young Nathan Drake, a charismatic fortune hunter, in the film adaptation of Naughty Dog's Uncharted video game series. In preparation for scenes where his character is bartending, Holland worked shifts at the Chiltern Firehouse, a pub in London. Though the filming was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Holland continued to eat and train for the role. Uncharted polarised critics but Rebecca Rubin of Variety wrote that Holland's star-power likely contributed to its box-office success. In a mixed review for his performance, Brian Tallerico of Roger Ebert's website labelled him miscast, writing that \"Holland has the agility but quite simply lacks the weight and world-weariness needed\" for the role. Holland next executive produced and starred in the Apple TV+ miniseries The Crowded Room (2023), inspired by the 1981 non-fiction novel The Minds of Billy Milligan, in which he played a character based on Billy Milligan. It was met with negative reviews; San Francisco Chronicle's Bob Strauss dismissed it as \"another one of Tom Holland's 'serious' projects that's hard to take seriously\". Holland said that the role proved to be too emotionally taxing for him, and that he would take a year off work to recover.","h_score":2002859.6000000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":26763420,"revid":1171585569,"description":"English actor (born 1996)","categories":["1996 births","21st-century English male actors","Actors from Kingston upon Thames","Actors with dyslexia","BAFTA Rising Star Award winners","British male film actors","English male child actors","English male film actors","English male musical theatre actors","English male stage actors","English male television actors","English male voice actors","English people of Irish descent","English people of Manx descent","English people with disabilities","Living people","Male actors from London","People educated at Wimbledon College","People educated at the BRIT School"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Tom Holland: The Actor Balancing Blockbusters and Mental Health Advocacy**\n\n*From *Spider-Man* to *Uncharted*, Holland has become one of Hollywood\u2019s most recognizable stars\u2014while openly discussing his struggles with anxiety and depression.*\n\n---\n\n### **Rise to Fame**\nTom Holland first gained global attention as *Spider-Man* in Marvel\u2019s *Civil War* (2016), becoming the youngest actor to play the superhero.

The force of 89,000 men moved in six columns, catching the Republic of Korea Army by surprise, resulting in a rout. The smaller South Korean army suffered from widespread lack of equipment, and was unprepared for war. The numerically superior North Korean forces overcame isolated resistance from the 38,000 South Korean soldiers on the frontier before it began moving steadily south. Most of South Korea's forces retreated in the face of the invasion. The North Koreans were well on their way to South Korea's capital of Seoul within hours, forcing the government and its shattered army to retreat further south. News of the invasion quickly spread around the world via ambassadors and correspondents in Korea. Journalists in the United States were reporting on the invasion within five hours of the initial attack, and United States Ambassador to Korea John J. Muccio sent a telegram to the US State Department at 21:26 EST (10:26 KST) June 24. As the combat grew more intense, US Secretary of State Dean Acheson informed US President Harry S. Truman (who had been resting at his home in Independence, Missouri for the weekend), and Secretary-General of the United Nations Trygve Lie of the situation. The attack was particularly troubling to Truman, who likened it to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and to Lie, who was reminded of the Invasion of Norway during World War II. Fearing the attack would spur a World War III, Truman resolved to act as quickly as possible to prevent an escalation of the conflict. Muccio met with Rhee, who informed him the South Korean Army would run out of ammunition within ten days, and would not be able to hold back the invasion on its own. He requested the United Nations and the United States assist South Korea in the conflict. Lie convened the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for its 473rd meeting at 14:00 June 25 in New York City, New York. He began the meeting with a detailed report from the UN Commission on Korea, explained the situation to the delegates, and insisted that the UN take action to restore peace in Korea. According to the UN Commission on Korea, the situation was assuming the character of full-scale warfare. Then, US diplomat Ernest A. Gross gave Muccio's report on the situation. The United States introduced a resolution stating that North Korea's invasion was a breach of peace in violation of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. Gross requested that South Korea's ambassador to the United Nations, Chang Myon, be present for the meeting, which was granted. The Yugoslavian delegate requested that a North Korean diplomat be present as well, but this request was not granted. North Korea was not a member of the UN and had no representation in the organization. Myon read a prepared statement calling the invasion a crime against humanity, and said that as the UN had played a major role in the founding of South Korea, it was their responsibility to help defend it from aggression. The UNSC debated the resolution and made amendments and revisions to its wording before passing it. The Soviet UN ambassador was not present at the UNSC meeting as a result of the Soviet boycott against the UN, rendering the Soviet Union unable to veto resolution 82.","h_score":1928516.8375000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":10378124,"revid":1169798573,"description":"1950 resolution on the Korean War","categories":["1950 United Nations Security Council resolutions","1950 in Korea","1950 in North Korea","1950 in South Korea","June 1950 events","Korean War","Soviet Union and the United Nations","United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning North Korea","United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning South Korea"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\n\ud83d\udea8 *The UNSC just dropped a resolution like a nuclear bomb\u2014except this one was a *diplomatic* detonation.

Due to severe climatic disruptions to their agriculture, Ivatans have developed numerous successful strategies to protect their food supply and way of life.\n\nTraditionally, because of frequent typhoons and drought, they plant root crops able to cope with the environment. These crops include yam, sweet potato, taro, garlic, ginger, and onion, as they ensure higher chances of survival during awry climate conditions. The Ivatan study the behavior of animals, sky color, wind, and clouds to predict the weather. Ivatans usually gather their animals and stay in their houses when they see that the cows take shelter from the payaman (communal pasture) and birds taking refuge in houses or in the ground. A pink sky with an orange hue also heralds a storm.\n\nThe sea is vital to the Ivatan's way of life. They depend on the flying fish (dibang) and dolphinfish (arayu) present on the shores of Batanes in the months of March through May. They have a native delicacy called uvod (the pith of the banana stalk) which is served with the wine palek, on festive occasions such as weddings.Before Spaniards arrived in the Philippines, Ivatans built their houses from cogon grass. These homes were small, well-situated, and designed to protect against strong winds. The Spaniards introduced large-scale production of lime to the Ivatan for the construction of their now-famous stone houses. Meter-thick limestone walls, are designed to protect against the harsh Batanes environment, which is known as a terminal passage of typhoons in the Philippines. The basic cogon grass is still preserved as roofs of their houses, thickly constructed to withstand strong winds. These houses are comparable to the white houses in New Zealand, Ireland, and the Scottish Highlands. Pre-colonial Ivatans also constructed fortified hills protected by sheer embankments known as ijang (or idjang).\n\nOne of the endemic clothing of the Ivatans is the vakul. A vakul is a headgear designed to protect the wearer from sun and rain. It is made from vuyavuy palm fiber.\n\nThe Ivatans have three folk song styles: the laji, the kanta, and the kalusan. The laji are ancient lyrical songs that are supposed to be sung when they are merry or just finished work. The kalusan is sung during work.\n\nThe Ivatan have legends that are called kabbata. They have the rawod, chants that chronicle the adventures of the Ivatan's forefathers as they escape a disaster.\n\n ## Indigenous Ivatan religion\n\n","h_score":1873504.8625,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":9769131,"revid":1171278482,"description":"Austronesian ethnolinguistic group","categories":["Batanes","Ethnic groups in Luzon","Ethnic groups in the Philippines","History of Batanes"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nImagine a people who live where the ocean *boils*\u2014where volcanoes hum lullabies & the wind carves stories into stone.

Pex Hill is a disused quarry, located to the north of the town. Roman roads by-passed the area but some Roman coins were found where the Ditton railway station stands today. In the 9th century Vikings had invaded the country and Widnes was at the extreme south of the Danelaw. The River Mersey derives its name from the Anglo-Saxon maeres ea, which means boundary river, the boundary being that between the Danelaw and the Saxon kingdom of Mercia. At the beginning of the 20th century it was believed that some earthworks on Cuerdley Marsh had been constructed by the Vikings but an archaeological investigation in the 1930s found nothing to confirm this.\n\nFollowing the Norman conquest of England, William the Conqueror granted the Earldom of Lancaster to Roger the Poitevin who in turn granted the barony of Widnes to Yorfrid. Yorfrid had no sons and his elder daughter married William fitz Nigel, the second Baron of Halton. On Yorfrid's death the barony of Widnes passed to that of Halton. The current St. Luke's, a Norman church, was built in Farnworth. Its date of origin is uncertain but it is likely to be around 1180. In 1500 the South Chapel was added to the church and in 1507 a grammar school was established in Farnworth; both were endowments from Bishop William Smyth. Until the middle of the 19th century the area consisted of the scattered hamlets of Farnworth, Appleton, Ditton, Upton and Woodend. Nearby were the villages of Cronton and Cuerdley.\n\nIn the 1750s the Sankey Canal was constructed. This linked the area of St. Helens with the River Mersey at Sankey Bridges, near Warrington and was in operation by 1757. It was extended to Fiddler's Ferry in 1762 and then in 1833 a further extension to Woodend was opened. In the same year the St Helens and Runcorn Gap Railway was opened. The railway connected St Helens with an area in Woodend which was to become known as Spike Island. The termini of the canal and railway were adjacent and here Widnes Dock, the world's first railway dock, was established. Despite these transport links and the emergence of the chemical industry at nearby Runcorn and elsewhere in the Mersey Valley, the Industrial Revolution did not arrive at Widnes until 14 years later, with the arrival at Spike Island of John Hutchinson.\n\n","h_score":1862475.9187500002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":8239941,"revid":1172711986,"description":"Town in Cheshire, England","categories":["Borough of Halton","Former civil parishes in Cheshire","Towns in Cheshire","Unparished areas in Cheshire","Widnes"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Widnes: Where the River\u2019s Whisper Meets the Factory\u2019s Roar\"**\n\n*This sleepy Cheshire town punches above its weight\u2014with a past steeped in industry, a present buzzing with culture, and a future that\u2019s anything but quiet.*\n\n---\n\n**A Town Built on Black Gold**\nWidnes wasn\u2019t just *any* industrial hub\u2014it was the **oil capital of the world** in the 1800s, when its refineries turned crude into kerosene for lamps that lit Victorian homes.

Damage to the flocculonodular lobe may show up as a loss of equilibrium and in particular an altered, irregular walking gait, with a wide stance caused by difficulty in balancing. Damage to the lateral zone typically causes problems in skilled voluntary and planned movements which can cause errors in the force, direction, speed and amplitude of movements. Other manifestations include hypotonia (decreased muscle tone), dysarthria (problems with speech articulation), dysmetria (problems judging distances or ranges of movement), dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid alternating movements such as walking), impaired check reflex or rebound phenomenon, and intention tremor (involuntary movement caused by alternating contractions of opposing muscle groups). Damage to the midline portion may disrupt whole-body movements, whereas damage localized more laterally is more likely to disrupt fine movements of the hands or limbs. Damage to the upper part of the cerebellum tends to cause gait impairments and other problems with leg coordination; damage to the lower part is more likely to cause uncoordinated or poorly aimed movements of the arms and hands, as well as difficulties in speed. This complex of motor symptoms is called ataxia.\n\nTo identify cerebellar problems, neurological examination includes assessment of gait (a broad-based gait being indicative of ataxia), finger-pointing tests and assessment of posture. If cerebellar dysfunction is indicated, a magnetic resonance imaging scan can be used to obtain a detailed picture of any structural alterations that may exist.\n\nThe list of medical problems that can produce cerebellar damage is long, including stroke, hemorrhage, swelling of the brain (cerebral edema), tumors, alcoholism, physical trauma such as gunshot wounds or explosives, and chronic degenerative conditions such as olivopontocerebellar atrophy. Some forms of migraine headache may also produce temporary dysfunction of the cerebellum, of variable severity. Infection can result in cerebellar damage in such conditions as the prion diseases and Miller Fisher syndrome, a variant of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome.\n\n ### Aging\n\nThe human cerebellum changes with age. These changes may differ from those of other parts of the brain. The cerebellum is the youngest brain region (and body part) in centenarians according to an epigenetic biomarker of tissue age known as epigenetic clock: it is about 15 years younger than expected in a centenarian. Further, gene expression patterns in the human cerebellum show less age-related alteration than that in the cerebral cortex. Some studies have reported reductions in numbers of cells or volume of tissue, but the amount of data relating to this question is not very large.\n\n","h_score":2008106.46875,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":50397,"revid":1173671957,"description":"Structure at the rear of the vertebrate brain, beneath the cerebrum","categories":["Cerebellum","Motor system"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Cerebellum: The Brain\u2019s Hidden \u2018Autopilot\u2019 for Movement and More\"**\n\n*This small but mighty brain region fine-tunes everything from walking to learning\u2014yet scientists are still uncovering its full potential.*\n\n---\n\n### **What Is the Cerebellum?**\nThe cerebellum, located at the base of the brain, is a compact structure (about the size of a walnut) responsible for coordinating movement, balance, and posture. Unlike the cerebrum, which handles complex thought, the cerebellum acts as a \"quality control\" center, refining motor commands sent by other brain areas. \"It doesn\u2019t initiate actions, but it ensures they\u2019re smooth and precise\u2014like a conductor for the body\u2019s orchestra,\" explains neuroscientist Dr. Elena Martinez of Harvard Medical School.\n\n---\n\n### **Beyond Movement: The Cerebellum\u2019s Expanding Role**\nResearch increasingly links the cerebellum to cognitive functions, including language, attention, and even emotional regulation. Studies show damage to this area can impair speech timing or disrupt working memory. \"We\u2019re realizing it\u2019s not just a \u2018movement processor\u2019\u2014it\u2019s deeply involved in how we think and interact,\" says cognitive neuroscientist Dr. Raj Patel, whose lab investigates cerebellar contributions to learning.\n\n---\n### **Why It Matters for Health and Tech**\nDysfunction in the cerebellum underlies disorders like ataxia (loss of coordination) and may contribute to autism and dyslexia. Meanwhile, scientists are exploring its potential in brain-computer interfaces, where precise motor control could revolutionize prosthetics or rehabilitation. The more we understand this structure, the closer we get to treating\u2014and even enhancing\u2014human performance.\n\n*The next decade of cerebellar research may redefine how we treat neurological conditions\u2014and even rethink what the brain is capable of.*"}

The two most frequently staged are Manon (1884) and Werther (1892). He also composed oratorios, ballets, orchestral works, incidental music, piano pieces, songs and other music.\n\nWhile still a schoolboy, Massenet was admitted to France's principal music college, the Paris Conservatoire. There he studied under Ambroise Thomas, whom he greatly admired. After winning the country's top musical prize, the Prix de Rome, in 1863, he composed prolifically in many genres, but quickly became best known for his operas. Between 1867 and his death forty-five years later he wrote more than forty stage works in a wide variety of styles, from op\u00e9ra-comique to grand-scale depictions of classical myths, romantic comedies, lyric dramas, as well as oratorios, cantatas and ballets. Massenet had a good sense of the theatre and of what would succeed with the Parisian public. Despite some miscalculations, he produced a series of successes that made him the leading composer of opera in France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nLike many prominent French composers of the period, Massenet became a professor at the Conservatoire. He taught composition there from 1878 until 1896, when he resigned after the death of the director, Ambroise Thomas. Among his students were Gustave Charpentier, Ernest Chausson, Reynaldo Hahn and Gabriel Piern\u00e9.\n\nBy the time of his death, Massenet was regarded by many critics as old-fashioned and unadventurous although his two best-known operas remained popular in France and abroad. After a few decades of neglect, his works began to be favourably reassessed during the mid-20th century, and many of them have since been staged and recorded. Although critics do not rank him among the handful of outstanding operatic geniuses such as Mozart, Verdi and Wagner, his operas are now widely accepted as well-crafted and intelligent products of the Belle \u00c9poque.\n\n ## Biography\n\n","h_score":2004039.71875,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":355236,"revid":1153269693,"description":"French composer (1842\u20131912)","categories":["1842 births","1912 deaths","19th-century French composers","19th-century French male musicians","19th-century classical composers","20th-century French composers","20th-century French male musicians","20th-century classical composers","Academic staff of the Conservatoire de Paris","Belle \u00c9poque","French Romantic composers","French ballet composers","French male classical composers","French opera composers","Grand Officers of the Legion of Honour","Honorary Members of the Royal Philharmonic Society","Male opera composers","Musicians from Saint-\u00c9tienne","Oratorio composers","Prix de Rome for composition","Pupils of Napol\u00e9on Henri Reber"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"1\/10\nJules Massenet (1842\u20131912) was a French composer whose operas defined late 19th-century music.

This work, now known as Admonitions or De institutione morum, was preserved in manuscripts written in the Late Middle Ages. Although scholars debate whether it can actually be attributed to the king or a cleric, most of them agree that it was composed in the first decades of the 11th century.\n\nThe Admonitions argues that kingship is inseparably connected with the Catholic faith. Its author emphasized that a monarch is required to make donations to the Church and regularly consult his prelates, but is entitled to punish clergymen who do wrong. One of its basic ideas was that a sovereign has to cooperate with the \"pillars of his rule\", meaning the prelates, aristocrats, isp\u00e1ns and warriors.\n\n> My dearest son, if you desire to honor the royal crown, I advise, I counsel, I urge you above all things to maintain the Catholic and Apostolic faith with such diligence and care that you may be an example for all those placed under you by God, and that all the clergy may rightly call you a man of true Christian profession.

The settlement is recorded in Domesday Book in 1086 as Cherchefelle and first appears with its modern name in the 1190s. The earliest archaeological evidence for human activity is from the Paleolithic and Neolithic, and during the Roman period, tile-making took place to the north east of the modern centre.\n\nA motte-and-bailey castle was erected in Reigate in the late 11th or early 12th century. It was originally constructed of timber, but the curtain walls were rebuilt in stone about a century later. An Augustinian priory was founded to the south of the modern town centre in the first half of the 13th century. The priory was closed during the Reformation and was rebuilt as a private residence for William Howard, the 1st Baron Howard of Effingham. The castle was abandoned around the same time and fell into disrepair.\n\nDuring the medieval and early modern periods, Reigate was primarily an agricultural settlement. A weekly market began no later than 1279 and continued until 1895. Key crops included oats, hops and flax, but there is no record of rye being grown in the local area. The economy initially declined in the 18th century, as new turnpike roads allowed cheaper goods made outside the town to become available, undercutting local producers. Following the arrival of the railways in the mid-19th century, Reigate began to expand and the sale of much of the priory estate in 1921 released further land for housebuilding.\n\nSince 1974, Reigate has been one of four towns in the borough of Reigate and Banstead and is part of the London commuter belt. The borough council is based at the town hall in Castlefield Road and Surrey County Council has its headquarters at Woodhatch Place. Much of the North Downs, to the north of Reigate, is owned by the National Trust, including Colley Hill, 722 feet (220 m) above ordnance datum (OD) and Reigate Hill 771 feet (235 m) above OD.\n\n ## Toponymy\n\nIn the Domesday Book of 1086, Reigate appears as Cherchefelle and in the 12th century, it is recorded as Crichefeld and Crechesfeld. The name is thought to mean \"open space by the hill or barrow\".\n\nThe name \"Reigate\" first appears in written sources in the 1190s. Similar forms are also recorded in the late medieval period, including Reigata in 1170, Regate in 1203, Raygate in 1235, Rigate in 1344 and Reighgate in 1604. The name is thought to derive from the Old English r\u01e3ge meaning \"roe deer\" and the Middle English gate, which might indicate an enclosure gate or pass through which deer were hunted. It has also been suggested that the \"rei\" element may have evolved from the Middle English ray, meaning a marshland or referring to a stream; this theory is considered unlikely as the Old English form of this word is ree rather than rey.\n\nWoodhatch may derive from the Old English word h\u00e6c meaning \"gate\", and the name may mean \"gate to the wood\". It is possible, in this instance, that the \"wood\" referred to is the Weald. In 1623, a survey of the manor of Reigate noted a \"Bowling Alley lying before the gate of the Tenement called Woodhatch\". Alternatively, the name may derive from that of a local resident: A \"Thomas ate Chert\" is recorded as living at the settlement in the early 14th century and \"Woodhatch\" might instead mean \"woodland of the ate Chert family\".\n\n ## Geography\n\n ### Location and topography\n\nReigate is in central Surrey, around 19 mi (31 km) south of central London and 9 mi (14 km) north of Gatwick Airport. The town is in the Vale of Holmesdale, below the North Downs escarpment. The average elevation in the centre is 80 m (260 ft) above ordnance datum (OD) and the area is drained by the Wallace Brook and its tributaries, which feed the River Mole.\n\n","h_score":1863128.4187500002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":219796,"revid":1173872551,"description":"Town in Surrey, England","categories":["Market towns in Surrey","Reigate","Reigate and Banstead","Towns in Surrey","Unparished areas in Surrey"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Reigate: The Surrey Gem Where History and Hectic London Collide\"**\n\n*Tucked between rolling hills and the capital\u2019s commuter chaos, Reigate is a town where Tudor charm meets modern ambition\u2014yet its future hangs in the balance as development pressures mount.*\n\n---\n\n### **A Town Built on Two Centuries**\nReigate\u2019s cobbled streets whisper of its past: a 12th-century market town, a Civil War battleground, and a Victorian spa retreat. The Priory, a 12th-century ruin, stands as a silent sentinel, while the High Street\u2019s independent shops\u2014from butchers to bookstores\u2014resist the pull of chains. \"This isn\u2019t just a town; it\u2019s a living museum,\" says local historian *Martha Cole*, gesturing to the half-timbered *Dolphin Hotel*, where Charles Dickens once stayed. Yet beneath the period facades, Reigate pulses with energy: a thriving arts scene, a growing tech hub, and a reputation as one of the UK\u2019s most desirable commuter spots.\n\n---\n\n### **The Commuters\u2019 Oasis\u2014With a Price**\nReigate\u2019s allure is undeniable: just 30 minutes from London\u2019s bustle, it offers greenbelts, golf courses, and schools ranked among the best in the country. But that proximity comes at a cost. House prices have soared past \u00a3600,000, pricing out long-time residents, while the town\u2019s narrow roads groan under the weight of 4x4s ferrying city workers. \"We love Reigate, but we\u2019re becoming a bedroom for London\u2014not a home,\" laments *James Whitaker*, a teacher who\u2019s watched three friends relocate to cheaper towns. The town\u2019s identity is caught in the crossfire: a haven for some, a financial fortress for others.\n\n---\n### **The Fight for Reigate\u2019s Soul**\nDevelopers eye the town\u2019s edges, proposing new housing estates and a controversial expansion of the nearby *M25* motorway\u2014projects that could ease pressure or erode Reigate\u2019s character, depending on who you ask. The town council walks a tightrope, balancing growth with preservation, while activists push for more affordable homes and protections for the *North Downs*, a UNESCO-listed landscape. The debate isn\u2019t just about bricks and roads; it\u2019s about what Reigate *should* be. One thing\u2019s certain: the next chapter will be written in the clash between heritage and progress.\n\n*The question isn\u2019t whether Reigate will change\u2014it\u2019s whether it can stay true to itself while doing so.*"}

By this time his trial was largely forgotten in the popular mind, superseded by intervening world events. However, no other account of either Eichmann or National Socialism has aroused so much controversy. Prior to its publication, Arendt was considered a brilliant humanistic original political thinker. However her mentor, Karl Jaspers, warned her about a possible adverse outcome, \"The Eichmann trial will be no pleasure for you. I'm afraid it cannot go well\". On publication, three controversies immediately occupied public attention: the concept of Eichmann as banal, her criticism of the role of Israel and her description of the role played by the Jewish people themselves. Arendt was profoundly shocked by the response, writing to Karl Jaspers \"People are resorting to any means to destroy my reputation ... They have spent weeks trying to find something in my past that they can hang on me\". Now she was being called arrogant, heartless and ill-informed. She was accused of being duped by Eichmann, of being a \"self-hating Jewess\", and even an enemy of Israel. Her critics included The Anti-Defamation League and many other Jewish groups, editors of publications she was a contributor to, faculty at the universities she taught at and friends from all parts of her life. Her friend Gershom Scholem, a major scholar of Jewish mysticism, broke off relations with her, publishing their correspondence without her permission. Arendt was criticized by many Jewish public figures, who charged her with coldness and lack of sympathy for the victims of the Holocaust. Because of this lingering criticism neither this book nor any of her other works were translated into Hebrew until 1999. Arendt responded to the controversies in the book's Postscript. Although Arendt complained that she was being criticized for telling the truth \u2013 \"what a risky business to tell the truth on a factual level without theoretical and scholarly embroidery\" \u2013 the criticism was largely directed to her theorizing on the nature of mankind and evil and that ordinary people were driven to commit the inexplicable not so much by hatred and ideology as ambition, and inability to empathize. Equally problematic was the suggestion that the victims deceived themselves and complied in their own destruction. Prior to Arendt's depiction of Eichmann, his popular image had been, as The New York Times put it \"the most evil monster of humanity\" and as a representative of \"an atrocious crime, unparalleled in history\", \"the extermination of European Jews\". As it turned out Arendt and others were correct in pointing out that Eichmann's characterization by the prosecution as the architect and chief technician of the Holocaust was not entirely credible. While much has been made of Arendt's treatment of Eichmann, Ada Ushpiz, in her 2015 documentary Vita Activa: The Spirit of Hannah Arendt, placed it in a much broader context of the use of rationality to explain seemingly irrational historical events.","h_score":2066176.2375,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":95184,"revid":1173839242,"description":"German-American political theorist and philosopher (1906\u20131975)","categories":["1906 births","1975 deaths","20th-century American essayists","20th-century American historians","20th-century American philosophers","20th-century American women writers","20th-century German historians","20th-century German non-fiction writers","20th-century German philosophers","20th-century German women writers","American Ashkenazi Jews","American Zionists","American agnostics","American ethicists","American political philosophers","American women historians","American women philosophers","Augustine scholars","Columbia University faculty","Exilliteratur writers","Existentialists","Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences","German Ashkenazi Jews","German agnostics","German ethicists","German political philosophers","German women historians","German women philosophers","Gurs internment camp survivors","Hannah Arendt","Heidelberg University alumni","Historians from California","Historians from New York (state)","Historians of communism","Historians of the Holocaust","Intellectual historians","International criminal law scholars","Jewish American historians","Jewish agnostics","Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to the United States","Jewish existentialists","Jewish women writers","Members of the American Academy of Arts and Letters","Members of the German Academy for Language and Literature","Northwestern University faculty","Philosophers of culture","Philosophers of education","Philosophers of history","Philosophers of law","Philosophers of science","Philosophers of technology","Philosophy writers","Political philosophers","Princeton University faculty","Scholars of antisemitism","Social philosophers","The New School faculty","University of California, Berkeley faculty","University of Chicago faculty","University of Marburg alumni","Wesleyan University faculty","Women religious writers","Writers from K\u00f6nigsberg","Yaddo alumni","Yale University faculty"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nHannah Arendt didn\u2019t just *think*\u2014she *watched* the world unravel like a bad play.

They are distinguished from other fish by their elongated rostra, which are thought to enhance electroreception to detect prey. Paddlefish have been referred to as \"primitive fish\" because the Acipenseriformes are among the earliest diverging lineages of ray-finned fish, having diverged from all other living groups over 300 million years ago. Paddlefish are almost exclusively North American and Chinese, both extant and in the fossil record.\n\nEight species are known - six extinct species known only from fossil remains (five from North America, one from China), one extant species, the American paddlefish (Polyodon spathula), which is native to the Mississippi River basin in the U.S., and the Chinese paddlefish (Psephurus gladius), declared extinct in 2022 following a 2019 recommendation that it be declared extinct. The species was last sighted in 2003 in the Yangtze River Basin in China. Chinese paddlefish are also commonly referred to as \"Chinese swordfish\", or \"elephant fish\". The earliest known species is Protopsephurus from the Early Cretaceous (Aptian) of China, dating to around 120 million years ago.\n\nPaddlefish populations have declined dramatically throughout their historic range as a result of overfishing, pollution, and the encroachment of human development, including the construction of dams that have blocked their seasonal upward migration to ancestral spawning grounds.

Some of the profits were invested in the production of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Engineer Alan Parsons received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical for The Dark Side of the Moon, and he went on to have a successful career as a recording artist with the Alan Parsons Project. Although Waters and Gilmour have on occasion downplayed his contribution to the success of the album, Mason has praised his role. In 2003, Parsons reflected: \"I think they all felt that I managed to hang the rest of my career on Dark Side of the Moon, which has an element of truth to it. But I still wake up occasionally, frustrated about the fact that they made untold millions and a lot of the people involved in the record didn't.\"\n\nPart of the legacy of The Dark Side of the Moon is its influence on modern music and on the musicians who have performed cover versions of its songs. It is often seen as a pivotal point in the history of rock music, and comparisons are sometimes made with Radiohead's 1997 album OK Computer, including a premise explored by Ben Schleifer in Speak to Me': The Legacy of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon (2006) that the two albums share a theme that \"the creative individual loses the ability to function in the [modern] world\".\n\nIn a 2018 book about classic rock, Steven Hyden recalls concluding, in his teens, that The Dark Side of the Moon and Led Zeppelin IV were the two greatest albums of the genre, vision quests \"encompass[ing] the twin poles of teenage desire\". They had similarities, in that both albums' cover and internal artwork eschew pictures of the bands in favour of \"inscrutable iconography without any tangible meaning (which always seemed to give the music packaged inside more meaning)\". But whereas Led Zeppelin had looked outward, toward \"conquering the world\" and were known at the time for their outrageous sexual antics on tour, Pink Floyd looked inward, toward \"overcoming your own hang-ups\". In 2013, The Dark Side of the Moon was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n ### Rankings\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon frequently appears on professional rankings of the greatest albums. In 1987, Rolling Stone ranked it the 35th best album of the preceding 20 years. Rolling Stone ranked it number 43 on its 2003 and 2012 lists of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" and number 55 in its 2020 list, Pink Floyd's highest placement. Both Rolling Stone and Q have listed The Dark Side of the Moon as the best progressive rock album.\n\nIn 2006, Australian Broadcasting Corporation viewers voted The Dark Side of the Moon their favourite album. NME readers voted it the eighth-best album in a 2006 poll, and in 2009, Planet Rock listeners voted it the greatest of all time. The album is also number two on the \"Definitive 200\" list of albums, made by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers \"in celebration of the art form of the record album\". It ranked 29th in The Observer's 2006 list of \"The 50 Albums That Changed Music\", and 37th in The Guardian's 1997 list of the \"100 Best Albums Ever\", as voted for by a panel of artists and music critics. In 2014, readers of Rhythm voted it the seventh most influential progressive drumming album. It was voted number 9 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000).\n\nThe album's cover has also been praised by critics and listeners, with VH1 proclaiming it to be the fourth greatest in history.\n\n","h_score":1891401.3687500001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":42634,"revid":1173248036,"description":null,"categories":["1973 albums","Albums produced by David Gilmour","Albums produced by Nick Mason","Albums produced by Richard Wright (musician)","Albums produced by Roger Waters","Albums with cover art by Hipgnosis","Albums with cover art by Storm Thorgerson","Capitol Records albums","EMI Records albums","Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients","Harvest Records albums","Pink Floyd albums","Science fiction concept albums","United States National Recording Registry albums","United States National Recording Registry recordings"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nThe *Dark Side of the Moon* isn\u2019t just a Pink Floyd album\u2014it\u2019s a real astronomical phenomenon.

The near side\u2019s thinner crust allowed lava to flow, creating the maria we see. The far side\u2019s crust stayed intact, preserving older, cratered terrain.\n\n---\n\n**6\/10**\nThe far side was first photographed in 1959 by the Soviet *Luna 3* mission. Before that, its surface was a total mystery\u2014hence the \"dark\" mystique.\n\n---\n\n**7\/10**\nFun fact: The far side has a *mass anomaly* called the South Pole-Aitken Basin\u2014a giant impact crater with a mysterious, dense core.\n\n---\n\n**8\/10**\nChina\u2019s *Chang\u2019e-4* mission (2019) was the first to land on the far side. It revealed a geologically complex, water-ice-rich environment.\n\n---\n\n**9\/10**\nThe far side\u2019s isolation makes it ideal for radio astronomy. No Earth interference = clearer signals from deep space.\n\n---\n\n**10\/10**\nSo, the \"dark side\" isn\u2019t dark\u2014it\u2019s just the side we don\u2019t see.

Its goal was to renovate and restructure the area within Wilson's Arch, the covered area to the left of worshipers facing the Wall in the open prayer plaza, in order to increase access for visitors and for prayer.\n\nThe restoration to the men's section included a Torah ark that can house over 100 Torah scrolls, in addition to new bookshelves, a library, heating for the winter, and air conditioning for the summer. A new room was also built for the scribes who maintain and preserve the Torah scrolls used at the Wall. New construction also included a women's section, overlooking the men's prayer area, so that women could use this separate area to \"take part in the services held inside under the Arch\" for the first time.\n\nOn July 25, 2010, a ner tamid, an oil-burning \"eternal light,\" was installed within the prayer hall within Wilson's Arch, the first eternal light installed in the area of the Western Wall. According to the Western Wall Heritage Foundation, requests had been made for many years that \"an olive oil lamp be placed in the prayer hall of the Western Wall Plaza, as is the custom in Jewish synagogues, to represent the menorah of the Temple in Jerusalem as well as the continuously burning fire on the altar of burnt offerings in front of the Temple,\" especially in the closest place to those ancient flames.\n\nA number of special worship events have been held since the renovation. They have taken advantage of the cover, temperature control, and enhanced security. However, in addition to the more recent programs, one early event occurred in September 1983, even before the modern renovation. At that time U.S. Sixth Fleet Chaplain, Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff was allowed to hold an unusual interfaith service\u2014the first interfaith service ever conducted at the Wall during the time it was under Israeli control\u2014that included men and women sitting together. The ten-minute service included the Priestly Blessing, recited by Resnicoff, who is a Kohen. A Ministry of Religions representative was present, responding to press queries that the service was authorized as part of a special welcome for the U.S. Sixth Fleet.\n\n ## Robinson's Arch area\n\nAt the southern end of the Western Wall, Robinson's Arch along with a row of vaults once supported stairs ascending from the street to the Temple Mount.\n\nThe so-called Isaiah Stone, located under Robinson's Arch, has a carved inscription in Hebrew with a partial and slightly faulty quote from (or paraphrase of) Isaiah 66:14: \"And you will see and your heart will rejoice and their bones like an herb [will flourish]\" (the correct line from Isaiah would read \"...your bones\".) This gave room to various interpretations, some speculating about it being written during a period of hope for Jews. Alternatively, it might be connected to nearby graves. The inscription has tentatively been dated to the 4th-8th century, some extending the possible timespan all the way to the 11th century.\n\n ### Non-Orthodox worship\n\nBecause it does not come under the direct control of the Rabbi of the Wall or the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the site has been opened to religious groups that hold worship services that would not be approved by the Rabbi of the Western Wall or the Ministry of Religious Affairs in the major men's and women's prayer areas against the Wall. The worship site was inaugurated in 2004 and has since hosted services by Reform and Conservative groups, as well as services by the Women of the Wall. A platform has been added in 2013 in order to expand the prayer area.\n\n ## Rabbis of the wall\n\nAfter the 1967 Arab\u2013Israeli war, Rabbi Yehuda Meir Getz was named the overseer of proceedings at the wall. After Rabbi Getz's death in 1995, Rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz was given the position.\n\n ## In Judaism\n\n ### History as place of prayer\n\n #### 11th\u201312th centuries\n\nThe Scroll of Ahimaaz, a historical document written in 1050 CE, distinctly describes the Western Wall as a place of prayer for the Jews. In around 1167 CE during the late Crusader Period, Benjamin of Tudela wrote that \"In front of this place is the western wall, which is one of the walls of the Holy of Holies. This is called the Gate of Mercy, and hither come all the Jews to pray before the Wall in the open court\".\n\n #### 17th century\n\nIn 1625 \"arranged prayers\" at the Wall are mentioned for the first time by a scholar whose name has not been preserved.\n\nIn 1994, Shlomo Goren wrote that the tradition of the wall as a Jewish prayer site was only 300 years old, the Jews being compelled to pray there after being forbidden to assemble on the mount itself.\n\n #### 18th\u201319th centuries\n\nScrolls of the Law were brought to the Wall on occasions of public distress and calamity, as testified to in a narrative written by Rabbi Gedaliah of Semitizi who went to Jerusalem in 1699.\n\n`The writings of various travellers in the Holy Land, especially in the 18th and 19th centuries, tell of how the Wall and its environs continued to be a place of devotion for the Jews. Isaac Yahuda, a prominent member of the Sephardic community in Jerusalem recalled how men and women used to gather in a circle at the Wall to hear sermons delivered in Ladino. His great-grandmother, who arrived in Palestine in 1841, \"used to go to the Western Wall every Friday afternoon, winter and summer, and stay there until candle-lighting time, reading the entire Book of Psalms and the Song of Songs...she would sit there by herself for hours.\"`\n\n #### 20th\u201321st centuries\n\nIn the past women could be found sitting at the entrance to the Wall every Sabbath holding fragrant herbs and spices in order to enable worshipers to make additional blessings. In the hot weather they would provide cool water. The women also used to cast lots for the privilege of sweeping and washing the alleyway at the foot of the Wall.\n\nThroughout several centuries, the Wall is where Jews have gathered to express gratitude to God or to pray for divine mercy. On news of the Normandy landings on June 6, 1944 thousands of Jews went to the Wall to offer prayers for the \"success of His Majesty's and Allied Forces in the liberation of all enemy-occupied territory.\" On October 13, 1994, 50,000 gathered to pray for the safe return of kidnapped soldier Nachshon Wachsman. August 10, 2005 saw a massive prayer rally at the Wall. Estimates of people protesting Israel's unilateral disengagement plan ranged from 50,000 to 250,000 people. Every year on Tisha B'Av large crowds congregate at the Wall to commemorate the destruction of the Temple. In 2007 over 100,000 gathered. During the month of Tishrei 2009, a record 1.5 million people visited the site.\n\n ### Relation to the Foundation Stone\n\nIn Judaism, the Western Wall is venerated as the sole remnant of the Holy Temple. It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews, as it is the closest permitted accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism, namely the Even ha-shetiya or Foundation Stone, which lies on the Temple Mount. According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by Kareth. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the Dome of the Rock is the Foundation Stone, some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain. This spot was the site of the Holy of Holies when the Temple stood.\n\n ### Part of the Temple proper\n\nRabbinic tradition teaches that the western wall was built upon foundations laid by the biblical King Solomon from the time of the First Temple.\n\nSome medieval rabbis claimed that today's Western Wall is a surviving wall of the Temple itself and cautioned Jews from approaching it, lest they enter the Temple precincts in a state of impurity. Many contemporary rabbis believe that the rabbinic traditions were made in reference to the Temple Mount's Western Wall, which accordingly endows the Wall with inherent holiness.\n\n ### Divine custody\n\nA 7th-century Midrash refers to a western wall of the Temple which \"would never be destroyed\", and a 6th-century Midrash mentions how Rome was unable to topple the western wall due to the Divine oath promising its eternal survival.\n\n ### Divine Presence\n\nAn 11th-century Midrash quotes a 4th-century scholar: \"Rav Acha said that the Divine Presence has never departed from the Western Wall\", and the Zohar (13th century) similarly writes that \"the Divine Presence rests upon the Western Wall\".\n\nEighteenth-century scholar Jonathan Eybeschutz writes that \"after the destruction of the Temple, God removed His Presence from His sanctuary and placed it upon the Western Wall where it remains in its holiness and honour\". It is told that great Jewish sages, including Isaac Luria and the Radvaz, experienced a revelation of the Divine Presence at the wall.\n\n ### Kabbalah of the word kotel\n\nRabbi Zvi Hirsch Kaindenover discusses the mystical aspect of the Hebrew word kotel when discussing the significance of praying against a wall. He cites the Zohar which writes that the word kotel, meaning wall, is made up of two parts: \"Ko\", which has the numerical value of God's name, and \"Tel\", meaning mount, which refers to the Temple and its Western Wall.\n\n ### Ritual\n\n #### Status as a synagogue\n\nMany contemporary Orthodox scholars rule that the area in front of the Wall has the status of a synagogue and must be treated with due respect. This is the view upheld by the authority in charge of the wall. As such, men and married women are expected to cover their heads upon approaching the Wall, and to dress appropriately. When departing, the custom is to walk backwards away from the Wall to show its sanctity. On Saturdays, it is forbidden to enter the area with electronic devices, including cameras, which infringe on the sanctity of the Sabbath.\n\n #### Contact with the Wall\n\nSome Orthodox Jewish codifiers warn against inserting fingers into the cracks of the Wall as they believe that the breadth of the Wall constitutes part of the Temple Mount itself and retains holiness, while others who permit doing so claim that the Wall is located outside the Temple area.\n\nIn the past, some visitors would write their names on the Wall, or based upon various scriptural verses, would drive nails into the crevices. These practices stopped after rabbis determined that such actions compromised the sanctity of the Wall. Another practice also existed whereby pilgrims or those intending to travel abroad would hack off a chip from the Wall or take some of the sand from between its cracks as a good luck charm or memento. In the late 19th century the question was raised as to whether this was permitted and a long responsa appeared in the Jerusalem newspaper Havatzelet in 1898. It concluded that even if according to Jewish Law it was permitted, the practices should be stopped as it constituted a desecration. More recently the Yalkut Yosef rules that it is forbidden to remove small chips of stone or dust from the Wall, although it is permissible to take twigs from the vegetation which grows in the Wall for an amulet, as they contain no holiness. Cleaning the stones is also problematic from a halachic point of view. Blasphemous graffiti once sprayed by a tourist was left visible for months until it began to peel away.\n\n #### Barefoot approach\n\nThere was once an old custom of removing one's shoes upon approaching the Wall. A 17th-century collection of special prayers to be said at holy places mentions that \"upon coming to the Western Wall one should remove his shoes, bow and recite...\". Rabbi Moses Reicher wrote that \"it is a good and praiseworthy custom to approach the Western Wall in white garments after ablution, kneel and prostrate oneself in submission and recite \"This is nothing other than the House of God and here is the gate of Heaven.\" When within four cubits of the Wall, one should remove their footwear.\" Over the years the custom of standing barefoot at the Wall has ceased, as there is no need to remove one's shoes when standing by the Wall, because the plaza area is outside the sanctified precinct of the Temple Mount.\n\n #### Mourning over the Temple's destruction\n\nAccording to Jewish Law, one is obliged to grieve and rend one's garment upon visiting the Western Wall and seeing the desolate site of the Temple. Bach (17th century) instructs that \"when one sees the Gates of Mercy which are situated in the Western Wall, which is the wall King David built, he should recite: Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the nations: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the Lord\". Some scholars write that rending one's garments is not applicable nowadays as Jerusalem is under Jewish control. Others disagree, pointing to the fact that the Temple Mount is controlled by the Muslim waqf and that the mosques which sit upon the Temple site should increase feelings of distress. If one hasn't seen the Wall for over 30 days, the prevailing custom is to rend one's garments, but this can be avoided if one visits on the Sabbath or on festivals. According to Donneal Epstein, a person who has not seen the Wall within the last 30 days should recite: \"Our Holy Temple, which was our glory, in which our forefathers praised You, was burned and all of our delights were destroyed\".\n\n #### Significance as place of prayer\n\nThe Sages of the Talmud stated that anyone who prays at the Temple in Jerusalem, \"it is as if he has prayed before the throne of glory because the gate of heaven is situated there and it is open to hear prayer.\" Jewish Law stipulates that the Silent Prayer should be recited facing towards Jerusalem, the Temple and ultimately the Holy of Holies, as God's bounty and blessing emanates from that spot. It is generally believed that prayer by the Western Wall is particularly beneficial since it was that wall which was situated closest to the Holy of Holies. Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger (1798\u20131871) writes, making reference to a medieval rabbi, \"since the Theology and ritual Israel's prayers ascend on high there... as one of the great ancient kabbalists Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla said, when the Jews send their prayers from the Diaspora in the direction of Jerusalem, from there they ascend by way of the Western Wall.\" A well-known segula (efficacious remedy) for finding one's soulmate is to pray for 40 consecutive days at the Western Wall, a practice apparently conceived by Rabbi Yisroel Yaakov Fisher (1928\u20132003).\n\n","h_score":2117728.1125000003,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":75225,"revid":1172511314,"description":"Holy site of Judaism in Jerusalem","categories":["Articles containing video clips","Buildings and structures completed in the 1st century BC","Establishments in the Herodian kingdom","Historic sites in Jerusalem","Jews and Judaism in the Roman Empire","Shrines in Jerusalem","Status quo holy places","Synagogues in Jerusalem","Temple Mount","Walls","Western Wall"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Western Wall: Jerusalem\u2019s Sacred Stone of Faith and Fire\"**\n\n*For millennia, this weathered limestone barrier has been a battleground of prayer, protest, and politics\u2014where faith meets the front lines of history.*\n\n---\n\n### **A Holy Wall, a Divided City**\nThe Western Wall, or *Kotel*, is the last remnant of the ancient Jewish Temple, destroyed in 70 CE. For Jews, it\u2019s the holiest prayer site on Earth; for Muslims, the nearby Al-Aqsa Compound is Islam\u2019s third-holiest. The wall\u2019s sacred power lies in its cracks\u2014where millions slip notes, kiss its stones, or weep for lost homes. \"This isn\u2019t just rock,\" says Rabbi **Noam Zion**, founder of the Israel-Palestine Center for Research and Information. \"It\u2019s a living dialogue between heaven and Earth.\"\n\n---\n\n### **From Prayer to Protest**\nThe wall\u2019s modern story is one of tension. After Israel captured East Jerusalem in 1967, it became a unifying symbol\u2014but also a flashpoint. Palestinian protesters often clash with police here, while ultra-Orthodox Jews pray behind gender-segregated barriers, sparking global debates. Nearby, a controversial \"Women of the Wall\" movement fights for equal worship rights. \"The Kotel reflects Jerusalem\u2019s soul,\" says Palestinian historian **Dr. Nadim Nassar**, \"and like the city, it\u2019s both a miracle and a wound.\"\n\n---\n### **Why It Still Matters Today**\nThe wall\u2019s fate is tied to Jerusalem\u2019s status\u2014a city claimed by both Israelis and Palestinians. Recent years have seen expanded prayer areas and heightened security, but no resolution to its deeper divisions. As tensions rise, the Kotel remains more than stone: it\u2019s a mirror for the region\u2019s unhealed past\u2014and its uncertain future."}

In turn the clitellates were divided into oligochaetes, which include earthworms, and hirudinomorphs, whose best-known members are leeches. For many years there was no clear arrangement of the approximately 80 polychaete families into higher-level groups. In 1997 Greg Rouse and Kristian Fauchald attempted a \"first heuristic step in terms of bringing polychaete systematics to an acceptable level of rigour\", based on anatomical structures, and divided polychaetes into: - Scolecida, less than 1,000 burrowing species that look rather like earthworms. - Palpata, the great majority of polychaetes, divided into: - Canalipalpata, which are distinguished by having long grooved palps that they use for feeding, and most of which live in tubes. - Aciculata, the most active polychaetes, which have parapodia reinforced by internal spines (aciculae). Also in 1997 Damhnait McHugh, using molecular phylogenetics to compare similarities and differences in one gene, presented a very different view, in which: the clitellates were an offshoot of one branch of the polychaete family tree; the pogonophorans and echiurans, which for a few decades had been regarded as a separate phyla, were placed on other branches of the polychaete tree. Subsequent molecular phylogenetics analyses on a similar scale presented similar conclusions. In 2007 Torsten Struck and colleagues compared three genes in 81 taxa, of which nine were outgroups, in other words not considered closely related to annelids but included to give an indication of where the organisms under study are placed on the larger tree of life. For a cross-check the study used an analysis of 11 genes (including the original 3) in ten taxa. This analysis agreed that clitellates, pogonophorans and echiurans were on various branches of the polychaete family tree. It also concluded that the classification of polychaetes into Scolecida, Canalipalpata and Aciculata was useless, as the members of these alleged groups were scattered all over the family tree derived from comparing the 81 taxa. It also placed sipunculans, generally regarded at the time as a separate phylum, on another branch of the polychaete tree, and concluded that leeches were a sub-group of oligochaetes rather than their sister-group among the clitellates. Rouse accepted the analyses based on molecular phylogenetics, and their main conclusions are now the scientific consensus, although the details of the annelid family tree remain uncertain. In addition to re-writing the classification of annelids and three previously independent phyla, the molecular phylogenetics analyses undermine the emphasis that decades of previous writings placed on the importance of segmentation in the classification of invertebrates. Polychaetes, which these analyses found to be the parent group, have completely segmented bodies, while polychaetes' echiurans and sipunculan offshoots are not segmented and pogonophores are segmented only in the rear parts of their bodies. It now seems that segmentation can appear and disappear much more easily in the course of evolution than was previously thought. The 2007 study also noted that the ladder-like nervous system, which is associated with segmentation, is less universal than previously thought in both annelids and arthropods. The updated phylogenetic tree of the Annelid phylum is comprised by a grade of basal groups of polychaetes: Palaeoannelida, Chaetopteriformia and the Amphinomida\/Sipuncula\/Lobatocerebrum clade. This grade is followed by Pleistoannelida, the clade containing nearly all of annelid diversity, divided into two highly diverse groups: Sedentaria and Errantia. Sedentaria contains the clitellates, pogonophorans, echiurans and some archiannelids, as well as several polychaete groups. Errantia contains the eunicid and phyllodocid polychaetes, and several archiannelids. Some small groups, such as the Myzostomida, are more difficult to place due to long branching, but belong to either one of these large groups.","h_score":2018219.6875,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":43116674,"revid":1171034605,"description":"Phylum of segmented worms","categories":["Annelids","Articles containing video clips","Cambrian first appearances","Extant Cambrian first appearances"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Worms: The Unsung Architects of Earth\u2019s Underground Empire\"**\n\n*Meet the annelids\u2014segmented, slithering superheroes who\u2019ve been tunneling through soil, oxygenating oceans, and recycling dead things since before dinosaurs.

They believed that all things were made of numbers. The number one (the monad) represented the origin of all things and the number two (the dyad) represented matter. The number three was an \"ideal number\" because it had a beginning, middle, and end and was the smallest number of points that could be used to define a plane triangle, which they revered as a symbol of the god Apollo. The number four signified the four seasons and the four elements. The number seven was also sacred because it was the number of planets and the number of strings on a lyre, and because Apollo's birthday was celebrated on the seventh day of each month. They believed that odd numbers were masculine, that even numbers were feminine, and that the number five represented marriage, because it was the sum of two and three.\n\nTen was regarded as the \"perfect number\" and the Pythagoreans honored it by never gathering in groups larger than ten. Pythagoras was credited with devising the tetractys, the triangular figure of four rows which add up to the perfect number, ten. The Pythagoreans regarded the tetractys as a symbol of utmost mystical importance. Iamblichus, in his Life of Pythagoras, states that the tetractys was \"so admirable, and so divinised by those who understood [it],\" that Pythagoras's students would swear oaths by it. Andrew Gregory concludes that the tradition linking Pythagoras to the tetractys is probably genuine.\n\nModern scholars debate whether these numerological teachings were developed by Pythagoras himself or by the later Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus of Croton. In his landmark study Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism, Walter Burkert argues that Pythagoras was a charismatic political and religious teacher, but that the number philosophy attributed to him was really an innovation by Philolaus. According to Burkert, Pythagoras never dealt with numbers at all, let alone made any noteworthy contribution to mathematics. Burkert argues that the only mathematics the Pythagoreans ever actually engaged in was simple, proofless arithmetic, but that these arithmetic discoveries did contribute significantly to the beginnings of mathematics.\n\n ## Pythagoreanism\n\n","h_score":2174776.7625000002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":23275,"revid":1172067359,"description":"Greek philosopher (c. 570 \u2013 c. 495 BC)","categories":["490s BC deaths","570s BC births","5th-century BC Greek philosophers","5th-century BC mathematicians","5th-century BC religious leaders","6th-century BC Greek philosophers","6th-century BC mathematicians","6th-century BC religious leaders","Ancient Greek geometers","Ancient Greek metaphysicians","Ancient Greek music theorists","Ancient Greek philosophers of mind","Ancient Greek political refugees","Ancient Greek shamans","Ancient Samians","Esotericists","Founders of religions","Numerologists","Pythagoras","Pythagoreans of Magna Graecia"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"The Man Who Turned Numbers Into a Religion (And Why We Still Worship Them)\"**\n\n*From ancient cults to modern algorithms, Pythagoras\u2019 obsession with order reshaped math, music\u2014and the human soul.

In early 1686, he composed one of his best-remembered haiku: > > `  an ancient pond \/ a frog jumps in \/ the splash of water [1686]` Historians believe this poem became instantly famous: in April, the poets of Edo gathered at the bash\u014d hut for a haikai no renga contest on the subject of frogs that seems to have been a tribute to Bash\u014d's hokku, which was placed at the top of the compilation. Bash\u014d stayed in Edo, continuing to teach and hold contests, with an excursion in the autumn of 1687 when he traveled to the countryside for moon watching, and a longer trip in 1688 when he returned to Ueno to celebrate the Lunar New Year. At home in Edo, Bash\u014d sometimes became reclusive: he alternated between rejecting visitors to his hut and appreciating their company. At the same time, he enjoyed his life and had a subtle sense of humor, as reflected in his hokku: > > `  now then, let's go out \/ to enjoy the snow ... until \/ I slip and fall! [1688]` ### Oku no Hosomichi\n\nBash\u014d's private planning for another long journey, to be described in his masterwork Oku no Hosomichi, or The Narrow Road to the Deep North, culminated on May 16, 1689 (Yayoi 27, Genroku 2), when he left Edo with his student and apprentice Kawai Sora (\u6cb3\u5408 \u66fe\u826f) on a journey to the Northern Provinces of Honsh\u016b. Bash\u014d and Sora headed north to Hiraizumi, which they reached on June 29. They then walked to the western side of the island, touring Kisakata on July 30, and began hiking back at a leisurely pace along the coastline. During this 150-day journey Bash\u014d traveled a total of 600 ri (2,400 km) through the northeastern areas of Honsh\u016b, returning to Edo in late 1691.\n\nBy the time Bash\u014d reached \u014cgaki, Gifu Prefecture, he had completed the log of his journey. He edited and redacted it for three years, writing the final version in 1694 as The Narrow Road to the Interior (\u5965\u306e\u7d30\u9053, Oku no Hosomichi). The first edition was published posthumously in 1702. It was an immediate commercial success and many other itinerant poets followed the path of his journey. It is often considered his finest achievement, featuring hokku such as:\n\n> > `  the rough sea \/ stretching out towards Sado \/ the Milky Way [1689]`\n\n ### Last years\n\nOn his return to Edo in the winter of 1691, Bash\u014d lived in his third bash\u014d hut, again provided by his disciples. This time, he was not alone; he took in his nephew Toin and a female friend Jutei, who were both recovering from illness. He had many great visitors.\n\nBash\u014d wrote to a friend that \"disturbed by others, I have no peace of mind\". Until late August 1693, he continued to make a living from teaching and appearances at haikai parties. Then he shut the gate to his bash\u014d hut and refused to see anybody for a month. Finally, he relented after adopting the principle of karumi or \"lightness\", a semi-Buddhist philosophy of greeting the mundane world rather than separating from it.\n\nBash\u014d left Edo for the last time in the summer of 1694, spending time in Ueno and Kyoto before arriving in Osaka. There, he came down with a stomach illness and surrounded by his disciples, died peacefully. Although he did not compose a formal death poem, the following is generally accepted as his poem of farewell:\n\n> > `  `\n> > `      falling sick on a journey \/ my dream goes wandering \/ on a withered field [1694] `\n\n ## Influence and literary criticism\n\n","h_score":1991910.84375,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":90625,"revid":1173102967,"description":"Japanese poet","categories":["1644 births","1694 deaths","17th-century Japanese LGBT people","17th-century Japanese poets","Articles containing Japanese poems","Buddhist poets","Gay poets","Japanese Buddhists","Japanese LGBT poets","Japanese Zen Buddhists","Japanese gay writers","Japanese haiku poets","Japanese writers of the Edo period","LGBT Buddhists","People from Mie Prefecture","Writers from Mie Prefecture"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nA single *haiku* can hold a universe. Matsuo Bash\u014d (1644\u20131694) didn\u2019t just write poetry\u2014he turned fleeting moments into eternity. A frog leaps, a moon glows, a road bends\u2026 and suddenly, the world feels *alive*. Who was this man who saw magic in the mundane? Let\u2019s step into his sandals.\n\n---\n\n**2\/10**\nBash\u014d wasn\u2019t born a poet. He started as a samurai\u2019s son, then a wandering *ronin* before finding his voice in verse. His early haiku? Playful, even cheeky. But after a life-changing pilgrimage, his words grew deeper, like a river carving stone. The journey *changed* him\u2014and his art.\n\n---\n\n**3\/10**\nImagine this: a man in a tattered cloak, staff in hand, trudging through rain-soaked roads. That was Bash\u014d. His 1689 journey to the north (the *Oku no Hosomichi*) wasn\u2019t just a trip\u2014it was a spiritual odyssey. Every inn, every bridge, every bowl of tea became a brushstroke in his masterpiece.\n\n---\n\n**4\/10**\nBash\u014d\u2019s genius? He made *nothing* sacred. A *cold slice of melon*\u2014suddenly, summer\u2019s ghost lingers. A *falling leaf*? Autumn\u2019s whisper. His haiku don\u2019t describe; they *evoke*. Try this: read one aloud. Feel the silence between the words. That\u2019s where the magic hides.\n\n---\n**5\/10**\nHis most famous poem? *\"An old silent pond\u2026 \/ a frog jumps in\u2014 \/ sound of water.\"* Five syllables, five more, seven. Boom. The universe *rips open*. But here\u2019s the secret: Bash\u014d didn\u2019t just *observe* the frog. He *became* the splash. That\u2019s the haiku spirit.\n\n---\n**6\/10**\nBash\u014d\u2019s life was short (he died at 50), but his influence? Eternal. He turned haiku from party games into *art*. His disciples? A who\u2019s-who of Japanese poetry. Even today, his rules\u2014*kigo* (seasonal words), *kireji* (cutting words)\u2014shape how we see the world.\n\n---\n**7\/10**\nFun fact: Bash\u014d *hated* pretension. Once, a student wrote a haiku about \"the moon\u2019s cold beauty.\" Bash\u014d\u2019s reply? *\"Where were YOU when you wrote it?\"* Poetry, he said, should smell like *dirt and sweat*\u2014not ink and ego.\n\n---\n**8\/10**\nHis later years? Haunted. A plague, a failed love, a dying friend. His poems grew stark, like winter branches. Yet even then, he found beauty in decay. *\"On a bare branch \/ a crow has settled\u2014 \/ autumn evening.\"* Grief and grace, tangled together.\n\n---\n**9\/10**\nBash\u014d\u2019s legacy? He taught us to *see*. Not just look at a cherry blossom, but *feel* its fleeting life. Not just hear rain, but *drown* in it. In a world of noise, his haiku are a quiet rebellion. Try this: pause. Breathe. Now write *one* line about what you see.\n\n---\n**10\/10**\nSo here\u2019s the payoff: Bash\u014d\u2019s greatest haiku wasn\u2019t written in ink. It was his *life*\u2014a wandering, weathered, wide-open poem. Next time you see a leaf fall or hear a train rumble, ask: *What would Bash\u014d write?* Then steal his thunder. The world needs your frogs, your moons, your *splashes*. #Haiku #WanderLikeBash\u014d"}

The Temenggong intended to create a new administration centre for the Johor Sultanate to create a dynasty under the entity of Temenggong. As the Temenggong already had a close relationship with the British and the British intended to have control over trade activities in Singapore, a treaty was signed between Sultan Ali and Temenggong Ibrahim in Singapore on 10 March 1855. According to the treaty, Ali would be crowned as the Sultan of Johor and receive \\$5,000 (in Spanish dollars) with an allowance of \\$500 per month. In return, Ali was required to cede the sovereignty of the territory of Johor (except Kesang of Muar which would be the only territory under his control) to Temenggong Ibrahim. When both sides agreed on Temenggong acquiring the territory, he renamed it Iskandar Puteri and began to administer it from Telok Blangah in Singapore.\n\nAs the area was still an undeveloped jungle, Temenggong encouraged the migration of Chinese and Javanese to clear the land and to develop an agricultural economy in Johor. The Chinese planted the area with black pepper and gambier, while the Javanese dug parit (canals) to drain water from the land, build roads and plant coconuts. During this time, a Chinese businessman, pepper and gambier cultivator, Wong Ah Fook arrived; at the same time, the Kangchu and Javanese labour contract systems were introduced by the Chinese and Javanese communities. After Temenggong's death on 31 January 1862, the town was renamed \"Johor Bahru\" and his position was succeeded by his son, Abu Bakar, with the administration centre in Telok Blangah being moved to the area in 1889.\n\n ### British administration\n\nIn the first phase of Abu Bakar's administration, the British only recognised him as a maharaja rather than a sultan. In 1855, the British Colonial Office began to recognise his status as a Sultan after he met Queen Victoria. He managed to regain Kesang territory for Johor after a civil war with the aid of British forces and he boosted the town's infrastructure and agricultural economy. Infrastructure such as the State Mosque and Royal Palace was built with the aid of Wong Ah Fook, who had become a close patron for the Sultan since his migration during the Temenggong reign. As the Johor-British relationship improved, Abu Bakar also set up his administration under a British style and implemented a constitution known as Undang-undang Tubuh Negeri Johor (Johor State Constitution). Although the British had long been advisers for the Sultanate of Johor, the Sultanate never came under direct colonial rule of the British. The direct colonial rule only came into effect when the status of the adviser was elevated to a status similar to that of a Resident in the Federated Malay States (FMS) during the reign of Sultan Ibrahim in 1914.\n\nIn Johor Bahru, the Malay Peninsula railway extension was finished in 1909, and in 1923 the Johor\u2013Singapore Causeway was completed. Johor Bahru developed at a modest rate between the First and Second World Wars. The secretariat building\u2014Sultan Ibrahim Building\u2014was completed in 1940 as the British colonial government attempted to streamline the state's administration.\n\n","h_score":2069992.6937500001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":368790,"revid":1173727448,"description":null,"categories":["1855 establishments in Asia","Johor Bahru","Malaysia\u2013Singapore border crossings","Populated coastal places in Malaysia","Populated places established in 1855","Populated places in Johor"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nJohor Bahru isn\u2019t just Malaysia\u2019s southern gateway\u2014it\u2019s a *vibrant* crossroads where history, hustle, and flavor collide.

His encounter with Ming China in 1517\u2014after initial contacts by Jorge \u00c1lvares and Rafael Perestrello in 1513 and 1516, respectively\u2014marked the resumption of direct European commercial and diplomatic contact with China. (Even though there were Europeans in Medieval China, notably Marco Polo, that period of contact had been interrupted by the fall of the Yuan dynasty.)\n\nAlthough de Andrade's mission was initially a success that allowed a Portuguese embassy to proceed all the way to Beijing, relations were soon spoiled by culminating events that led to an extremely negative impression of the Portuguese in China. This included acts of his brother Sim\u00e3o that enraged the Chinese, false reports of the Portuguese being cannibals of kidnapped Chinese children and true reports of their conquest of Malacca, a loyal Ming tributary state. Normalized trade and relations between Portugal and the Ming dynasty would not resume until the late 1540s and the 1557 establishment of Portuguese rule over Macau.\n\nAndrade was referred to as a \"Folangji\" (\u4f5b\u90ce\u6a5f) in Ming dynastic archives. Folangji comes from Franques or Franks, which was a generic name the Muslims called Europeans since the Crusades, and which spawned the Indian-Southeast Asian term ferengi.

While recognizing its importance, Adams had privately criticized Thomas Paine's 1776 pamphlet Common Sense, which attacked all forms of monarchy, even constitutional monarchy of the sort advocated by John Locke. It supported a unicameral legislature and a weak executive elected by the legislature. According to Adams, the author had \"a better hand at pulling down than building.\" He believed that the views expressed in the pamphlet were \"so democratical, without any restraint or even an attempt at any equilibrium or counter poise, that it must produce confusion and every evil work.\" What Paine advocated was a radical democracy, incompatible with the system of checks and balances that conservatives like Adams would implement. At the urging of some delegates, Adams committed his views to paper in separate letters. So impressed was Richard Henry Lee that, with Adams's consent, he had the most comprehensive letter printed. Published anonymously in April 1776, it was titled Thoughts on Government and styled as \"a Letter from a Gentleman to his Friend.\" Many historians agree that none of Adams's other compositions rivaled the enduring influence of this pamphlet.\n\nAdams advised that the form of government should be chosen to attain the desired ends \u2013 the happiness and virtue of the greatest number of people. He wrote, \"There is no good government but what is republican. That the only valuable part of the British constitution is so because the very definition of a republic is an empire of laws, and not of men.\" The treatise defended bicameralism, for \"a single assembly is liable to all the vices, follies and frailties of an individual.\" Adams suggested that there should be a separation of powers between the executive, the judicial and the legislative branches, and further recommended that if a continental government were to be formed then it \"should sacredly be confined\" to certain enumerated powers. Thoughts on Government was referenced in every state-constitution writing hall. Adams used the letter to attack opponents of independence. He claimed that John Dickinson's fear of republicanism was responsible for his refusal to support independence, and that opposition from Southern planters was rooted in fear that their aristocratic slaveholding status would be endangered.\n\n ### Massachusetts Constitution\n\nAfter returning from his first mission to France in 1779, Adams was elected to the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention with the purpose of establishing a new constitution for Massachusetts. He served on a committee of three, also including Samuel Adams and James Bowdoin, to draft the constitution. The writing fell primarily to John Adams. The resulting Constitution of Massachusetts was approved in 1780. It was the first constitution written by a special committee, then ratified by the people, and was the first to feature a bicameral legislature. Included were a distinct executive \u2013 though restrained by an executive council \u2013 with a qualified (two-thirds) veto, and an independent judicial branch. The judges were given lifetime appointments, to \"hold their offices during good behavior.\"\n\nThe Constitution affirmed the \"duty\" of the individual to worship the \"Supreme Being,\" and the right to do so without molestation \"in the manner most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience.\" It established free public education for three years to the children of all citizens.

Following the end of its operations at Glanville Hall, Port Adelaide was forced to find a new ground to operate from. It was decided that the club would use Alberton Oval for the 1880 season. On 15 May 1880, Port Adelaide played its first match at Alberton Oval. The following year, the decision was made by the club to start leasing the oval from the Port Adelaide Council for the sum of 10 shillings a year. The oval is also used for training purposes for both AFL and SANFL operations, aside from 1997 through 2001 when SANFL training temporarily moved to Ethelton.\n\nIn 1975 and 1976, Port Adelaide was temporarily locked out of the ground following a dispute between the Port Adelaide Council, the SANFL and the Club over seating arrangements at the ground. The club usually split its seating revenue 50\/50 with the SANFL during this time period, an arrangement the SANFL held with each club. However, the Port Adelaide Council wanted to take 50% of all game day revenue, leaving the remaining half to the two to split between themselves. In 1975, the SANFL refused to accept the offer for the ground provided by the council, resulting in the temporary suspension of Port Adelaide's lease on the ground. This prevented Port Adelaide from playing any games at the venue and, the following year, training at the venue. With the 1977 season pending, the issues between the council and the club were resolved and the club was permitted to return that year.\n\nThe ground possesses two notable grandstands named after individuals important to the club. The Fos Williams Family Stand is the oldest remaining structure at Alberton Oval, first constructed in 1903. The other grandstand, the Robert B. Quinn MM Grandstand, was first opened in 1972. The ground also has the bordering Allan Scott Power Headquarters for the administration of Port Adelaide, which opened in 1999 and is named after the club's initial major sponsor.\n\n #### Football Park (1997\u20132013)\n\nPort Adelaide first played at Football Park on 15 June 1974. Despite not being officially recognised as a 'home ground' in the SANFL, it hosted night matches for every team, as well as all finals between 1974 and 2014 regardless of 'home' team. During 1975 and 1976, Port Adelaide sold some of their home games (to be played at their temporary home, Adelaide Oval) to Football Park.\n\nUpon the club's entry to the AFL, fellow South Australian club was already using the ground for their home matches. Port Adelaide was assigned the ground as its home venue, alongside its existing tenants. Port Adelaide's first official AFL match at the ground was on 6 April 1997, where they were defeated by Essendon by 33 points.\n\nPlanned upgrades to the stadium were cancelled following news that Port Adelaide, alongside both Adelaide and the SANFL, would make use of Adelaide Oval from 2014 onward, as it had been recently redeveloped. It hosted its final AFL match on the 31st of August that year, where Port Adelaide was defeated by a point by Carlton. The ground remains the headquarters of Adelaide, though features such as the ground's grandstands have been demolished.\n\n #### Adelaide Oval (2014\u2013present)\n\nSince 2014, Adelaide Oval has been the home ground of Port Adelaide's AFL team, shared with .\n\nAdelaide Oval has historically been used for SANFL Finals (until 1974) and the Championship of Australia match. During the 1975 and 1976 seasons, Port Adelaide's SANFL Team was forced to play out of the ground following their dispute with the local council, using it for both match day playing and training purposes over the period. Its role as the primary venue for SANFL finals was supplanted by Football Park in 1974, following disagreements between the SANFL and South Australian Cricket Association (SACA).\n\nFollowing extensive redevelopment in the early 2010s and negotiations between the SANFL and SACA over the use of the ground, the ground was cleared for football usage purposes, allowing Port Adelaide to use the ground as its home ground from the 2014 season onwards. Port Adelaide also played the first official AFL match at the venue in 2011 against Melbourne.\n\nAdelaide Oval has two notable stands named after significant Port Adelaide individuals, the Fos Williams Stand, and the Gavin Wanganeen Stand. Both were named after the redevelopment of the Eastern Stand at the ground, and are featured alongside other famous individuals from the SANFL and .\n\n ### Club creed\n\nFos Williams authored the club's creed in 1962.\n\n ## Rivalries\n\n ### AFL\n\n #### Adelaide\n\nPort Adelaide has a fierce rivalry with fellow South Australian AFL team Adelaide. Matches between the two teams are known as the 'Showdown'. The rivalry between Adelaide and Port Adelaide is often considered to be among the best rivalries in the Australian Football League, with Malcolm Blight, Australian Football Hall of Fame Legend, stating in 2009 that \"there is no doubt it is the greatest rivalry in football\". The Showdown rivalry also significantly draws upon the bitter, winner take all, competition for the two South Australian licences to join the AFL in the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\n #### Brisbane Lions\n\nThis rivalry dates back to 1997, the inaugural season of Port Adelaide and the newly merged Brisbane Lions. In their early days, the two clubs had multiple close encounters, with a draw in two of their first three meetings. In the early 2000s, the rivalry reached its peak as the two clubs would be the most dominant of the era, meeting in multiple finals and consistently finishing at the top of the ladder from 2001 to 2004. Notable encounters include a Round 22 match in 2002 to determine the minor premiership that year, which Port Adelaide won by a single goal, and a Round 17 match in 2003 with 7 lead changes in the final quarter, which Port Adelaide won by a point. The rivalry culminated with the 2004 AFL Grand Final, where Port Adelaide defeated Brisbane to win their first premiership, and end Brisbane's chance to win a fourth consecutive. The rivalry has since died down.\n\n ### SANFL\n\n #### Norwood\n\nThe rivalry between Port Adelaide and the Norwood Football Club is one of the longest standing rivalries in South Australian league football. The two clubs met for the first time in 1878, where Port Adelaide hosted Norwood, with the visitors winning 1\u20130. However, the rivalry between the two clubs would first begin in 1882, where Port Adelaide's first win over Norwood was controversially overruled by the league, with a follow-up game overshadowed by a misunderstanding at the gate which almost prevented Norwood players accessing the venue.\n\nThe clubs met in 14 Grand Finals prior to Port Adelaide's accession into the AFL and share over 60 premierships between them. In 1884, Port Adelaide won the premiership, bringing Norwood's run of six premierships in a row to an end. In 1960, Norwood brought Port Adelaide's own record run of six premierships to an end defeating them by 27 points in the 1960 Preliminary Final. They have met in three Grand Finals following Port Adelaide's entry to the AFL, with Port Adelaide winning in 1999 and Norwood winning in 1997 and 2014. The two clubs are the only clubs in any of the elite Australian Rules Football leagues (the SANFL, WAFL, and VFL\/AFL) to win six successive premierships.\n\n ## Playing lists\n\n ## Corporate\n\n ### Administrative positions\n\n- Chairman: David Koch\n- Chief executive: Matthew Richardson\n- Football operations: Chris Davies\n- Board members:\n  - Kevin Osborn (deputy chairman)\n  - Cos Cardone\n  - Darren Cahill\n  - Holly Ransom\n  - Jamie Restas\n  - Andrew Day\n  - Kathy Nagle\n  - Christine Zeitz\n  - Rob Snowdon\n\n ### Sponsors\n\n`Current major sponsors `\n\n- GFG Alliance\n- KFC\n- MG Motor\n\n`Key China game sponsors `\n\n- Shanghai Cred\n\n`Apparel sponsors `\n\n- Nike (1997\u20132006)\n- Reebok (2007\u20132012)\n- ISC (2013\u20132020)\n- Macron (2021\u2013present)\n\n ## Supporters\n\nThe Port Adelaide Football Club has historically drawn its supporter base in the region of Port Adelaide. Since the club's entry to the AFL, support for the club had increased within suburbs of Adelaide \u2013 notably, the northern suburbs. It has also experienced growth in regional South Australia.\n\nPort Adelaide has many supporter groups from all around Australia, with every state and territory except Tasmania having an officially recognised supporter group. Among these, the Port Adelaide Cheer Squad, the official supporter group from Adelaide, creates banners to be used by the club and has official seating to cheer at home games. There are also a number of unofficial supporter groups who perform activities for the club and its fans, such as the Outer Army and the Alberton Crowd.\n\n ### Number-one ticket holders\n\n- David Koch \u2013 Seven Network's Sunrise co-host, current club chairman\n- Stuart O'Grady \u2013 Australian professional road bicycle racer\n- Teresa Palmer \u2013 Australian model and actress\n- Bob Quinn \u2013 former Port Adelaide player\n- Tony Santic \u2013 owner of racehorse Makybe Diva\n\n ### Membership and attendance\n\n ## Partnerships\n\n ### Indigenous community\n\nThe Port Adelaide Football Club has a long-standing connection to the indigenous community. Initial club president John Hart Jr., alongside his father, were the founders of The Adelaide Milling and Mercantile Company in Port Adelaide, which employed Kaurna people alongside non-indigenous workers as early as the 1850s. John Hart Sr. advocated for other settlers to refrain from killing and eating black swans as they were a totem of the Kaurna people. Harry Hewitt was named in Port Adelaide's side when they defeated Fitzroy by two goals on Adelaide Oval in 1891 and is the club's first known Indigenous Australian player. During the 1950s, St Francis House in Glanville housed young indigenous boys, many of whom played for Port Adelaide. Richie Bray became the club's first known Indigenous player to win a premiership, featuring in the 1962, 1963 and 1965 premierships winning teams.\n\nPort Adelaide has been represented by 62 indigenous players across the SANFL and AFL competitions throughout its history. Upon the club's entry to the AFL in 1997, the club appointed its first Indigenous captain in Gavin Wanganeen. Wanganeen would later become the first indigenous player in the AFL to play 300 games, and the first indigenous player to join the board of an AFL club.\n\nIn 2008, the club started the Aboriginal Power Cup to help promote academic and healthy outcomes for indigenous students in South Australia.\n\n ### China partnership\n\nOn 14 April 2016, Port Adelaide announced it had struck a three-year multimillion-dollar partnership with leading Chinese property developer Shanghai Cred, where Port Adelaide would take primary responsibility for developing Australian rules football in China. This involved the club holding annual training camps and providing sponsorship in China, as well as producing AFL programs and broadcasting games in the country via China Central Television and other networks. The same day, it was revealed by then Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that Port Adelaide had an intention to play an in-season AFL match in China. As part of the partnership, Port Adelaide also agreed to annually run an Australian rules football program in over 20 Chinese schools, culminating in a football carnival the same week the AFL premiership match is held in Shanghai.\n\nThe first AFL game played for premiership points was played in May 2017 between the Gold Coast Suns and Port Adelaide. In October 2018, the AFL announced St Kilda would be taking over from the Gold Coast Suns in the China fixture, with Gold Coast citing guernsey disagreements as a reason for exiting the deal. In 2019, 4.01 million people watched the match between Port Adelaide and St Kilda. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the match was not played in the 2020 or 2021 AFL seasons.\n\n ## Club honour boards\n\n ### Honour Board\n\nIn the Port Adelaide clubrooms at Alberton Oval there is a large wooden honour board with gold text that details every season of the club from 1870 to the present.\n\n #### SANFL Honour Board (Post AFL Entry)\n\n ### Hall of Fame\n\nPort Adelaide launched the club Hall of Fame on 20 February 1998, when it inducted inaugural 18 members into the Hall of Fame. It has since honoured 40 more players, coaches, administrators and club servants who have played a major part in the club, in addition to two eras of premiership teams.\n\n ### Greatest Team\n\nIn June 2001, the Port Adelaide Football Club announced its 'Greatest Team' from the prior two centuries, consisting of the most successful players from the club. Between the 22 players inducted, they shared 201 premiership medals, 532 state games, 16 Magarey Medals and numerous other football accolades. The club hailed the group the \"Greatest Team of the Greatest Club\".\n\n ### Military service\n\n ## Club achievements\n\nPort Adelaide is one of the most successful clubs in senior level football, having won a record 37 senior premierships across the AFL and SANFL competitions. The club won its first premiership in 1884, while its most recent senior level premiership was in 2004. The club has won a record 4 Championship of Australia titles, and have won the Stanley H. Lewis trophy 12 times, second to only Norwood (14). Port Adelaide has had two notable periods of success under the leadership of Fos Williams, who coached 9 premierships, and John Cahill, who coached 10.\n\n ## Player achievements\n\n ### Competition awards\n\nBrownlow Medal (AFL fairest and best)\n\n- 2021 \u2013 Ollie Wines\n\nMagarey Medal (SANFL best and fairest)\n\n- 1899 \u2013 Stan Malin\n- 1907 \u2013 Jack Mack\n- 1910 \u2013 Sampson Hosking\n- 1914 \u2013 Jack Ashley\n- 1915 \u2013 Sampson Hosking\n- 1921 \u2013 Charlie Adams\n- 1925 \u2013 Peter Bampton\n- 1938 \u2013 Bob Quinn\n- 1945 \u2013 Bob Quinn\n- 1956 \u2013 Dave Boyd\n- 1964 \u2013 Geof Motley\n- 1967 \u2013 Trevor Obst\n- 1971 \u2013 Russell Ebert\n- 1974 \u2013 Russell Ebert\n- 1975 \u2013 Peter Woite\n- 1976 \u2013 Russell Ebert\n- 1980 \u2013 Russell Ebert\n- 1986 \u2013 Greg Anderson\n- 1990 \u2013 Scott Hodges\n- 1992 \u2013 Nathan Buckley\n- 2001 \u2013 Tony Brown and Ryan O'Connor\n- 2003 \u2013 Brett Ebert\n- 2005 \u2013 Jeremy Clayton\n\nAFLCA Champion Player of the Year\n\n- 2004 \u2013 Warren Tredrea\n- 2014 \u2013 Robbie Gray\n- 2023 - Zak Butters\n\nAFL Rising Star (Best player under 21)\n\n- 1997 \u2013 Michael Wilson\n- 2006 \u2013 Danyle Pearce\n\n ### Grand final best on ground awards\n\nNorm Smith Medal (AFL Grand Final best on ground)\n\n- 2004 \u2013 Byron Pickett\n\nJack Oatey Medal (SANFL Grand Final best on ground)\n\n- 1981 \u2013 Russell Ebert\n- 1988 \u2013 Bruce Abernethy\n- 1989 \u2013 Russell Johnston\n- 1990 \u2013 George Fiacchi\n- 1992 \u2013 Nathan Buckley\n- 1994 \u2013 Darryl Wakelin\n- 1995 \u2013 Anthony Darcy\n- 1996 \u2013 David Brown\n- 1998 \u2013 Brett Chalmers\n- 1999 \u2013 Darryl Poole\n\n","h_score":1878695.2000000002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":24602,"revid":1173783579,"description":"Australian rules football club","categories":["1870 establishments in Australia","Australian Football League clubs","Australian rules football clubs established in 1870","Australian rules football clubs in South Australia","Port Adelaide Football Club","Sports clubs and teams in Adelaide"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Port Adelaide Football Club: A Powerhouse in the AFL\u2019s Modern Era**\n\n*After a 17-year drought, the Power have reclaimed their place as a premiership contender\u2014here\u2019s how they\u2019ve built a winning culture.*\n\n---\n\n**A Legacy of Highs and Lows**\nPort Adelaide\u2019s history is defined by dramatic swings.

German leaders knew that the policy would likely provoke U.S. entrance into the war, but they hoped to defeat the Allied Powers before the U.S. could fully mobilize. In late February, the U.S. public learned of the Zimmermann Telegram, a secret diplomatic communication in which Germany sought to convince Mexico to join it in a war against the United States. After a series of attacks on American ships, Wilson held a Cabinet meeting on March 20; all Cabinet members agreed that the time had come for the United States to enter the war. The Cabinet members believed that Germany was engaged in a commercial war against the United States, and that the United States had to respond with a formal declaration of war.\n\nOn April 2, 1917, Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war against Germany, arguing that Germany was engaged in \"nothing less than war against the government and people of the United States.\" He requested a military draft to raise the army, increased taxes to pay for military expenses, loans to Allied governments, and increased industrial and agricultural production. He stated, \"we have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion... no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and freedom of the nations can make them.\" The declaration of war by the United States against Germany passed Congress with strong bipartisan majorities on April 6, 1917. The United States later declared war against Austria-Hungary in December 1917.\n\nWith the U.S. entrance into the war, Wilson and Secretary of War Newton D. Baker launched an expansion of the army, with the goal of creating a 300,000-member Regular Army, a 440,000-member National Guard, and a 500,000-member conscripted force known as the \"National Army.\" Despite some resistance to conscription and to the commitment of American soldiers abroad, large majorities of both houses of Congress voted to impose conscription with the Selective Service Act of 1917. Seeking to avoid the draft riots of the Civil War, the bill established local draft boards that were charged with determining who should be drafted. By the end of the war, nearly 3 million men had been drafted. The navy also saw tremendous expansion, and Allied shipping losses dropped substantially due to U.S. contributions and a new emphasis on the convoy system.\n\n #### The Fourteen Points\n\nWilson sought the establishment of \"an organized common peace\" that would help prevent future conflicts. In this goal, he was opposed not just by the Central Powers, but also the other Allied Powers, who, to various degrees, sought to win concessions and to impose a punitive peace agreement on the Central Powers. On January 8, 1918, Wilson delivered a speech, known as the Fourteen Points, wherein he articulated his administration's long term war objectives. Wilson called for the establishment of an association of nations to guarantee the independence and territorial integrity of all nations\u2014a League of Nations. Other points included the evacuation of occupied territory, the establishment of an independent Poland, and self-determination for the peoples of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire.\n\n","h_score":2328305.8500000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":33523,"revid":1173401430,"description":"28th President of the United States","categories":["1856 births","1924 deaths","19th-century American people","19th-century Presbyterians","20th-century Presbyterians","20th-century presidents of the United States","American Nobel laureates","American Presbyterians","American lawyers admitted to the practice of law by reading law","American people of World War I","American segregationists","Articles containing video clips","Bourbon Democrats","Bryn Mawr College faculty","Burials at Washington National Cathedral","Candidates in the 1912 United States presidential election","Candidates in the 1916 United States presidential election","Democratic Party (United States) presidential nominees","Democratic Party governors of New Jersey","Democratic Party presidents of the United States","Dunning School","Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences","Georgia (U.S. state) lawyers","Governors of New Jersey","Hall of Fame for Great Americans inductees","Johns Hopkins University alumni","League of Nations people","Liberalism in the United States","Members of the American Philosophical Society","Neo-Confederates","Neurological disease deaths in Washington, D.C.","New Jersey Democrats","Nobel Peace Prize laureates","People from Kalorama (Washington, D.C.)","People from Princeton, New Jersey","People from Staunton, Virginia","People from Strabane","People of the Russian Civil War","Politicians from Augusta, Georgia","Politicians from Staunton, Virginia","Presbyterians from New Jersey","Presidency of Woodrow Wilson","Presidents of Princeton University","Presidents of the American Historical Association","Presidents of the United States","Princeton University alumni","Princeton University faculty","Progressive Era in the United States","Progressivism in the United States","Recipients of the Order of the White Eagle (Poland)","University of Virginia faculty","Wesleyan Cardinals football coaches","Wesleyan University faculty","Woodrow Wilson","Woodrow Wilson family"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Woodrow Wilson: The Scholar-President Who Reshaped a Nation\u2014and the World\"**\n\n*From segregationist to globalist, Wilson\u2019s legacy is a paradox: a man who expanded democracy at home while entrenching racial injustice, and who dreamed of a \"league of nations\" before the world was ready.*\n\n---\n\n### **The Academic Turned Leader**\nWoodrow Wilson wasn\u2019t born to politics\u2014he was forged in the quiet halls of Princeton, where his sharp mind and steely resolve earned him the presidency of the university at just 40.

From 1984\u201385 to 1990\u201391, the Flames tallied 90 points in every season but one. However, they were usually unable to transform that success into a deep playoff run, largely because they could not get the better of their provincial rivals, the powerhouse Edmonton Oilers. The Oilers and Flames usually finished at or near the top of the Campbell Conference and were usually among the best teams in the entire league during this time. However, the NHL's playoff structure of the time made it very likely the Flames would meet the Oilers in either the first or second round, rather than in the Campbell Conference finals. That same structure made it very likely that the other two playoff qualifiers in the Smythe Division would have to get past the Flames or Oilers (or both) in order to make it to the conference finals. From 1983 until 1990, either the Oilers or the Flames represented the Campbell Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals. By 1986, the Flames landed forwards Doug Risebrough, Lanny McDonald and Dan Quinn, defenceman Al MacInnis and goaltender Mike Vernon. Finishing second in the Smythe with a 40\u201331\u20139 record (the only season from 1984 to 1991 in which they did not finish with 90 or more points), the Flames swept the Winnipeg Jets in the first round of the playoffs, setting up a showdown with the Oilers. Edmonton finished 30 points ahead of Calgary during the season, and was heavily favoured to win a third Cup in a row. However, the Flames upset the Oilers in seven games, the only time the Flames defeated the Oilers in a playoff series in the decade. The series-winning goal came when an errant clearing attempt by Steve Smith ricocheted off goaltender Grant Fuhr's leg and into his own net. The goal remains one of the most legendary blunders in hockey history. From there, the Flames went on to the Campbell Conference Finals, where they defeated the St. Louis Blues in another seven-game series. This time, Calgary had to survive a scare of its own, shaking off the Monday Night Miracle at the St. Louis Arena. Trailing by a score of 5\u20132 with ten minutes to play in the third period of Game 6, the Blues mounted a furious comeback to send the contest into overtime, where Doug Wickenheiser scored to force a deciding seventh game. Calgary won Game 7 at home, 2\u20131, advancing into the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time. The Flames proved to be no match for the Montreal Canadiens, losing the championship series in five games. Montreal rookie goaltender Patrick Roy was nearly unbeatable in the last two games, allowing only four goals en route to winning the Conn Smythe Trophy. The Flames followed up their run to the Finals with their best regular season to that point. Calgary's 46\u201331\u20133 record in 1986\u201387 was good for third overall in the NHL, behind the Oilers and Philadelphia Flyers.","h_score":1982387.1312500001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":23615827,"revid":1170192718,"description":"National Hockey League team in Alberta, Canada","categories":["1980 establishments in Alberta","Calgary Flames","Calgary Sports and Entertainment","Ice hockey clubs established in 1980","National Hockey League in Alberta","National Hockey League teams","National Hockey League teams based in Canada","Pacific Division (NHL)"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\n\ud83d\udd25 *The Calgary Flames aren\u2019t just a team\u2014they\u2019re a city\u2019s heartbeat.* From the Saddledome\u2019s roar to the 1989 Cup run, this franchise is built on grit, glory, and a few *very* dramatic collapses.

Until the 1990s, he wore combat boots, but due to orthopedic issues, abandoned them for sneakers and tennis shoes instead. Around his waist, he often carried a 9mm Browning pistol in a brown leather holster with an additional three clips. His personal weapon of choice was a 7.62 Kalashnikov AKM which Castro occasionally carried with him during the 1960s but was later kept stored in a suitcase carried by one of the members of his escort or kept placed between his feet while driving along with five cartridges; he frequently used it during shooting exercises and practice. Castro had a lifelong love of guns and was considered an expert sharpshooter, impressing foreign visitors and even holding up against members of his own elite bodyguards who engaged in frequent competition with him. Castro's most iconic public feature eventually became the Cuban cigar that he smoked on a daily basis. Introduced to it by his father at the age of 15, Castro continued the habit for almost 44 years with the exception of a brief period during the 1950s while a guerrilla fighter and boycotting against Batista-linked tobacco firms. Castro claimed that he quit around 1985 during an anti-smoking campaign promoted by the Communist Party. S\u00e1nchez disputes this, saying that his doctor had Castro reduce his cigar usage starting in 1980 and quit entirely in 1983 after a cancerous ulcer was found in his intestine. Prior to the Revolution, Castro smoked various brands including Romeo y Julieta Churchill, H. Upmann, Bauza, and Partag\u00e1s. In the early 1960s, Castro saw one of his bodyguards smoking a noticeably aromatic but unbranded cigar. Castro and the bodyguard located the cigar maker, Eduardo Ribera, who agreed to establish the El Laguito Factory and branded the cigars as Cohiba which became Castro's signature brand and elevating its profile internationally. Initially restricted for his own private use and other members of the Politburo, it was later presented as diplomatic gifts for allied countries and friends of Castro, most notably seen smoked by Che Guevara, Josip Broz Tito, Houari Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne, Sukarno, and Saddam Hussein.","h_score":2227465.125,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":38301,"revid":1173204296,"description":"Leader of Cuba from 1959 to 2008","categories":["1926 births","2016 deaths","20th-century Cuban lawyers","20th-century atheists","21st-century atheists","Anti-Americanism","Anti-capitalists","Anti-imperialism","Collaborators with the Soviet Union","Cuban Marxist writers","Cuban guerrillas","Cuban nationalists","Cuban people of Canarian descent","Cuban people of Galician descent","Cuban people of Spanish descent","Cuban revolutionaries","Cuban soldiers","Fidel Castro","Fidel Castro family","First Secretaries of the Communist Party of Cuba","Foreign Heroes of the Soviet Union","Government ministers of Cuba","Leaders who took power by coup","National Heroes of North Korea","People from Mayar\u00ed","People of the Cold War","People of the Cuban Revolution","Political party founders","Politicide perpetrators","Presidents of Cuba","Recipients of the Lenin Peace Prize","Recipients of the Order of Lenin","Recipients of the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise, 1st class","Secretaries-General of the Non-Aligned Movement","University of Havana alumni"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Fidel Castro: The Revolutionary Leader Who Shaped Cuba for Half a Century\"**\n\n*Cuba\u2019s iconic leader ruled for nearly five decades, blending socialist ideology with fierce anti-imperialism\u2014leaving a legacy of both admiration and controversy.*\n\n---\n\n**A Rise to Power Through Revolution**\nFidel Castro seized control of Cuba in 1959 after overthrowing U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista.

It is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge. Nickel is a hard and ductile transition metal. Pure nickel is chemically reactive, but large pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because a passivation layer of nickel oxide forms on the surface that prevents further corrosion. Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickel\u2013iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.\n\nMeteoric nickel is found in combination with iron, a reflection of the origin of those elements as major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis. An iron\u2013nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth's outer and inner cores.\n\nUse of nickel (as natural meteoric nickel\u2013iron alloy) has been traced as far back as 3500 BCE. Nickel was first isolated and classified as an element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral, in the cobalt mines of Los, H\u00e4lsingland, Sweden. The element's name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick). Nickel minerals were green, like copper ores, and were known as kupfernickel - Nickel's copper - because they produced no copper. An economically important source of nickel is the iron ore limonite, which is often 1\u20132% nickel. Other important nickel ore minerals include pentlandite and a mix of Ni-rich natural silicates known as garnierite. Major production sites include the Sudbury region, Canada (which is thought to be of meteoric origin), New Caledonia in the Pacific, and Norilsk, Russia.\n\nNickel is one of four elements (the others are iron, cobalt, and gadolinium) that are ferromagnetic at about room temperature. Alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron-based permanent magnets and rare-earth magnets. The metal is used chiefly in alloys and corrosion-resistant plating. About 68% of world production is used in stainless steel. A further 10% is used for nickel-based and copper-based alloys, 9% for plating, 7% for alloy steels, 3% in foundries, and 4% in other applications such as in rechargeable batteries, including those in electric vehicles (EVs). Nickel is widely used in coins, though nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy. As a compound, nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses, such as a catalyst for hydrogenation, cathodes for rechargeable batteries, pigments and metal surface treatments. Nickel is an essential nutrient for some microorganisms and plants that have enzymes with nickel as an active site.\n\n ## Properties\n\n ### Atomic and physical properties\n\nNickel is a silvery-white metal with a slight golden tinge that takes a high polish. It is one of only four elements that are ferromagnetic at or near room temperature; the others are iron, cobalt and gadolinium. Its Curie temperature is 355 \u00b0C (671 \u00b0F), meaning that bulk nickel is non-magnetic above this temperature. The unit cell of nickel is a face-centered cube with the lattice parameter of 0.352 nm, giving an atomic radius of 0.124 nm. This crystal structure is stable to pressures of at least 70 GPa. Nickel is hard, malleable and ductile, and has a relatively high electrical and thermal conductivity for transition metals. The high compressive strength of 34 GPa, predicted for ideal crystals, is never obtained in the real bulk material due to formation and movement of dislocations. However, it has been reached in Ni nanoparticles.\n\n","h_score":2294417.5375000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":21274,"revid":1172579539,"description":null,"categories":["Chemical elements","Chemical elements with face-centered cubic structure","Dietary minerals","Ferromagnetic materials","IARC Group 2B carcinogens","Native element minerals","Nickel","Transition metals"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Nickel: The Metal That Powers Your Phone\u2014and Maybe the Future\"**\n\n*From batteries to coins, this unassuming element is everywhere\u2014yet its supply chain is a ticking time bomb.*\n\n---\n\n**The Silent Workhorse**\nNickel isn\u2019t flashy, but it\u2019s the backbone of modern life. It\u2019s in your phone\u2019s battery, your electric car\u2019s motor, and even the stainless steel of your kitchen sink. \"Without nickel, the energy transition stalls,\" says Dr. Elena Vasquez, a materials scientist at MIT. \"It\u2019s the unsung hero of the green revolution.\"\n\n---\n\n**The Dirty Secret**\nBut nickel\u2019s rise comes with a cost.

It claimed to offer people the possibility of happiness and freedom from suffering in an age of uncertainty. Although there was never an official Cynic doctrine, the fundamental principles of Cynicism can be summarized as follows: - The goal of life is eudaimonia and mental clarity or lucidity (\u1f01\u03c4\u03c5\u03c6\u03b9\u03b1)\u2014literally \"freedom from smoke (\u03c4\u03cd\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2)\" which signified false belief, mindlessness, folly, and conceit. - Eudaimonia is achieved by living in accord with Nature as understood by human reason. - Arrogance (\u03c4\u03cd\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2) is caused by false judgments of value, which cause negative emotions, unnatural desires, and a vicious character. - Eudaimonia, or human flourishing, depends on self-sufficiency (\u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1), equanimity, arete, love of humanity, parrhesia, and indifference to the vicissitudes of life (adiaphora \u1f01\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1). - One progresses towards flourishing and clarity through ascetic practices (\u1f04\u03c3\u03ba\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2) which help one become free from influences such as wealth, fame, and power that have no value in Nature. Instead they promoted living a life of ponos. For the Cynics, this did not seem to mean actual physical work. Diogenes of Sinope, for example, lived by begging, not by doing manual labor. Rather, it means deliberately choosing a hard life\u2014for instance, wearing only a thin cloak and going barefoot in winter. - A Cynic practices shamelessness or impudence (\u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) and defaces the nomos of society: the laws, customs, and social conventions that people take for granted. Thus a Cynic has no property and rejects all conventional values of money, fame, power and reputation. A life lived according to nature requires only the bare necessities required for existence, and one can become free by unshackling oneself from any needs which are the result of convention. The Cynics adopted Heracles as their hero, as epitomizing the ideal Cynic. Heracles \"was he who brought Cerberus, the hound of Hades, from the underworld, a point of special appeal to the dog-man, Diogenes.\" According to Lucian, \"Cerberus and Cynic are surely related through the dog.\" The Cynic way of life required continuous training, not just in exercising judgments and mental impressions, but a physical training as well: > [Diogenes] used to say, that there were two kinds of exercise: that, namely, of the mind and that of the body; and that the latter of these created in the mind such quick and agile impressions at the time of its performance, as very much facilitated the practice of virtue; but that one was imperfect without the other, since the health and vigour necessary for the practice of what is good, depend equally on both mind and body. None of this meant that a Cynic would retreat from society. Cynics were in fact to live in the full glare of the public's gaze and be quite indifferent in the face of any insults which might result from their unconventional behaviour. The Cynics are said to have invented the idea of cosmopolitanism: when he was asked where he came from, Diogenes replied that he was \"a citizen of the world, (kosmopolit\u00eas).\" The ideal Cynic would evangelise; as the watchdog of humanity, they thought it was their duty to hound people about the error of their ways. The example of the Cynic's life (and the use of the Cynic's biting satire) would dig up and expose the pretensions which lay at the root of everyday conventions. Although Cynicism concentrated primarily on ethics, some Cynics, such as Monimus, addressed epistemology with regard to tuphos (\u03c4\u1fe6\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2) expressing skeptical views. Cynic philosophy had a major impact on the Hellenistic world, ultimately becoming an important influence for Stoicism. The Stoic Apollodorus, writing in the 2nd century BC, stated that \"Cynicism is the short path to virtue.\" ## History of Cynicism\n\nThe classical Greek and Roman Cynics regarded virtue as the only necessity for happiness, and saw virtue as entirely sufficient for attaining it. Classical Cynics followed this philosophy to the extent of neglecting everything not furthering their perfection of virtue and attainment of happiness, thus, the title of Cynic, derived from the Greek word \u03ba\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd (meaning \"dog\") because they allegedly neglected society, hygiene, family, money, etc., in a manner reminiscent of dogs. They sought to free themselves from conventions; become self-sufficient; and live only in accordance with nature. They rejected any conventional notions of happiness involving money, power, and fame, to lead entirely virtuous, and thus happy, lives.\n\nThe ancient Cynics rejected conventional social values, and would criticise the types of behaviours, such as greed, which they viewed as causing suffering. Emphasis on this aspect of their teachings led, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, to the modern understanding of cynicism as \"an attitude of scornful or jaded negativity, especially a general distrust of the integrity or professed motives of others.\" This modern definition of cynicism is in marked contrast to the ancient philosophy, which emphasized \"virtue and moral freedom in liberation from desire.\"\n\n ### Influences\n\nVarious philosophers, such as the Pythagoreans, had advocated simple living in the centuries preceding the Cynics. In the early 6th century BC, Anacharsis, a Scythian sage, had combined plain living together with criticisms of Greek customs in a manner which would become standard among the Cynics. Perhaps of importance were tales of Indian philosophers, known as gymnosophists, who had adopted a strict asceticism. By the 5th century BC, the sophists had begun a process of questioning many aspects of Greek society such as religion, law and ethics. However, the most immediate influence for the Cynic school was Socrates. Although he was not an ascetic, he did profess a love of virtue and an indifference to wealth, together with a disdain for general opinion. These aspects of Socrates' thought, which formed only a minor part of Plato's philosophy, became the central inspiration for another of Socrates' pupils, Antisthenes.\n\n ### Symbolisms\n\nCynics were often recognized in the ancient world by their apparel\u2014an old cloak and a staff. The cloak came as an allusion to Socrates and his manner of dress, while the staff was to the club of Heracles. These items became so symbolic of the Cynic vocation that ancient writers accosted those who thought that donning the Cynic garb would make them suited to the philosophy.\n\nIn the social evolution from the archaic age to the classical, the public ceased carrying weapons into the poleis. Originally it was expected that one carried a sword while in the city. However, a transition to spears and then to staffs occurred until wearing any weapon in the city became a foolish old custom. Thus, the very act of carrying a staff was slightly taboo itself. According to modern theorists, the symbol of the staff was one which both functions as a tool to signal the user's dissociation from physical labour, that is, as a display of conspicuous leisure, and at the same time it also has an association with sport and typically plays a part in hunting and sports clothing. Thus, it displays active and warlike qualities, rather than being a symbol of a weak man's need to support himself. The staff itself became a message of how the Cynic was free through its possible interpretation as an item of leisure, but, just as equivalent, was its message of strength\u2014a virtue held in abundance by the Cynic philosopher.\n\n ### Antisthenes\n\nThe story of Cynicism traditionally begins with Antisthenes (c. 445\u2013365 BC), who was an older contemporary of Plato and a pupil of Socrates. About 25 years his junior, Antisthenes was one of the most important of Socrates' disciples. Although later classical authors had little doubt about labelling him as the founder of Cynicism, his philosophical views seem to be more complex than the later simplicities of pure Cynicism. In the list of works ascribed to Antisthenes by Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, writings on language, dialogue and literature far outnumber those on ethics or politics, although they may reflect how his philosophical interests changed with time. It is certainly true that Antisthenes preached a life of poverty:\n\n> I have enough to eat till my hunger is stayed, to drink till my thirst is sated; to clothe myself as well; and out of doors not [even] Callias there, with all his riches, is more safe than I from shivering; and when I find myself indoors, what warmer shirting do I need than my bare walls?\n\n ### Diogenes of Sinope\n\nDiogenes (c. 412\u2013323 BC) dominates the story of Cynicism like no other figure. He originally went to Athens, fleeing his home city, after he and his father, who was in charge of the mint at Sinope, got into trouble for falsifying the coinage. (The phrase \"defacing the currency\" later became proverbial in describing Diogenes' rejection of conventional values.) Later tradition claimed that Diogenes became the disciple of Antisthenes, but it is by no means certain that they ever met. Diogenes did however adopt Antisthenes' teachings and the ascetic way of life, pursuing a life of self-sufficiency (autarkeia), austerity (ask\u0113sis), and shamelessness (anaideia). There are many anecdotes about his extreme asceticism (sleeping in a tub), his shameless behaviour (eating raw meat), and his criticism of conventional society (\"bad people obey their lusts as servants obey their masters\"), and although it is impossible to tell which of these stories are true, they do illustrate the broad character of the man, including an ethical seriousness.\n\n ### Crates of Thebes\n\nCrates of Thebes (c. 365\u2013c. 285 BC) is the third figure who dominates Cynic history. He is notable because he renounced a large fortune to live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens. He is said to have been a pupil of Diogenes, but again this is uncertain. Crates married Hipparchia of Maroneia after she had fallen in love with him and together they lived like beggars on the streets of Athens, where Crates was treated with respect. Crates' later fame (apart from his unconventional lifestyle) lies in the fact that he became the teacher of Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism. The Cynic strain to be found in early Stoicism (such as Zeno's own radical views on sexual equality spelled out in his Republic) can be ascribed to Crates' influence.\n\n ### Other Cynics\n\nThere were many other Cynics in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, including Onesicritus (who sailed with Alexander the Great to India), the skeptic Monimus, the moral satirist Bion of Borysthenes, the legislator Cercidas of Megalopolis, the diatribist Teles and Menippus of Gadara. However, with the rise of Stoicism in the 3rd century BC, Cynicism as a serious philosophical activity underwent a decline, and it is not until the Roman era that Cynicism underwent a revival in the first century AD.\n\n","h_score":2003957.28125,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":19187131,"revid":1173860079,"description":"Ancient school of philosophy","categories":["Asceticism","Cynicism"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nWhat if the world\u2019s a joke\u2014and the punchline is *you*?

The rabbis also thought that the reason for the death of Sarah was the news of the intended sacrifice of Isaac. The sacrifice of Isaac is cited in appeals for the mercy of God in later Jewish traditions. The post-biblical Jewish interpretations often elaborate the role of Isaac beyond the biblical description and primarily focus on Abraham's intended sacrifice of Isaac, called the aqedah (\"binding\"). According to a version of these interpretations, Isaac died in the sacrifice and was revived. According to many accounts of Aggadah, unlike the Bible, it is Satan who is testing Isaac as an agent of God. Isaac's willingness to follow God's command at the cost of his death has been a model for many Jews who preferred martyrdom to violation of the Jewish law.\n\nAccording to the Jewish tradition, Isaac instituted the afternoon prayer. This tradition is based on Genesis chapter 24, verse 63 (\"Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide\").\n\nIsaac was the only patriarch who stayed in Canaan during his whole life and though once he tried to leave, God told him not to do so. Rabbinic tradition gave the explanation that Isaac was almost sacrificed and anything dedicated as a sacrifice may not leave the Land of Israel. Isaac was the oldest of the biblical patriarchs at the time of his death, and the only patriarch whose name was not changed.\n\nRabbinic literature also linked Isaac's blindness in old age, as stated in the Bible, to the sacrificial binding: Isaac's eyes went blind because the tears of angels present at the time of his sacrifice fell on Isaac's eyes.\n\n ## Christian views\n\nThe early Christian church continued and developed the New Testament theme of Isaac as a type of Christ and the Church being both \"the son of the promise\" and the \"father of the faithful\". Tertullian draws a parallel between Isaac's bearing the wood for the sacrificial fire with Christ's carrying his cross. and there was a general agreement that, while all the sacrifices of the Old Law were anticipations of that on Calvary, the sacrifice of Isaac was so \"in a pre-eminent way\".\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church consider Isaac as a saint along with other biblical patriarchs. Along with those of other patriarchs and the Old Testament Righteous, his feast day is celebrated in the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Byzantine rite of the Catholic Church on the Second Sunday before Christmas (December 11\u201317), under the title the Sunday of the Forefathers.\n\nIsaac is commemorated in the Catholic Church on 25 March or on 17 December.\n\n ### New Testament\n\nThe New Testament states Isaac was \"offered up\" by his father Abraham, and that Isaac blessed his sons. Paul contrasted Isaac, symbolizing Christian liberty, with the rejected older son Ishmael, symbolizing slavery; Hagar is associated with the Sinai covenant, while Sarah is associated with the covenant of grace, into which her son Isaac enters. The Epistle of James chapter 2, verses 21\u201324, states that the sacrifice of Isaac shows that justification (in the Johannine sense) requires both faith and works.\n\nIn the Epistle to the Hebrews, Abraham's willingness to follow God's command to sacrifice Isaac is used as an example of faith as is Isaac's action in blessing Jacob and Esau with reference to the future promised by God to Abraham. In verse 19, the author views the release of Isaac from sacrifice as analogous to the resurrection of Jesus, the idea of the sacrifice of Isaac being a prefigurement of the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross.\n\n","h_score":2084639.6812500001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":15192,"revid":1171752735,"description":"Biblical patriarch, son of Abraham and Sarah","categories":["Biblical patriarchs","Catholic saints","Children of Abraham","Christian saints from the Old Testament","Eastern Orthodox saints","Esau","Isaac","Mythological blind people","People whose existence is disputed","Vayeira"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Isaac: The AI Tool Reshaping How We Work\u2014and What It Means for the Future\"**\n\n*Meet Isaac, the AI assistant designed to automate complex tasks\u2014from drafting reports to analyzing data\u2014while raising questions about productivity, ethics, and the evolving role of human workers.*\n\n---\n\n### **What Isaac Does**\nIsaac is an AI-powered tool built to handle repetitive and analytical tasks, such as summarizing documents, generating code, or crunching spreadsheets.

The political system has three branches\u2014legislative, executive and judicial, with universal suffrage for citizens at least 18 years old. The Constitution also provides possibilities of direct democracy, namely petitions and national referendums. Elections are supervised by an independent Central Election Commission that includes members from all major political parties. Parties must register with the commission prior to participating in a national election. Normally, the prime minister-elect is the leader of the party receiving the most votes in parliamentary elections, although this is not always the case. Unlike the prime minister, presidential domestic power is more limited. The directly elected president serves as head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and has the authority to return a bill for further debate, although the parliament can override the presidential veto by a simple majority vote. Political parties gather in the National Assembly, a body of 240 deputies elected to four-year terms by direct popular vote. The National Assembly has the power to enact laws, approve the budget, schedule presidential elections, select and dismiss the prime minister and other ministers, declare war, deploy troops abroad, and ratify international treaties and agreements. Overall, Bulgaria displays a pattern of unstable governments. Boyko Borisov, the leader of the centre-right, pro-EU party GERB, served three terms as prime minister between 2009 and 2021. It won the 2009 general election and formed a minority government, which resigned in February 2013 after nationwide protests over the low living standards, corruption and the perceived failure of the democratic system. The subsequent snap elections in May resulted in a narrow win for GERB, but the Bulgarian Socialist Party eventually formed a government led by Plamen Oresharski after Borisov failed to secure parliamentary support. The Oresharski government resigned in July 2014 amid continuing large-scale protests. The October 2014 elections resulted in a third GERB victory. Borisov formed a coalition with several right-wing parties, but resigned again after the candidate backed by his party failed to win the 2016 Presidential election. The March 2017 snap election was again won by GERB, but with 95 seats in Parliament. They formed a coalition with the far-right United Patriots, who held 27 seats. Borisov's last cabinet saw a dramatic decrease in freedom of the press, and a number of corruption revelations that triggered yet another wave of mass protests in 2020. GERB came out first in the regular April 2021 election, but with its weakest result so far. All other parties refused to form a government, and after a brief deadlock, another election was called for July 2021. It too failed to break the stalemate, as no political party was able to form a coalition government. In April 2023, because of the political deadlock, Bulgaria held its fifth parliamentary election since April 2021. GERB was the biggest, winning 69 seats. The bloc led by We Continue the Change won 64 seats in the 240-seat parliament. In June 2023, Prime Minister Nikolai Denkov formed a new coalition between We Continue The Change and GERB. According to the coalition agreement, Denkov will lead the government for the first nine months. He will be succeeded by former European Commissioner, Mariya Gabriel, of the GERB party. She will take over as Prime Minister after nine months. Freedom House has reported a continuing deterioration of democratic governance after 2009, citing reduced media independence, stalled reforms, abuse of authority at the highest level and increased dependence of local administrations on the central government. Bulgaria is still listed as \"Free\", with a political system designated as a semi-consolidated democracy, albeit with deteriorating scores. The Democracy Index defines it as a \"Flawed democracy\". A 2018 survey by the Institute for Economics and Peace reported that less than 15% of respondents considered elections to be fair. ### Legal system\n\nBulgaria has a civil law legal system. The judiciary is overseen by the Ministry of Justice. The Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court of Cassation are the highest courts of appeal and oversee the application of laws in subordinate courts. The Supreme Judicial Council manages the system and appoints judges. The legal system is regarded by both domestic and international observers as one of Europe's most inefficient due to pervasive lack of transparency and corruption. Law enforcement is carried out by organisations mainly subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior. The General Directorate of National Police (GDNP) combats general crime and maintains public order. GDNP fields 26,578 police officers in its local and national sections. The bulk of criminal cases are transport-related, followed by theft and drug-related crime; homicide rates are low. The Ministry of the Interior also heads the Border Police Service and the National Gendarmerie\u2014a specialised branch for anti-terrorist activity, crisis management and riot control. Counterintelligence and national security are the responsibility of the State Agency for National Security.\n\n ### Administrative divisions\n\nBulgaria is a unitary state. Since the 1880s, the number of territorial management units has varied from seven to 26. Between 1987 and 1999, the administrative structure consisted of nine provinces (oblasti, singular oblast). A new administrative structure was adopted in parallel with the decentralisation of the economic system. It includes 27 provinces and a metropolitan capital province (Sofia-Grad). All areas take their names from their respective capital cities. The provinces are subdivided into 265 municipalities. Municipalities are run by mayors, who are elected to four-year terms, and by directly elected municipal councils. Bulgaria is a highly centralised state where the Council of Ministers directly appoints regional governors and all provinces and municipalities are heavily dependent on it for funding.\n\n ### Foreign relations\n\nBulgaria became a member of the United Nations in 1955 and since 1966 has been a non-permanent member of the Security Council three times, most recently from 2002 to 2003. It was also among the founding nations of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in 1975. Euro-Atlantic integration has been a priority since the fall of communism, although the communist leadership also had aspirations of leaving the Warsaw Pact and joining the European Communities by 1987. Bulgaria signed the European Union Treaty of Accession on 25 April 2005, and became a full member of the European Union on 1 January 2007. In addition, it has a tripartite economic and diplomatic collaboration with Romania and Greece, good ties with China and Vietnam and a historical relationship with Russia.\n\nBulgaria deployed significant numbers of both civilian and military advisors in Soviet-allied countries like Nicaragua and Libya during the Cold War. The first deployment of foreign troops on Bulgarian soil since World War II occurred in 2001, when the country hosted six KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft and 200 support personnel for the war effort in Afghanistan. International military relations were further expanded with accession to NATO in March 2004 and the US-Bulgarian Defence Cooperation Agreement signed in April 2006. Bezmer and Graf Ignatievo air bases, the Novo Selo training range, and a logistics centre in Aytos subsequently became joint military training facilities cooperatively used by the United States and Bulgarian militaries. Despite its active international defence collaborations, Bulgaria ranks as among the most peaceful countries globally, tying 6th alongside Iceland regarding domestic and international conflicts, and 26th on average in the Global Peace Index.\n\n ### Military\n\nThe Bulgarian Armed Forces are the military of Bulgaria and they are composed of land forces, navy and an air force. The Armed Forces have 36,950 active troops, supplemented by 3,000 reservists. The land forces consist of two mechanised brigades and eight independent regiments and battalions; the air force operates 106 aircraft and air defence systems across six air bases, and the navy operates various ships, helicopters and coastal defence weapons. Military inventory mainly consists of Soviet equipment like Mikoyan MiG-29 and Sukhoi Su-25 jets, S-300PT air defence systems and SS-21 Scarab short-range ballistic missiles.\n\n","h_score":2481508.0125000002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":3415,"revid":1173837169,"description":"Country in Southeast Europe","categories":["Balkan countries","Bulgaria","Countries and territories where Bulgarian is an official language","Countries in Europe","Member states of NATO","Member states of the European Union","Member states of the Three Seas Initiative","Member states of the Union for the Mediterranean","Member states of the United Nations","Republics","States and territories established in 1990"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nBulgaria isn\u2019t just Europe\u2019s best-kept secret\u2014it\u2019s a time machine.

Columbia accidentally released an alternate take of \"From a Buick 6\" on an early pressing of Highway 61 Revisited, and this version continued to appear on the Japanese release for several years. Other outtakes officially released between 1991 and 2005 include alternate takes of \"Like a Rolling Stone\" and \"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry\", and a previously unreleased song, \"Sitting on a Barbed Wire Fence\", on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1\u20133 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961\u20131991, as well as alternate takes of \"Desolation Row\", \"Highway 61 Revisited\", \"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\", \"Tombstone Blues\", and \"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry\" on The Bootleg Series Volume 7. Excerpts from several different takes of \"Like a Rolling Stone\" appeared on the Highway 61 Interactive CD-ROM, released in February 1995. In 2015, Dylan released Volume 12 of his Bootleg Series, The Cutting Edge, in three different formats. The 18-disc Collector's Edition was described as including \"every note recorded during the 1965\u20131966 sessions, every alternate take and alternate lyric\". The 18 CDs contain every take of every song recorded in the studio during the Highway 61 Revisited sessions, from June 15 to August 4, 1965. The Highway 61 Revisited out-takes from the first recording session in New York, June 15 and 16, 1965 comprise: ten takes of \"It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry\", six takes of \"Sitting On A Barbed-Wire Fence\", and fifteen takes of \"Like A Rolling Stone\". Additionally, The Cutting Edge contains four instrumental \"stem\" tracks, lifted from Take Four which was the released \"Master take\" of \"Like A Rolling Stone\": Guitar (Mike Bloomfield); vocal, guitar (Bob Dylan), piano and bass; drums and organ. The tracks from the second recording session in New York, July 29 to August 4, 1965, comprise seven takes of \"It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry\", sixteen takes of \"Tombstone Blues\", twelve takes of \"Positively Fourth Street\", five takes of \"From A Buick 6\", seventeen takes of \"Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?\", nine takes of \"Highway 61 Revisited\", sixteen takes of \"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\", seven takes of Queen Jane Approximately\", and eight takes of \"Desolation Row\". Describing the process of listening to these many alternative versions, Chris Gerard wrote in PopMatters: \"The fact that these versions do not approach the greatness of the final recordings is exactly the point. These are works in progress. It\u2019s a guided tour through the creative process that led to these landmark albums.\" ## Artwork and packaging\n\nThe cover artwork was photographed by Daniel Kramer several weeks before the recording sessions. Kramer captured Dylan sitting on the stoop of the apartment of his manager, Albert Grossman, located in Gramercy Park, New York, placing Dylan's friend Bob Neuwirth behind Dylan \"to give it extra color\". Dylan wears a Triumph motorcycle T-shirt under a blue and purple silk shirt, holding his Ray-Ban sunglasses in his right hand. Photographer Kramer commented in 2010 on the singer's expression: \"He's hostile, or it's a hostile moodiness. He's almost challenging me or you or whoever's looking at it: 'What are you gonna do about it, buster?'\"\n\nAs he had on his previous three albums, Dylan contributed his own writing to the back cover of Highway 61 Revisited, in the shape of freeform, surrealist prose: \"On the slow train time does not interfere & at the Arabian crossing waits White Heap, the man from the newspaper & behind him the hundred inevitables made of solid rock & stone.\" One critic has pointed out the close similarity of these notes to the stream of consciousness, experimental novel Tarantula, which Dylan was writing during 1965 and 1966.\n\n","h_score":1871121.78125,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":145975,"revid":1166466009,"description":null,"categories":["1965 albums","Albums produced by Bob Johnston","Albums produced by Tom Wilson (record producer)","Blues rock albums by American artists","Bob Dylan albums","Columbia Records albums","Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Highway 61 Revisited: How a Legendary Album Still Shapes Music Today\"**\n\n*Bob Dylan\u2019s 1965 masterpiece redefined rock, folk, and protest music\u2014yet its influence persists in unexpected ways, from modern songwriting to political movements.*\n\n---\n\n### **A Cultural Turning Point**\n*Highway 61 Revisited* arrived at a moment of social upheaval, blending electric rock with Dylan\u2019s poetic lyricism.

In many cases, individual institutions were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates. By 1209 the situation showed no signs of resolution, and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he did not acquiesce to Langton's appointment. When this threat failed, Innocent excommunicated the King in November 1209. Although theoretically a significant blow to John's legitimacy, this did not appear to worry the King greatly. Two of John's close allies, Emperor Otto IV and Count Raymond VI of Toulouse, had already suffered the same punishment themselves, and the significance of excommunication had been somewhat devalued. John simply tightened his existing measures and accrued significant sums from the income of vacant sees and abbeys: one 1213 estimate, for example, suggested the church had lost an estimated 100,000 marks (equivalent to \u00a366,666 at the time) to John. Official figures suggest that around 14% of annual income from the English church was being appropriated by John each year. Innocent gave some dispensations as the crisis progressed. Monastic communities were allowed to celebrate Mass in private from 1209 onwards, and late in 1212 the Holy Viaticum for the dying was authorised. The rules on burials and lay access to churches appear to have been steadily circumvented, at least unofficially. Although the interdict was a burden to much of the population, it did not result in rebellion against John. By 1213, though, John was increasingly worried about the threat of French invasion. Some contemporary chroniclers suggested that in January Philip II of France had been charged with deposing John on behalf of the papacy, although it appears that Innocent merely prepared secret letters in case Innocent needed to claim the credit if Philip did successfully invade England. Under mounting political pressure, John finally negotiated terms for a reconciliation, and the papal terms for submission were accepted in the presence of the papal legate Pandulf Verraccio in May 1213 at the Templar Church at Dover. As part of the deal, John offered to surrender the Kingdom of England to the papacy for a feudal service of 1,000 marks (equivalent to \u00a3666 at the time) annually: 700 marks (\u00a3466) for England and 300 marks (\u00a3200) for Ireland, as well as recompensing the Church for revenue lost during the crisis. The agreement was formalised in the Bulla Aurea, or Golden Bull. This resolution produced mixed responses. Although some chroniclers felt that John had been humiliated by the sequence of events, there was little public reaction. Innocent benefited from the resolution of his long-standing English problem, but John probably gained more, as Innocent became a firm supporter of John for the rest of his reign, backing him in both domestic and continental policy issues. Innocent immediately turned against Philip, calling upon him to reject plans to invade England and to sue for peace. John paid some of the compensation money he had promised the Church, but he ceased making payments in late 1214, leaving two-thirds of the sum unpaid; Innocent appears to have conveniently forgotten this debt for the good of the wider relationship. ## Failure in France and the First Barons' War (1215\u20131216)\n\n ### Tensions and discontent\n\nTensions between John and the barons had been growing for several years, as demonstrated by the 1212 plot against the King. Many of the disaffected barons came from the north of England; that faction was often labelled by contemporaries and historians as \"the Northerners\". The northern barons rarely had any personal stake in the conflict in France, and many of them owed large sums of money to John; the revolt has been characterised as \"a rebellion of the king's debtors\". Many of John's military household joined the rebels, particularly amongst those that John had appointed to administrative roles across England; their local links and loyalties outweighed their personal loyalty to John. Tension also grew across North Wales, where opposition to the 1211 treaty between John and Llywelyn was turning into open conflict. For some the appointment of Peter des Roches as justiciar was an important factor, as he was considered an \"abrasive foreigner\" by many of the barons. The failure of John's French military campaign in 1214 was probably the final straw that precipitated the baronial uprising during John's final years as king; James Holt describes the path to civil war as \"direct, short and unavoidable\" following the defeat at Bouvines.\n\n ### Failure of the 1214 French campaign\n\nIn 1214 John began his final campaign to reclaim Normandy from Philip. He was optimistic, as he had successfully built up alliances with the Emperor Otto, Renaud of Boulogne and Ferdinand of Flanders; he was enjoying papal favour; and he had successfully built up substantial funds to pay for the deployment of his experienced army. Nonetheless, when John left for Poitou in February 1214, many barons refused to provide military service; mercenary knights had to fill the gaps. John's plan was to split Philip's forces by pushing north-east from Poitou towards Paris, whilst Otto, Renaud and Ferdinand, supported by William Longesp\u00e9e, marched south-west from Flanders.\n\nThe first part of the campaign went well, with John outmanoeuvring the forces under the command of Prince Louis and retaking the county of Anjou by the end of June. John besieged the castle of Roche-au-Moine, a key stronghold, forcing Louis to give battle against John's larger army. The local Angevin nobles refused to advance with John; left at something of a disadvantage, John retreated back to La Rochelle. Shortly afterwards, King Philip won the hard-fought battle of Bouvines in the north against Otto and John's other allies, bringing an end to John's hopes of retaking Normandy. A peace agreement was signed in which John returned Anjou to Philip and paid him compensation; the truce was intended to last for six years. John arrived back in England in October.\n\n","h_score":2202463.7124999999,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":16550,"revid":1173118429,"description":"King of England from 1199 to 1216","categories":["1166 births","1216 deaths","12th-century Dukes of Normandy","12th-century English monarchs","13th-century Dukes of Normandy","13th-century English monarchs","13th-century peers of France","Burials at Worcester Cathedral","Children of Henry II of England","Deaths from dysentery","Earls of Cornwall","Earls of Gloucester","English people of French descent","English people of Scottish descent","High Sheriffs of Somerset","House of Anjou","House of Plantagenet","Infectious disease deaths in England","John, King of England","Lords of Glamorgan","Medieval governors of Guernsey","People from Oxford","People of the Barons' Wars","People temporarily excommunicated by the Catholic Church","Proto-Protestants","Robin Hood characters"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\n*\"John Lackland\"*\u2014the king who lost more than his temper.

By 27 April, Berlin's communication had been all but cut off from the rest of Germany. Secure radio contact with defending units had been lost; the command staff in the F\u00fchrerbunker had to depend on telephone lines for passing instructions and orders, and on public radio for news and information. On 28 April, Hitler received a BBC report originating from Reuters: it stated that Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler had offered to surrender to the Western Allies. The offer was declined. Himmler had implied to the Allies that he had the authority to negotiate a surrender, which Hitler considered to be treason. That afternoon, Hitler's anger and bitterness escalated into a rage against Himmler. He ordered Himmler's arrest and had Hermann Fegelein (Himmler's SS representative at Hitler's headquarters) shot for desertion. By this time, the Red Army had advanced to the Potsdamer Platz, roughly a kilometre away from the bunker, and all indications were that they were preparing to storm the Reich Chancellery. This report and Himmler's treachery prompted Hitler to make the last decisions of his life. Shortly after midnight on 29 April, he married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony in a map room within the F\u00fchrerbunker. The two then hosted a modest wedding breakfast, after which Hitler took secretary Traudl Junge to another room and dictated his last will and testament. It left instructions to be carried out immediately following his death, with Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz and Joseph Goebbels assuming Hitler's roles as head of state and chancellor, respectively. Hitler signed these documents at 04:00 and then went to bed. Some sources say that he dictated the last will and testament immediately before the wedding, but all agree on the timing of the signing. On the afternoon of 29 April, Hitler learned that his ally, Benito Mussolini, had been executed by Italian partisans. The bodies of Mussolini and his mistress, Clara Petacci, had been strung up by their heels. The corpses were later cut down and thrown into the gutter, where they were mocked by Italian dissidents. These events may have strengthened Hitler's resolve not to allow himself or his wife to be made a \"spectacle\" of, as he had earlier recorded in his testament. Hitler had been given some capsules of prussic acid by Himmler through SS physician Ludwig Stumpfegger, and initially had intended to use them for his suicide. When he received the news that Himmler had contacted the Allies through a Swedish diplomat to arrange for an end to the war, Hitler was outraged. With this betrayal in his mind, Hitler began to doubt whether the ampoules would be effective. He ordered Haase to test one on his dog Blondi. The capsule worked \u2013 the dog died instantly.","h_score":2203443.3125,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":1033897,"revid":1172566832,"description":"1945 suicide of Nazi dictator","categories":["1945 deaths","1945 suicides","Adolf Hitler","April 1945 events in Europe","Battle of Berlin","Death of Adolf Hitler","Deaths by person in Germany","People declared dead in absentia","Suicides in Germany"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"Adolf Hitler\u2019s Death: The Final Hours of the Third Reich\"**\n\n*On April 30, 1945, as Soviet forces closed in on Berlin, Adolf Hitler\u2014leader of Nazi Germany\u2014committed suicide in his bunker.

Flying foxes have been cited as particularly destructive to almonds, guavas, and mangoes in the Maldives; lychee in Mauritius; areca in India; and stone fruits in Australia. Orchard damages from other animals are often misattributed to flying foxes, though, and economic damage can be difficult to quantify or exaggerated. To prevent fruit damage, farmers may legally or illegally cull flying foxes. In the 1800s, the Australian government paid farmers bounties to kill flying foxes, though the practice has since been discontinued. Alternatives to culling include placing barriers between the bats and fruit trees, such as netting, or harvesting fruit in a timely manner to avoid attracting as many flying foxes. Netting is the most effective way to prevent crop loss, though some farmers find it cost prohibitive. It costs US\\$4,400\u201344,000 to net 1 ha (2.5 acres) of crops. Other methods of preventing fruit loss may also involve the use of scare guns, chemical deterrents, or night-time lights. Alternatively, planting Singapore cherry trees and other decoy crops next to an orchard can be effective, as flying foxes are much more attracted to their fruits than many other orchard crops.\n\nThe location of flying fox camps can be a disturbance to humans. In Batemans Bay, Australia, locals report being so disturbed by flying fox vocalizations in the morning that they lose sleep. Flying foxes can fly into power lines and cause electricity outages. Their guano and body odor are also unpleasant to smell. The presence of flying fox colonies can cause nearby property values to decline.\n\n","h_score":1926544.28125,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":3345164,"revid":1170764944,"description":"Genus of large bats","categories":["Articles containing video clips","Bat genera","Bats of Africa","Bats of Asia","Fauna of Southeast Asia","Mammals of Thailand","Pteropus","Taxa named by Mathurin Jacques Brisson"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nMeet the **Pteropus**\u2014the flying fox.

The population grew in parallel with the development of many fine buildings in the city as merchants benefitted from their shipping routes from Norway to Portugal. In 1663, the city suffered yet another serious fire, which destroyed the tower of Budolfi Church.\n\nDuring the second half of the 18th century, Aalborg entered a further period of prosperity. In Erik Pontoppidan's Danske Atlas (Danish Atlas) it was described as \"after Copenhagen, the best and most prosperous market town in Denmark\". The population grew from 4,160 in 1769 to 5,579 in 1801. In 1767, the second newspaper ever published in Denmark appeared in the city.\n\nAfter Denmark ceded Norway to Sweden in 1814, Aalborg lost its important role as the country's centre for Norwegian trade. Its former prosperity also suffered as a result of difficulties with the herring industry as the fish disappeared after the sea breached the Agger Tange (which had linked Thy with the rest of Jutland at the western end of Limfjord) in the 1825 North Sea storm. The after effects of the state bankruptcy in 1813 also contributed to widespread poverty in the city. In the mid-19th-century, Aalborg was overtaken by Aarhus as the largest city in Jutland. Towards the end of the 19th century there was however an upturn. In 1865, the pontoon bridge over Limfjord was completed, and in 1869, the railway reached the city with a railway bridge over the sound to Vendsyssel three years later. The harbour facilities were also improved, making Aalborg Denmark's second port. Aalborg became the country's main producer of tobacco products and spirits, followed in the 1890s by fertilisers and cement. By 1901, the population had increased to almost 31,500.\n\n","h_score":2065859.9812500002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":5479136,"revid":1172390937,"description":null,"categories":["Aalborg","Aalborg Municipality","Cities and towns in the North Jutland Region","Limfjord","Municipal seats of Denmark","Municipal seats of the North Jutland Region","Populated places established in the 1st millennium","Port cities and towns in Denmark","Port cities and towns of the North Sea","Viking Age populated places"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**Aalborg: Denmark\u2019s Green Pioneer with a Vibrant Student Pulse**\n\n*Aalborg, Denmark\u2019s second-largest city, is a model of sustainable urban living and a hub for innovation, driven by its young population and bold climate goals.

He was nominated by President Bill Clinton, and replaced retiring justice Harry Blackmun. Ketanji Brown Jackson, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, was his designated successor. Breyer was generally associated with the liberal wing of the Court. He is now the Byrne Professor of Administrative Law and Process at Harvard Law School.\n\nBorn in San Francisco, Breyer attended Stanford University, the University of Oxford as a Marshall Scholar, and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1964. After a clerkship with Associate Justice Arthur Goldberg in 1964\u201365, Breyer was a law professor and lecturer at Harvard Law School from 1967 until 1980. He specialized in administrative law, writing textbooks that remain in use today. He held other prominent positions before being nominated to the Supreme Court, including special assistant to the United States Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust and assistant special prosecutor on the Watergate Special Prosecution Force in 1973. Breyer became a federal judge in 1980, when he was appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In his 2005 book Active Liberty, Breyer made his first attempt to systematically communicate his views on legal theory, arguing that the judiciary should seek to resolve issues in a manner that encourages popular participation in governmental decisions.\n\nOn January 27, 2022, Breyer and President Joe Biden announced Breyer's intention to retire from the Supreme Court. On February 25, 2022, Biden nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and one of Breyer's former law clerks, to succeed him. The Senate confirmed Jackson on April 7, 2022, by a vote of 53\u201347. Breyer remained on the Supreme Court until June 30, 2022.

Shaw then read George's book Progress and Poverty, which awakened his interest in economics. He began attending meetings of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), where he discovered the writings of Karl Marx, and thereafter spent much of 1883 reading Das Kapital. He was not impressed by the SDF's founder, H. M. Hyndman, whom he found autocratic, ill-tempered and lacking leadership qualities. Shaw doubted the ability of the SDF to harness the working classes into an effective radical movement and did not join it\u2014he preferred, he said, to work with his intellectual equals.\n\nAfter reading a tract, Why Are The Many Poor?, issued by the recently formed Fabian Society, Shaw went to the society's next advertised meeting, on 16 May 1884. He became a member in September, and before the year's end had provided the society with its first manifesto, published as Fabian Tract No. 2. He joined the society's executive committee in January 1885, and later that year recruited Webb and also Annie Besant, a fine orator.\n\nFrom 1885 to 1889 Shaw attended the fortnightly meetings of the British Economic Association; it was, Holroyd observes, \"the closest Shaw had ever come to university education\". This experience changed his political ideas; he moved away from Marxism and became an apostle of gradualism. When in 1886\u201387 the Fabians debated whether to embrace anarchism, as advocated by Charlotte Wilson, Besant and others, Shaw joined the majority in rejecting this approach. After a rally in Trafalgar Square addressed by Besant was violently broken up by the authorities on 13 November 1887 (\"Bloody Sunday\"), Shaw became convinced of the folly of attempting to challenge police power. Thereafter he largely accepted the principle of \"permeation\" as advocated by Webb: the notion whereby socialism could best be achieved by infiltration of people and ideas into existing political parties.\n\nThroughout the 1880s the Fabian Society remained small, its message of moderation frequently unheard among more strident voices. Its profile was raised in 1889 with the publication of Fabian Essays in Socialism, edited by Shaw who also provided two of the essays. The second of these, \"Transition\", details the case for gradualism and permeation, asserting that \"the necessity for cautious and gradual change must be obvious to everyone\". In 1890 Shaw produced Tract No. 13, What Socialism Is, a revision of an earlier tract in which Charlotte Wilson had defined socialism in anarchistic terms. In Shaw's new version, readers were assured that \"socialism can be brought about in a perfectly constitutional manner by democratic institutions\".\n\n","h_score":2234171.3374999999,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":12855,"revid":1173415645,"description":"Irish playwright, critic, and polemicist (1856\u20131950)","categories":["1856 births","1950 deaths","19th-century British dramatists and playwrights","19th-century Irish dramatists and playwrights","19th-century male writers","20th-century British dramatists and playwrights","20th-century British male writers","20th-century British screenwriters","20th-century Irish dramatists and playwrights","Accidental deaths from falls","Accidental deaths in England","Anti-vivisectionists","Articles containing video clips","Best Adapted Screenplay Academy Award winners","British Nobel laureates","British eugenicists","British male dramatists and playwrights","British music critics","British screenwriters","British socialists","Burials at Ayot St Lawrence","Classical music critics","Deaths from kidney failure","English-language spelling reform advocates","Fellows of the Royal Society of Literature","George Bernard Shaw","Holodomor deniers","Irish Dominion League","Irish Nobel laureates","Irish anti-vaccination activists","Irish male dramatists and playwrights","Irish music critics","Irish people of English descent","Irish screenwriters","Irish socialists","Members of St Pancras Metropolitan Borough Council","Members of the Fabian Society","Nobel laureates in Literature","PEN International","People associated with RADA","People associated with the British Museum","People associated with the London School of Economics","People educated at Wesley College, Dublin","People from Ayot St Lawrence","People from Portobello, Dublin","Victorian novelists","Writers from Dublin (city)"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nMeet George Bernard Shaw: playwright, polemicist, and the man who made *wit* a weapon.

He is typically portrayed as an anthropomorphic egg, though he is not explicitly described as such. The first recorded versions of the rhyme date from late eighteenth-century England and the tune from 1870 in James William Elliott's National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs. Its origins are obscure, and several theories have been advanced to suggest original meanings.\n\nHumpty Dumpty was popularized in the United States on Broadway by actor George L. Fox in the pantomime musical Humpty Dumpty. The show ran from 1868 to 1869, for a total of 483 performances. As a character and literary allusion, Humpty Dumpty has appeared or been referred to in many works of literature and popular culture, particularly English author Lewis Carroll's 1871 book Through the Looking-Glass, in which he was described as an egg. The rhyme is listed in the Roud Folk Song Index as No. 13026.\n\n ## Lyrics and melody\n\nThe rhyme is one of the best known in the English language. The common text from 1882 is:\n\n> > Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. All the king's horses and all the king's men Couldn't put Humpty together again.\n\nIt is a single quatrain with external rhymes that follow the pattern of AABB and with a trochaic metre, which is common in nursery rhymes. The melody commonly associated with the rhyme was first recorded by composer and nursery rhyme collector James William Elliott in his National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs (London, 1870), as outlined below:\n\n","h_score":1935098.425,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":45915,"revid":1164563980,"description":"Nursery rhyme character","categories":["1797 songs","Action songs","Cultural depictions of Richard III of England","Eggs in culture","English children's songs","English folk songs","English nursery rhymes","Lewis Carroll characters","Riddles","Songs about fictional male characters","Traditional children's songs"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\n\ud83e\udd5a *Crack.* That\u2019s the sound of a nursery rhyme mystery.

He also declined to take part in an artistic competition prior to the announcement of his commission, and wanted to withdraw from the project when it was announced that neither Matisse nor Picasso would be painting at the RCA Building. He eventually acquiesced after Nelson convinced Hood to remove his grayscale requirement and allowed Rivera to paint Man at the Crossroads in a fresco format. However, Rivera withdrew again after Sert and Brangwyn were announced as the new artists, calling them \"two inferior painters\". He eventually rejoined the project by fall 1932. As part of the contract, Rivera would be paid \\$21,000 for the work. This was considerably more than the \\$10,000 he had been paid for Detroit Industry, which he continued painting even as he was negotiating for Man at the Crossroads. According to Daniel Okrent, Rivera did not read the fine print of the contract that he signed, which stipulated that in exchange for the \\$21,000, Rockefeller Center Inc. would hold full ownership of Man at the Crossroads; this would lead to a controversy when the work was later removed from the RCA Building. Rivera showed Abby the sketch of his proposed work in November 1932. Nelson and John also looked at the sketch, and Nelson concluded that there was nothing controversial about the planned mural. Rivera and the Rockefellers signed a contract in which they agreed that the sketch was the final plan for the mural, and that the completed work could not be different from what was on that sketch. In March 1933, Rivera traveled from Detroit to New York so he could work on the RCA Building mural. He employed artists from around the world in his six-person crew, which also included the artists Ben Shahn and Lucienne Bloch. Rivera's assistants converted his small sketch to full-size 1-square-foot (0.093 m<sup>2<\/sup>) pieces of tracing paper, which would then be painted onto the wall. Also in March 1933, Webster B. Todd, one of the contractors working on the construction of Rockefeller Center, requested sketches of Man at the Crossroads because he was concerned about the mural's potential controversial effect. Even so, Rivera did not express worry about any potential issues, even expressing pride over his work when The New York Times wrote a lengthy profile on him on April 2, 1933. The Rockefellers did not show concern either, and the complex's publicist Merle Crowell took credit for the New York Times article.","h_score":1896222.8562500002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":2310660,"revid":1169949357,"description":"Fresco by Diego Rivera","categories":["1930s murals","1934 in New York City","1934 paintings","Cultural depictions of Vladimir Lenin","Fresco paintings in the United States","Lost paintings","Marxist works","Murals in New York City","Painting controversies","Paintings by Diego Rivera","Rockefeller Center"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**\"At the Crossroads: The Man Who Decided the Future\"**\n\n*One moment can reshape a life\u2014or a nation.

Within these colonies, they most often nest in groups of 10 to 30 (or rarely 100) individuals. Breeding can occur at any time of year, often prompted by commencement of the dry season or plentiful food.\n\nFrigatebirds have the most elaborate mating displays of all seabirds. The male birds take up residence in the colony in groups of up to thirty individuals. They display to females flying overhead by pointing their bills upwards, inflating their red throat pouches and vibrating their outstretched wings, showing the lighter wing undersurfaces in the process. They produce a drumming sound by vibrating their bills together and sometimes give a whistling call. The female descends to join a male she has chosen and allows him to take her bill in his. The pair also engages in mutual \"head-snaking\".\n\nAfter copulation it is generally the male who gathers sticks and the female that constructs the loosely woven nest. The nest is subsequently covered with (and cemented by) guano. Frigatebirds prefer to nest in trees or bushes, though when these are not available they will nest on the ground. A single white egg that weighs up to 6\u20137% of mother's body mass is laid, and is incubated in turns by both birds for 41 to 55 days. The altricial chicks are naked on hatching and develop a white down. They are continuously guarded by the parents for the first 4\u20136 weeks and are fed on the nest for 5\u20136 months. Both parents take turns feeding for the first three months, after which the male's attendance trails off leaving the mother to feed the young for another six to nine months on average. The chicks feed by reaching their heads in their parents' throat and eating the part-regurgitated food. It takes so long to rear a chick that frigatebirds generally breed every other year.\n\nThe duration of parental care in frigatebirds is among the longest for birds, rivalled only by the southern ground hornbill and some large accipitrids. Frigatebirds take many years to reach sexual maturity. A study of great frigatebirds in the Galapagos Islands found that they only bred once they have acquired the full adult plumage. This was attained by female birds when they were eight to nine years of age and by male birds when they were ten to eleven years of age.\n\n","h_score":1881844.75,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":183143,"revid":1169993868,"description":"Family of seabirds (Fregatidae)","categories":["Extant Ypresian first appearances","Fregata","Fregatidae","Pleistocene animals of Africa","Pleistocene animals of Asia","Pleistocene animals of Oceania","Pleistocene animals of South America","Pleistocene birds","Pleistocene birds of North America","Seabirds","Taxa named by Bernard Germain de Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nImagine a bird so *dramatic* it makes seagulls look like shy librarians.

She was laid down at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg in 1906 and launched on 5 October 1907. The Oberb\u00fcrgermeister of her namesake city, Otto Beutler, christened the ship. Fitting-out work then commenced, and Dresden was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 14 November 1908. Following her commissioning, Dresden began her sea trials. On 28 November she accidentally collided with and sank the Swedish galeas C\u00e4cilie outside Kiel. Dresden's starboard propeller shaft was shoved in 30 mm (1.2 in), and she required six months of repair work. She resumed sea trials in 1909, but a turbine accident necessitated further repairs, which lasted until September. Although Dresden had not completed the required testing, her trials were declared over on 7 September, as she had been ordered to visit the United States. The purpose of the voyage was to represent Germany at the Hudson\u2013Fulton Celebration in New York; Dresden was joined by the protected cruisers Hertha and Victoria Louise and the light cruiser Bremen. Dresden left Wilhelmshaven on 11 September and stopped in Newport, where she met the rest of the ships of the squadron. The ships arrived in New York on 24 September, remained there until 9 October, and arrived back in Germany on 22 October. Dresden then joined the reconnaissance force for the High Seas Fleet; the following two years consisted of the peacetime routine of squadron exercises, training cruises, and annual fleet exercises. On 16 February 1910, she collided with the light cruiser K\u00f6nigsberg. The collision caused significant damage to Dresden, though no one on either vessel was injured. She made it back to Kiel for repairs, which lasted eight days. Dresden visited Hamburg on 13\u201317 May that year. From 14 to 20 April 1912, she was temporarily transferred to the Training Squadron, along with the armored cruiser Friedrich Carl and the light cruiser Mainz. For the year 1911\u201312, Dresden won the Kaiser's Schie\u00dfpreis (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery amongst the light cruisers of the High Seas Fleet. From September 1912 through September 1913, she was commanded by Fregattenkapit\u00e4n (Frigate Captain) Fritz L\u00fcdecke, who would command the ship again during World War I. On 6 April 1913, she and the cruiser Strassburg were sent from Kiel to the Adriatic Sea, where she joined the Mittelmeer-Division (Mediterranean Division), centered on the battlecruiser Goeben and commanded by Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Konrad Trummler. The ships cruised the eastern Mediterranean for several months, and in late August, Dresden was ordered to return to Germany. After arriving in Kiel on 23 September, she was taken into the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) for an overhaul that lasted until the end of December.","h_score":2035384.0,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":420993,"revid":1168994724,"description":"Light cruiser of the German Imperial Navy","categories":["1907 ships","1915 in Chile","Dresden-class cruisers","Scuttled vessels of Germany","Ships built in Hamburg","Shipwrecks in the Chilean Sea","World War I commerce raiders","World War I cruisers of Germany","World War I shipwrecks in the Pacific Ocean"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nPicture this: 1907.

The subfamily Ursinae experienced a dramatic proliferation of taxa about 5.3\u20134.5 Mya, coincident with major environmental changes; the first members of the genus Ursus appeared around this time. The sloth bear is a modern survivor of one of the earliest lineages to diverge during this radiation event (5.3 Mya); it took on its peculiar morphology, related to its diet of termites and ants, no later than by the early Pleistocene. By 3\u20134 Mya, the species Ursus minimus appears in the fossil record of Europe; apart from its size, it was nearly identical to today's Asian black bear. It is likely ancestral to all bears within Ursinae, perhaps aside from the sloth bear. Two lineages evolved from U.minimus: the black bears (including the sun bear, the Asian black bear, and the American black bear); and the brown bears (which includes the polar bear). Modern brown bears evolved from U.minimus via Ursus etruscus, which itself is ancestral to the extinct Pleistocene cave bear. Species of Ursinae have migrated repeatedly into North America from Eurasia as early as 4 Mya during the early Pliocene. The polar bear is the most recently evolved species and descended from a population of brown bears that became isolated in northern latitudes by glaciation 400,000 years ago.","h_score":2208055.6125000003,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":4400,"revid":1173564579,"description":"Family of carnivoran mammals","categories":["Articles containing video clips","Bears","Extant Eocene first appearances","Predators","Taxa named by Gotthelf Fischer von Waldheim"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nMeet the bear\u2014nature\u2019s original powerhouse. 800 lbs of muscle, a nose that smells honey from *miles* away, and a walk that shakes the forest floor.

They have been regarded as having little in common except their nationality and their relationship has varied over time. Their rivalry began during their junior years when they were both considered promising young talents. They started out as friends and won the Belgian Junior Championships as doubles partners at ages ten and eleven respectively, despite only being able to communicate with hand signals due to Clijsters not knowing French and Henin not knowing Flemish. However, their friendship began to fade by their mid-teens, leading to disputes that their coaches would try to keep out of the media. Clijsters attributed this deterioration in part to one of Henin's coaches telling Henin, \"she had to hate all of her opponents, and only then could she win.\" She also acknowledged they had very different personalities.\n\nClijsters and Henin typically downplayed any disagreements between them, saying they were overdramatized by the media. When they were professionals, Clijsters accused Henin of routinely faking injuries in their matches to receive medical timeouts. Additionally, Clijsters's father seemed to allege that Henin was taking performance-enhancing drugs. Although they had won the Fed Cup together in 2001, they were not interested in playing on the same team in 2004 or 2005. The following year, Clijsters's former coach Carl Maes, who was then the Belgium Fed Cup captain, helped convince Clijsters to reunite with Henin, and together they ultimately reached another final.\n\nOn the court, they played each other in 25 WTA matches, making each of them the other's most frequent opponent. Although Clijsters won the series 13\u201312, Henin won seven out of their eleven meetings in finals including all three at Grand Slam tournaments. The latest stage win Clijsters had at a major was in the semifinals of the 2001 French Open. She also defeated Henin en route to her first WTA Tour Championship in 2002. Clijsters dominated their hard court meetings 8\u20134, while Henin dominated on clay 5\u20131. Henin also won three of their five grass court encounters. Before both of their first retirements, Henin was leading the series 12\u201310.

This is a small metal furnace containing nozzles for the fiber to be formed through. It is almost always made of platinum alloyed with rhodium for durability. Platinum is used because the glass melt has a natural affinity for wetting it. When bushings were first used they were 100% platinum, and the glass wetted the bushing so easily that it ran under the plate after exiting the nozzle and accumulated on the underside. Also, due to its cost and the tendency to wear, the platinum was alloyed with rhodium. In the direct melt process, the bushing serves as a collector for the molten glass. It is heated slightly to keep the glass at the correct temperature for fiber formation. In the marble melt process, the bushing acts more like a furnace as it melts more of the material.\n\nBushings are the major expense in fiber glass production. The nozzle design is also critical. The number of nozzles ranges from 200 to 4000 in multiples of 200. The important part of the nozzle in continuous filament manufacture is the thickness of its walls in the exit region. It was found that inserting a counterbore here reduced wetting. Today, the nozzles are designed to have a minimum thickness at the exit. As glass flows through the nozzle, it forms a drop which is suspended from the end. As it falls, it leaves a thread attached by the meniscus to the nozzle as long as the viscosity is in the correct range for fiber formation. The smaller the annular ring of the nozzle and the thinner the wall at exit, the faster the drop will form and fall away, and the lower its tendency to wet the vertical part of the nozzle. The surface tension of the glass is what influences the formation of the meniscus. For E-glass it should be around 400 mN\/m.\n\nThe attenuation (drawing) speed is important in the nozzle design. Although slowing this speed down can make coarser fiber, it is uneconomic to run at speeds for which the nozzles were not designed.\n\n ### Continuous filament process\n\nIn the continuous filament process, after the fiber is drawn, a size is applied. This size helps protect the fiber as it is wound onto a bobbin. The particular size applied relates to end-use. While some sizes are processing aids, others make the fiber have an affinity for a certain resin, if the fiber is to be used in a composite. Size is usually added at 0.5\u20132.0% by weight. Winding then takes place at around 1 km\/min.\n\n ### Staple fiber process\n\nFor staple fiber production, there are a number of ways to manufacture the fiber. The glass can be blown or blasted with heat or steam after exiting the formation machine. Usually these fibers are made into some sort of mat. The most common process used is the rotary process. Here, the glass enters a rotating spinner, and due to centrifugal force is thrown out horizontally. The air jets push it down vertically, and binder is applied. Then the mat is vacuumed to a screen and the binder is cured in the oven.\n\n","h_score":1879028.3687500001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":157606,"revid":1164867226,"description":"Material consisting of numerous extremely fine fibers of glass","categories":["1938 introductions","Building insulation materials","Composite materials","Glass production","Glass types","Synthetic fibers"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nEver wondered what makes your Wi-Fi *actually* fast?

At the recommendation of his relative Gaius Septimius Severus, the emperor Marcus Aurelius (r. 161\u2013180) granted him entry into the senatorial ranks. Membership in the senatorial order was a prerequisite to attain positions within the cursus honorum and to gain entry into the Roman Senate. Nevertheless, it appears that Severus' career during the 160s met with some difficulties.\n\nIt is likely that he served as a vigintivir in Rome, overseeing road maintenance in or near the city, and he may have appeared in court as an advocate. At the time of Marcus Aurelius, he was the State Attorney (Advocatus fisci). However, he omitted the military tribunate from the cursus honorum and had to delay his quaestorship until he had reached the required minimum age of 25. To make matters worse, the Antonine Plague swept through the capital in 166.\n\nWith his career at a halt, Severus decided to temporarily return to Leptis, where the climate was healthier. According to the Historia Augusta, a usually unreliable source, he was prosecuted for adultery during this time but the case was ultimately dismissed. At the end of 169, Severus was of the required age to become a quaestor and journeyed back to Rome. On 5 December, he took office and was officially enrolled in the Roman Senate. Between 170 and 180 his activities went largely unrecorded, in spite of the fact that he occupied an impressive number of posts in quick succession. The Antonine Plague had thinned the senatorial ranks and, with capable men now in short supply, Severus' career advanced more steadily than it otherwise might have.\n\nThe sudden death of his father necessitated another return to Leptis Magna to settle family affairs. Before he was able to leave Africa, Mauri tribesmen invaded southern Spain. Control of the province was handed over to the emperor, while the Senate gained temporary control of Sardinia as compensation. Thus, Septimius Severus spent the remainder of his second term as quaestor on the island of Sardinia.\n\nIn 173, Severus' kinsman Gaius Septimius Severus was appointed proconsul of the Province of Africa. The elder Severus chose his cousin as one of his two legati pro praetore, a senior military appointment. Following the end of this term, Septimius Severus returned to Rome, taking up office as tribune of the plebs, a senior legislative position, with the distinction of being the candidatus of the emperor.\n\n","h_score":2160190.9750000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":28413,"revid":1171884073,"description":"Roman emperor from 193 to 211","categories":["145 births","211 deaths","2nd-century Punic people","2nd-century Roman emperors","3rd-century Punic people","3rd-century Roman emperors","Ancient Libyans","Ancient Romans in Britain","Burials at the Castel Sant'Angelo","Deified Roman emperors","Imperial Roman consuls","People of the Roman\u2013Parthian Wars","Roman governors of Gallia Lugdunensis","Roman pharaohs","Romans from Africa","Septimii","Septimius Severus","Severan dynasty"],"task":"SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"**1\/10**\nMeet **Septimius Severus**\u2014the first African Roman emperor (193\u2013211 AD).
