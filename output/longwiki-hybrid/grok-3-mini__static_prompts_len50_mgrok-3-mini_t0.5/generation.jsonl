Reflecting on his early years in the league, Javie told Sports Illustrated in October 2000, \"I'd get so mad I'd lose control for two or three minutes, and that's when I would miss calls.\" Javie developed mentorships with referees Joe Crawford and Jack Madden to assist in the maturation process. Working his debut game with Crawford at the Pontiac Silverdome in Detroit, Michigan, Javie received a grade of 40 points out of 100 by supervisor Darell Garretson. While reviewing game film later at the hotel, Crawford noted errors made throughout the game by himself. As a result of this film study, Javie learned that experienced officials make mistakes and admitting error will improve a referee's ability in the long-term. Ninety minutes after the conclusion of a game, Javie reviews game film. In addition to film review, Madden taught Javie not to lose focus when players and coaches were upset, and to walk away from them rather than becoming angry. Javie credited his mentors for success as a referee saying, \"My mentors have made me what I am today. I'm a little part of each of them. It's their success in teaching me.\" Javie had an on-court incident during the 1990\u201391 NBA season in a game between the Portland Trail Blazers and Washington Bullets. Bullets' forward Pervis Ellison threw the ball at referee Billy Spooner prompting Javie to run across the court to impose a technical foul on Ellison. In the sequence of events that followed, Javie ejected Ellison after protesting the call, the Bullets' head coach Wes Unseld for protesting the dismissal of Ellison, and the Bullets' mascot, \"Hoops\", for making gestures to incite the crowd. Rod Thorn, then the NBA's vice president for operations, ruled that Javie overreacted in ejecting Ellison and would be subject to discipline. The extent of the disciplinary action was not disclosed. Javie reflected on the experience saying, \"My fatal mistake was getting involved with Billy [Spooner] and Pervis [Ellison] in the first place. You have to be there for your partners, but most of the time you've got to let them call their game.\" Nearly three years later in another game involving the Portland Trail Blazers, Trail Blazers radio broadcast analyst Mike Rice was ejected by Javie for disputing calls from his broadcast position. During the 2002\u201303 NBA season, Javie was fined \\$1,000 by the league for a verbal altercation with Pat Riley, then-head coach of the Miami Heat. In April 2003, Javie was the referee in Michael Jordan's final game of his fifteen-year NBA career. During a game break towards the end of regulation, Javie congratulated Jordan on his career and told him he was a \"class act\". Javie then turned around and told the younger players on the court, \"You could do a lot worse than modeling yourselves after this guy.\" #### Income tax evasion trial\n\nIn January 1999, Javie was the only one of fifteen referees to be acquitted of tax evasion charges as a result of not reporting income he received by downgrading airline tickets provided by the league. Other referees were sentenced to probation or a period of house arrest, and ordered to pay the taxes. He fought the charges because he believed he did not intentionally do anything wrong. Discussing the trial, Javie told Referee magazine, \"My job is about my name. My dad taught me your name is the most important thing. I had to fight for my name.\" During the trial, Javie argued that he didn't owe taxes on more than \\$84,000 in income over three years because the money was value-earned from frequent flyer miles, which are non-taxable. He later described the trial as \"the hardest two weeks\" of his life.\n\n #### Retirement\n\nJavie announced his retirement before the beginning of the 2011\u201312 season.\n\nOn June 22, 2017, Javie was one of four new inductees into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame in Troy, Michigan. He was the recipient of Sports Faith International's Father Smyth Award on May 22, 2021.\n\nHe is a permanent deacon in the Catholic Church.\n\n ### Media career\n\nIn June 2012, it was announced that Javie would join NBA on ESPN, serving as a rules analyst working marquee games during the season and throughout the NBA Playoffs. Javie also appears on ESPN programming to discuss controversial referee occurrences.","h_score":1635285.4812500002,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":5111492,"revid":1162123304,"description":"American basketball referee (born 1955)","categories":["1955 births","American people of Polish descent","ESPN people","Living people","National Basketball Association referees","Sportspeople from Philadelphia","Temple University alumni"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Steve Javie?  \nA1: Steve Javie is a former NBA referee.  \n\nQ2: What was his main role in the NBA?  \nA2: He officiated basketball games as a referee.  \n\nQ3: How long was his NBA career?  \nA3: He worked as a referee for over 25 years.  \n\nQ4: What are some career highlights?  \nA4: He officiated multiple NBA Finals and All-Star games.  \n\nQ5: What does he do now?  \nA5: He serves as an NBA rules analyst for ESPN.  \n\nQ6: How has he influenced refereeing?  \nA6: He provides expert commentary on rules and decisions.  \n\nQ7: What challenges did he face?  \nA7: He dealt with high-pressure games and criticism.  \n\nQ8: What is his legacy in basketball?  \nA8: He is respected for accuracy and contributions to the sport."}

There are six servants, and one mill of 10s. There are ten acres of meadow and thirty acres of pasture. In the time of the Confessor, it was worth 40 shillings when he received it four pounds, now 100 shillings. In the time of king Edward the Confessor, two men, Leuuin and Uluuin, held this land in coparcenary, and could turn themselves over with this land to whomever they would.\" Thus there were three manors within the parish; Ditton Manor, with the appendant Brampton Manor, and Sifletone, all of which were owned by the Bishop of Bayeux at this time. The Bishop of Bayeaux was Odo, Earl of Kent, half brother of William the Conqueror. In 1082, after it was discovered that Odo planned a military expedition to Italy, he was imprisoned, and his estates (including Ditton, Brampton, and Sifletone) were confiscated to the Crown. Following this, Ditton Manor appears to have been held by the Clares, earls of Gloucester, by a family who assumed their surname from Ditton. Likewise, Sifletone was confiscated and went to another family who took their surname from it. Ditton has a ford which, along with St Peter's Ad Vincula's Church, is situated in a conservation area on the west of a large green. The church is dated to the 12th century with a later 14th-century tower, and the first bell of Ditton church was hung there in 1656. Ditton parish register has as its opening words, \"The Register book of Ditton beginning Anno Dom. 1663. William Jole, rector, inducted Rector of Ditton, 1st August, Anno Dom. 1663. \" Also at the commencement, it is recorded, on 1 August 1711, that every acre of woodland in the parish of Ditton by immemorial custom pays tithe to the rector. In 1798 Ditton was recorded as being within the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Diocese of Rochester, and deanery of Malling. This parish, among others, was obliged to contribute to the repair of the fifth pier of Rochester bridge. The church was restored in 1860 by Sir George Gilbert Scott. The north nave window has fragments of fourteenth-century glass, and the nave has a good selection of hanging wall monuments and a benefactions board. A lead plaque on the nave wall, removed from the tower roof in 1859, has a picture of a ship from Nelson's time scratched on it. The mill that was recorded in the Domesday Book, Church Mill, was located close to the ford and closed down around 1912. In 1798 the parish was described in the following terms: \"The high road from London, through Wrotham, to Maidstone, crosses the middle of it, at the thirty-first milestone;","h_score":1585807.84375,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":6843140,"revid":1162207172,"description":null,"categories":["Civil parishes in Kent","Local Nature Reserves in Kent","Villages in Kent"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Ditton, Kent?  \nA1: Ditton is a village in Kent, England.  \n\nQ2: Where is it located?  \nA2: It lies near Maidstone in southeastern England.  \n\nQ3: What is its history?  \nA3: Ditton dates back to the Domesday Book and has rural roots.  \n\nQ4: How large is the population?  \nA4: It has around 1,000 residents, based on recent estimates.  \n\nQ5: What attractions does it offer?  \nA5: Key sites include historic churches and walking paths.  \n\nQ6: What is the local economy like?  \nA6: It relies on agriculture and nearby urban jobs in Kent.  \n\nQ7: Are there community events?  \nA7: Annual fairs and village meetings foster local engagement.  \n\nQ8: Why is Ditton notable?  \nA8: It features on the Pilgrims' Way and preserves rural heritage."}

He said \"It was a dream to join the team I have supported all my life\". The Daily Mirror printed that \"Hughes has red hair, tattoos of a Tasmanian devil and a British bulldog on his forearms, dynamite in his boots and Albion in his blood.\" Fans affectionately nicknamed him the \"Ginger Ninja\".\n\nHe made his debut at The Hawthorns as a substitute in a 2\u20131 win over Tranmere Rovers on 9 August 1997. Seven days later he scored two goals from the bench in a 3\u20132 win over Crewe Alexandra at Gresty Road. Though signed by Ray Harford, he came to the fore under new boss Denis Smith. Smith handed Hughes his first start on 28 December, in a 1\u20131 home draw with Stoke City. He finished his debut season as the club's top-scorer with 14 goals in 41 appearances, and was rewarded with a new four-year contract.\n\nHe started the 1998\u201399 season in fine form, and claimed his first ever hat-trick in a 3\u20130 win over Port Vale at Vale Park on 22 August. Despite having recently signed a long-term contract, his form and goal record led to constant rumours of a big money move to a host of Premier League clubs. West Brom eventually issued a \"hands-off\" warning to other clubs. He claimed further hat-tricks against Crystal Palace and Huddersfield Town, and finished the season with 32 goals in 45 games. This tally left him as the country's top-scorer. He was named on the PFA Team of the Year for the First Division. He then submitted a written transfer request, and his spokesman told the press that there have \"been a number of things going on behind the scenes which have unsettled him recently\". In particular, his \u00a31,400 a week salary was compared with the \u00a35,000 a week salary of under-performing teammate Fabian de Freitas.\n\nHe remained at the club for the 1999\u20132000 season and scored 17 goals in 43 appearances. Albion struggled in the First Division under new manager Brian Little, though improved after Gary Megson replaced Little as manager in March and avoided relegation despite Hughes missing the final five matches of the season due to a knee injury.\n\nHe was partnered with Jason Roberts for the 2000\u201301 season; the pair went on to score 40 goals between them to help secure the \"Baggies\" a play-off place. With 23 goals to his name, he again attracted interest from other clubs. He claimed two hat-tricks in seven days against Gillingham and Preston North End. Hughes converted a penalty in a 2\u20132 draw with Bolton Wanderers in the first leg of the play-off semi-final, before a 3\u20130 defeat at the Reebok Stadium ended Albion's play-off hopes. He refused to sign a new contract in July 2001, and was placed on the transfer list.\n\n ### Coventry City\n\nHughes was sold to Gordon Strachan's Coventry City for a club record transfer fee of \u00a35,000,001 (the unusual figure was because any offer exceeding \u00a35 million would trigger an escape clause in his West Brom contract) in August 2001. His wages at Highfield Road were reported to be \u00a315,000 a week. Hughes scored 14 goals in 40 games, including a hat-trick in a 6\u20131 win at Crewe Alexandra, and finished the 2001\u201302 season as the club's top-scorer. Coventry rejected a loan offer from West Bromwich Albion in March 2002, and ended the season outside the play-offs.\n\n ### Return to West Bromwich Albion\n\nIn August 2002, Hughes returned to West Bromwich Albion for a club record \u00a32.5 million \u2013 half the fee Albion had received for him a year earlier \u2013 and signed a four-year deal with the club. Despite being a regular in the first team, Hughes failed to score a single Premier League goal in the 2002\u201303 season and Albion were relegated in 19th place with just six wins and 26 points from 38 matches. Hughes was criticised by several teammates following the club's 1\u20130 defeat by Everton at Goodison Park, though was publicly backed by manager Gary Megson. He told the press that \"I want to establish myself in the Premiership and any accusations of me not pulling my weight should be made to my face.\" He put his poor form down to him missing pre-season training with injury problems. He rediscovered his form back in the First Division, scoring 12 goals in 36 games in 2003\u201304 as West Brom secured promotion with a second-place finish. His contract at West Bromwich Albion was immediately terminated in August 2004, following his conviction for causing death by dangerous driving. He spent the next three years in prison, serving half of his six-year sentence.\n\n","h_score":1607280.71875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":1623709,"revid":1171343796,"description":"English footballer (born 1976)","categories":["1976 births","AFC Telford United players","Blackpool F.C. players","Coventry City F.C. players","Cradley Town F.C. players","England men's semi-pro international footballers","English Football League players","English football managers","English men's footballers","English people convicted of assault","English prisoners and detainees","Footballers from Smethwick","Forest Green Rovers F.C. players","Grantham Town F.C. players","Halesowen Town F.C. managers","Halesowen Town F.C. players","Ilkeston F.C. players","Kidderminster Harriers F.C. players","Living people","Male criminals","Men's association football forwards","Men's association football player-managers","Mickleover F.C. players","Middlesex Wanderers A.F.C. players","National League (English football) players","Northern Premier League players","Notts County F.C. players","Nuneaton Borough F.C. players","Oldham Athletic A.F.C. players","Port Vale F.C. players","Premier League players","Prisoners and detainees of England and Wales","Southern Football League managers","Southern Football League players","Sportspeople convicted of crimes","Stourport Swifts F.C. players","West Bromwich Albion F.C. players","Worcester City F.C. managers","Worcester City F.C. players"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Lee Hughes?  \nA1: Lee Hughes is a former English professional footballer.

The film reunites Taylor with Stephen Dorff, who both starred in the 1996 film I Shot Andy Warhol. - Chris Adamson as Doctor Lang Chris Adamson's renewed interest in the horror film genre stemmed from his viewing of 1931's Frankenstein. To prepare for his role in Leatherface, he watched The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and the 2003 remake, preferring the former: \"It seemed to have an innocence somehow compared to some of the chopped up limb movies which I have sometimes worked on.\" The character Doctor Lang is the director of the mental institution from which Jedidiah Sawyer and the other inmates escape; the Gorman House Youth Reformery. - Finn Jones as Deputy Sorells Hal Hartman's fellow law enforcement officer. - James Bloor as Ike - Jessica Madsen as Clarice Clarice is one of the escaped inmates and was originally intended to be an homage to Chop Top Sawyer, a character from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, but was later developed into her own character. Sherwood stated that the \"DNA\" of Chop Top is present in Clarice, describing him as his favourite Sawyer. A revisionist take on Chop Top was added due to the diminished role of the family in earlier drafts of the script, but was removed when the filmmakers began to feel that she was more of a \"rip-off\" than a genuine tribute. The version of Clarice that appears in the final film emerged when Sherwood imagined \"an image of this little girl in pigtails burning down her house with her parents inside\". Out of all the performances in Leatherface, Sherwood called Jessica Madsen's the most accurate of what he envisioned while writing. Deciding that Clarice is \"much more than just a pyromaniac\", Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo removed scenes detailing her backstory, such as her weaponising fire for the first time, her addiction for watching moving flames, and exposition on her family's disappearance. As the film begins, it remains ambiguous as to which inmate is actually Jedidiah Sawyer, the eventual Leatherface. Maury and Bustillo even considered leading the audience to believe that Clarice could become the titular character, \"It wasn\u2019t a so crazy idea to have regarding the passion Leatherface had for dresses and makeup in the previous movies.\" - Sam Coleman as Bud Sam Coleman portrays Bud, a hulking mental patient that escapes the institution with Jackson, Clarice, and Ike. Additionally, Julian Kostov portrays Ted Hardesty in the film, the father of Sally and Franklin Hardesty, the final girl and her brother from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Although his role is brief, there was going to be an additional scene exploring his family that was removed for budgetary reasons. Nubbins Sawyer, the older brother of Leatherface known simply as \"The Hitchhiker\" in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, is played by Dejan Angelov. Lorina Kamburova fills the role of Hal Hartman's daughter, whose death sets the plot into motion, while Boris Kabakchief plays Jedidiah Sawyer in his child years.

Members took sides in the dispute, which led to synagogue disturbances, a contested election, and eventually to Ash's taking Rothstein to a United States court to try to oust him as president of the congregation. After the court rejected Ash's arguments, a large majority of members left with Ash to form Beth Hamedrash Hagodol (\"Great House of Study\"), adding the word \"Hagodol\" (\"Great\") to the original name. The followers of Rothstein stayed at the Allen Street location and retained the name \"Beth Hamedrash\" until the mid-1880s. With membership and financial resources both severely reduced, they were forced to merge with Congregation Holche Josher Wizaner; the combined congregation adopted the name \"Kahal Adath Jeshurun\", and built the Eldridge Street Synagogue. According to Eisenstein, Beth Hamedrash Hagodol provided an atmosphere that was \"socially religious\", in which Jews \"combine[d] piety with pleasure; they call[ed] their shule a shtibl or prayer-club room; they desire[d] to be on familiar terms with the Almighty and abhor[red] decorum; they want[ed] everyone present to join and chant the prayers; above all they scorn[ed] a regularly ordained cantor.\" In contrast to the informality of the services, members scrupulously observed the Jewish dietary laws, and every member personally oversaw the baking of his matzos for use on Passover. The congregation initially moved to the top floor of a building at the corner of Grand and Forsyth Streets, and in 1865 moved again, to a former courthouse on Clinton Street. In 1872, the congregation built a synagogue at Ludlow and Hester Streets. There the congregation's younger members gained greater control and introduced some minor innovations; for example, changing the title of parnas to president, and in 1877 hiring a professional cantor\u2014Judah Oberman\u2014for \\$500 (today \\$) per year, to bring greater formality and decorum to the services as well as to attract new members. While somewhat \"Americanized\", in general the congregation remained quite traditional. Men and women sat separately, the full service in the traditional prayer book was followed, and the congregation still trained men for rabbinic ordination. Additionally, Talmud and Mishna study groups, founded in the 1870s, were held both mornings and evenings. Ash had only served as Beth Hamedrash Hagodol's rabbi intermittently during this time; during the American Civil War he had briefly been a successful manufacturer of hoopskirts, before losing his money, and returning to the rabbinate. Congregants had a number of issues with him, including his outside business ventures and an alleged inclination towards Hasidism. The more learned members of the congregation contested his scholarship. Ash resigned as rabbi in 1877, and in 1879, directors of Beth Hamedrash Hagodol proposed that a Chief Rabbi be hired for New York. A number of New York City synagogues formed the \"United Hebrew Orthodox Congregations\", and agreed to select the Malbim (Me\u00efr Leibush ben Jehiel Michel Weiser) for the role. The appointment was announced in Philadelphia's Jewish Record, but the Malbim never filled the position. Beth Hamedrash Hagodol re-hired Ash to fill the vacant role of congregational rabbi at a salary of \\$25 per month (or \\$300\u2014today \\$\u2014per year). The following year the congregation hired a new cantor, Simhe Samuelson, for \\$1,000 (today \\$) a year, over three times Ash's salary.","h_score":1615624.6187500001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":10212125,"revid":1127278856,"description":"Synagogue in Manhattan, New York City","categories":["1852 establishments in New York (state)","Buildings and structures demolished in 2019","Churches completed in 1850","Demolished buildings and structures in Manhattan","Former New York City Designated Landmarks","Former churches in New York City","Former synagogues in New York (state)","Gothic Revival architecture in New York City","Gothic Revival synagogues","Lower East Side","New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan","Orthodox synagogues in New York City","Properties of religious function on the National Register of Historic Places in Manhattan","Religious organizations established in 1852","Russian-Jewish culture in New York City","Synagogues completed in 1885","Synagogues in Manhattan","Synagogues on the National Register of Historic Places in New York City","Ukrainian-Jewish culture in New York City"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Historic Synagogue Beth Hamedrash Hagodol in Ruins\n\nBeth Hamedrash Hagodol was a landmark Orthodox synagogue in New York City's Lower East Side, established in 1850 as a key Jewish community center.

Technical glitches prevent the team from setting off on their mission.

Umpired by former Cambridge rower James Crowden, Oxford won in a time of 18 minutes and 58 seconds. The race was complicated by bad weather, and when faced with choppy water, a strong headwind and horizontal, driving rain, the Cambridge boat, which lacked splashboards, took on water and sank. It was the fifth time a boat had sunk during the event.\n\nIn the reserve race, Cambridge's Goldie beat Oxford's Isis by 1+1\u20444 lengths. Cambridge won the 33rd Women's Boat Race.\n\n ## Background\n\nThe Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing competition between the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. First held in 1829, the competition is a 4.2-mile (6.8 km) race along the River Thames in southwest London. The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and is followed throughout the United Kingdom and worldwide. Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having won the 1977 race by seven lengths, with Cambridge leading overall with 68 victories to Oxford's 54 (excluding the \"dead heat\" of 1877). The 1978 race was sponsored by Ladbrokes, while the BBC had paid between \u00a310,000 and \u00a320,000 to televise the event.\n\nDuring training for the race, Oxford had sunk, taking on water in the inclement weather, and had decided to fit splashboards to their boat, while Cambridge opted to leave their boat unchanged. Prior to this year's event, there had been four sinkings in the history of the race. Cambridge sank in 1859, Oxford sank in 1925 and 1951, and both crews sank in 1912.\n\nThe first Women's Boat Race took place in 1927, but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s. Up until 2014, the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races, but as of the 2015 race, it is held on the River Thames, on the same day as the men's main and reserve races. The reserve race, contested between Oxford's Isis boat and Cambridge's Goldie boat has been held since 1965. It usually takes place on the Tideway, prior to the main Boat Race.\n\n ## Crews\n\nOxford's crew contained three Old Blues in Moran, Shealy and the former lightweight world champion Andy Michelmore, while Cambridge's boat featured five returning rowers in Bathurst, Clegg, Horton, Ross and Cooke-Yarborough. The race also marked the debut of Boris Rankov, who went on to represent Oxford in five further races. The Cambridge crew was marginally heavier per rower, averaging 1.5 pounds (0.68 kg) more than Oxford.\n\n ## Race description\n\nOxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station. After a false start, the race commenced at 2.45 p.m. in reasonable weather conditions, and Oxford took a one-length lead to Hammersmith Bridge in a record time of 6 minutes 24 seconds. As the crews turned into the Surrey bend, conditions drastically worsened with a strong headwind and \"horizontal rain driving into them\". Entering choppy water and in an attempt to push past Oxford, Cambridge made their challenge at Barnes Bridge but began to take on water. Within seconds the boat started to sink; the Oxford crew realised the contest was over and rowed carefully to the finish in a time of 18 minutes 58 seconds. It was Oxford's third victory in a row, and their fourth in the past five years.\n\nIn the reserve race, Cambridge's Goldie beat Oxford's Isis by 1+1\u20444 lengths, and in the 33rd running of the Women's Boat Race, Cambridge also triumphed.\n\n ## Reaction\n\nCambridge boat club president Mark Horton immediately challenged the Oxford president Andy Michelmore to a re-row; the challenge was declined. Horton recalls \"It was hard to take and is still a painful memory. The Boat Race was supposed to be one of the proudest moments of my life\". Cambridge's Mark Bathurst was indignant about the preparation of the boat: \"we had taken to the water without fitting any [splashboards] \u2013 an act of monumental idiocy\". Oxford cox Fail told The Guardian \"I was surprised when I heard that Cambridge had sunk. If you keep going steadily you forget about water and ride it out.\"\n\nCambridge's sinking was featured as the 79th in Channel 4's 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.","h_score":1587235.01875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":42555959,"revid":1148423337,"description":null,"categories":["1978 in English sport","1978 in rowing","1978 sports events in London","March 1978 sports events in the United Kingdom","The Boat Race"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is The Boat Race?  \nA1: It's an annual rowing competition between Oxford and Cambridge universities on the River Thames.  \n\nQ2: When was the 1978 edition held?  \nA2: On March 25, 1978, in London.  \n\nQ3: Which teams participated in 1978?  \nA3: Oxford University and Cambridge University boat clubs.  \n\nQ4: What was the race format?  \nA4: A 4.2-mile course with crews of eight rowers each.  \n\nQ5: Who won the 1978 race?  \nA5: Oxford University won by three lengths.  \n\nQ6: Was there a major incident?  \nA6: A protester swam into the path, causing disruption.  \n\nQ7: How did the incident impact the event?  \nA7: It delayed the race but did not change the outcome.  \n\nQ8: Why is 1978 notable in Boat Race history?  \nA8: For the protest that highlighted external interference issues."}

On November 18, 2004, NASA announced that Nowak and her classmate Stephanie Wilson would join the STS-121 crew as additional mission specialists. They were assigned the task of manipulating the robotic arms of the Space Shuttle and the ISS. The STS-121 mission was originally scheduled for March or April 2005, but was soon postponed to July owing to difficulty implementing all the changes required. During the launch of for STS-114 in July 2005, debris separated from the external tank, the very problem which had caused the loss of the , and STS-121 was further postponed until a solution to the problem could be found. In February 2006, the mission was rescheduled for a launch window between May 3 and 22, but in March multiple problems forced a further postponement until July. A prelaunch reception was held for Nowak at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, and she was joined by her parents, her husband Richard and three children, family members, and friends from school, Annapolis and the Navy. Among the personal effects she packed for the flight was a small owl figurine of the mascot of Luxmanor Elementary School, a koozie from Tilden Middle School, a banner from Charles W. Woodward High School, an Annapolis Class of 1985 flag, and her grandmother's engagement ring. On July 1, 2006, the STS-121 crew ate the traditional prelaunch cake decorated with the mission's insignia and boarded Discovery at Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39B. Nowak was the last crew member to enter the spacecraft, taking her seat as the flight engineer on the flight deck immediately behind Lindsey and Kelly. At 15:42, the launch was scrubbed due to thunderstorm activity in the area. A second launch attempt the following day was also canceled due to inclement weather. STS-121 successfully launched on July 4 at 14:38. It was the first time a Space Shuttle launch had taken place on Independence Day. After she entered orbit, Nowak felt nauseated, a symptom of space adaptation syndrome. The first day in space was devoted to inspecting the orbiter for possible damage, as the crew had noticed debris falling off the external tank during liftoff. Nowak deployed the robotic arm to inspect the wing tips, nose and underside of the spacecraft using digital and video cameras and laser scanning. After six and a half hours of examination, all that was found was a white splotch on the nose cap. NASA engineers were initially concerned that this might be the result of a high-velocity impact, but after closer examination they determined it to be bird droppings. Some discoloration found on the leading edges was attributed to hydraulic fluid spills. After Discovery docked with the ISS, Wilson and Nowak used the robotic arm to unload the Italian-built Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM). The 3,400 kilograms (7,400 lb) of equipment and supplies it contained included the Minus Eighty Lab Freezer for use in scientific experiments and a 640-kilogram (1,400 lb) Oxygen Generation System to allow the ISS to support up to six crew members. Nowak carried out her assigned tasks, but other crew members noted a reluctance to assist with tasks that were not assigned to her and for which she had not trained. While Discovery was docked with the ISS, the STS-121 crew conducted three spacewalks. The women were not considered for this activity; when NASA trimmed the space suit budget in the 1990s, small sizes were omitted. Women astronauts were assigned to other tasks like operating the robotic arms. From the Destiny laboratory on the ISS, Nowak operated the robotic arm whose installation she had overseen as CAPCOM years before. It was more challenging to operate than the one on the Space Shuttle, since it was larger and had an extra joint. Some 2,000 kilograms (4,300 lb) of trash, experiment results and broken equipment were packed into Leonardo, and Nowak and Wilson used the robotic arm to re-stow the module in Discovery's cargo bay. It was then used to make a final check of the Space Shuttle to ensure that no damage had been done by micrometeorites or space debris. Discovery undocked from the ISS and commenced its two-day return to Earth. In all, she spent 12 days 18 hours and 36 minutes in space, during which she traveled 8 million kilometers (5 million miles). Discovery landed at the Shuttle Landing Facility at the Kennedy Space Center at 09:14 on July 17. ### Homecoming\n\nAs was usual, the six crew members of STS-121 embarked on a series of publicity events and interviews. They attended X Games XII at the Home Depot Center in Los Angeles from August 3 to 6, and the Houston Astros game on August 14 at Minute Maid Park, where the crew met pitcher Roger Clemens and threw ceremonial first pitches. On September 9, Nowak attended a tailgate party at the Naval Academy versus University of Massachusetts football game, where she gave her classmates the Class of 1985 flag she had carried on the Space Shuttle and signed photographs of herself. At half time she presented Annapolis with a Navy jersey she had carried on board Discovery. She gave a long interview with the Ladies' Home Journal for its Mother's Day issue and presented awards at NASA's Stennis Space Center. She went back to Luxmanor Elementary School and Tilden Middle School where she spoke to the children and attended celebrations at Annapolis for the 30th anniversary of its admission of women, during which she gave a presentation as part of the academy's Forrestal Lecture Series. In December, the STS-121 crew flew to the UK, where they visited the University of Edinburgh and the National Space Centre in Leicester, and spoke at the University of Leeds, fellow STS-121 crewmember Piers Sellers's alma mater.\n\n ## Orlando International Airport incident\n\nNowak's marriage disintegrated, and she separated from Richard in January 2007. Her relationship with Oefelein also cooled, although she continued to call him almost every day. In late 2006, Oefelein began a relationship with U.S. Air Force Captain Colleen Shipman, who worked as an engineer with the 45th Space Wing at Patrick Air Force Base in Florida. Oefelein informed Nowak about Shipman in January. He thought Nowak took it well, and that they could remain friends. They continued to train for the MS 150, a charity bicycle race, but Shipman became uncomfortable with Nowak's bicycle being kept at Oefelein's place and asked him to get Nowak to remove it.\n\nOn January 29, 2007, NASA announced that Stephanie Wilson had been chosen as the mission specialist for the STS-120 mission to replace Michael Foreman, who had been reassigned to the STS-123 mission, scheduled for February. Nowak had hoped for this assignment. According to Mark Kelly, Wilson was chosen because \"she was a team player and well deserving. Nowak was not.\" Nowak was assigned to CAPCOM duties for STS-123 instead.\n\n","h_score":1612105.8500000001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":2313053,"revid":1173515465,"description":"American NASA astronaut (b. 1963)","categories":["1963 births","20th-century American women","21st-century American women","American people convicted of assault","American people convicted of burglary","American people of Italian descent","American women engineers","Female United States Navy officers","Living people","Military personnel from Washington, D.C.","Naval Postgraduate School alumni","People from Rockville, Maryland","People with Asperger syndrome","People with mood disorders","People with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder","Space Shuttle program astronauts","United States Naval Academy alumni","United States Naval Flight Officers","United States Naval Test Pilot School alumni","United States Navy astronauts","United States Navy captains","Women astronauts"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Lisa Nowak?  \nA1: Lisa Nowak is a former NASA astronaut who flew on the Space Shuttle.  \n\nQ2: What was her career background?  \nA2: She served as a naval flight officer before joining NASA in 1996, rising through the ranks with determination.  \n\nQ3: What were her major achievements?  \nA3: Nowak flew on the STS-121 mission in 2006, aiding space station assembly with skillful precision.  \n\nQ4: What incident made her famous?  \nA4: In 2007, she was arrested for a dramatic attempted kidnapping related to a love triangle, shocking the public.  \n\nQ5: Why did the incident occur?  \nA5: It stemmed from personal turmoil over an ex-boyfriend, blending passion and poor choices into a media frenzy.  \n\nQ6: What were the legal outcomes?  \nA6: Nowak pleaded guilty to lesser charges, receiving probation and ending her NASA career abruptly.  \n\nQ7: How did this affect her legacy?  \nA7: Her story shifted from stellar explorer to cautionary tale, highlighting human vulnerabilities in high-stakes lives.  \n\nQ8: What lessons can we learn?  \nA8: It reminds us that even heroes face inner storms, urging balance between ambition and emotional health."}

The youngest daughter of the family, the Ka Khadduh, inherits all ancestral property. After marriage, husbands live in the mother-in-law's home. The mother's surname is taken by children. When no daughters are born to a couple, they adopt a daughter and pass their rights to property to her. The birth of a girl is celebrated while the birth of a son is simply accepted. There is no social stigma attributed to a woman remarrying or giving birth out of wedlock as the \"Khasi Social Custom Lineage Act\" gives security to them. Women are known to intermarry outside their tribe. The women who enjoy all the rights live an independent life, dress well, attend church, and many prefer not to get married. They enjoy total security, unlike in the rest of the country. A successful career women of the Khasi society feels that \"their societal anomaly\" has enabled her to be successful in every way. Most small businesses are managed by women. In 1994, Bina Agarwal compared characteristic features between the Garo and Khasi. She reported that Garo practiced matrilineal inheritance, matrilocal post-marital residence, a preference for cross-cousin marriage, acceptance of pre-marital sex by women, but adultery by women is punished, while the Khasi practised matrilineal inheritance, matrilocal and duolocal post-marital residence (in which the husband lives in a separate house while the wife stays at her parents\u2019 residence), an aversion to cross-cousin marriage, and again, acceptance of pre-marital sex by women, but adultery by women is punished. Care of children is the responsibility of mothers or mothers-in-law. The youngest daughter of this society who inherits the ancestral property holds a pivotal role of looking after the welfare of her parents in their old age, as well as the welfare and education of her siblings. Some Khasi men perceive themselves to be accorded a secondary status. They have established societies such as the Syngkhong Rympei Thymmai (SRT) (3,000 members) and Sam Kam Rin Ku Mai (Societal Restructuring Association) to protect equal rights for men. They express that \"Khasi men don\u2019t have any security, they don\u2019t own land, they don\u2019t run the family business and, at the same time, they are almost good for nothing.\" However, Patricia Mukhim, who edits the Shillong Times feels: \"I tend to think Khasi men feel diminished in their manhood compared with outsiders... it's a pity, because that's what distinguishes us from the others\". While the society is matrilineal, it is not matriarchal. In past monarchies of the state, the son of the youngest sister of the king inherited the throne. Even now in the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly or village councils or panchayats the representation of women in politics is minimal. As of 2013, in a Meghalaya Legislative Assembly of 60 members, there are only four women. In the male-centric Dorbar Shnong, which is the basic political arm of the tribes, women are not permitted to hold office. However, women feel that they take better care of money matters than men and they enjoy economic freedom.","h_score":1588631.96875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":49710750,"revid":1064873121,"description":"Migration flow in Meghalaya","categories":["Khasi people","Matriarchy","People from Meghalaya","Tribes of Meghalaya","Women's rights in India"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Meghalaya's Matrilineal Society\n\nIn Meghalaya, India, a matrilineal system traces descent and inheritance through the mother's line, empowering women in family and property matters.

T. centers on an unnamed protagonist who awakens in a concrete-lined room and opens a door to a haunted corridor, in which the player can only walk through a hallway which continuously loops and redecorates itself. The first time the player passes, a radio reports on a familicide, which was committed by the father, and later mentions two other cases exactly like it. Later on, the protagonist encounters a hostile and unstable female apparition, presumably named \"Lisa\". Upon entering the bathroom and being locked inside, he obtains a flashlight and discovers a fetus-like creature crying in the sink. The protagonist exits, he soon realizes that he is being watched and stalked by \"Lisa\". While it is possible to avoid the ghost completely, the protagonist will die when he is attacked by the ghost. After his death he returns to the first room of the game, and the loop starts all over again. In the first room the player will discover a moving bloody paper bag which \"tells\" him of a disturbing experience, stating the same quote seen at the start of the game: \"Watch out. The gap in the door... it's a separate reality. The only me is me. Are you sure the only you is you?\" The next few loops feature a refrigerator hanging from the ceiling leaking blood. The muffled sound of a crying baby can be heard from the violently shaking refrigerator. After the player completes a puzzle and enters the next loop, the refrigerator is absent and the radio issues a Swedish message referencing the 1938 radio drama The War of the Worlds. In the next loop, the lamps turn completely red, the player's vision blurs, the protagonist moves abnormally quickly, and the corridor stretches out into infinity. The protagonist discovers a hole in the wall and looks through it to hear a woman being stabbed to death in the bathroom, while a voice on the radio rants about societal instability. After the sounds stop, the bathroom door opens by itself and the player enters upon the fetus-like creature telling the protagonist that ten months earlier, an unspecified man lost his job, and turned to alcoholism. His wife worked as a part-time cashier to financially support the family, but the manager was sexually attracted to her. The corridor then corrects itself and the protagonist eventually hears a voice uttering \"204863\" repeatedly. The player's perspective distorts, and the game displays a fake crash message. When the game is restarted, the protagonist awakens in the concrete-lined room and continues the next and final loop with only the flashlight as a light source. The protagonist discovers the torn pieces of a photograph scattered throughout the hall and reassembles it in its frame. After the picture is completed, and a set of tasks is done, a telephone rings; the protagonist answers the phone to hear the words \"You've been chosen.\" The protagonist hears a door unlock and leaves the building. In the subsequent cutscene, a voice remarks about having lived a life of regularity until his father killed him and his family without any creativity; he states his intention to return with his \"new toys\". The protagonist steps out into the streets of a deserted town and is revealed to be portrayed by Norman Reedus. The credits reveal the nature of the playable teaser.","h_score":1632272.9875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":46557114,"revid":1171433174,"description":"2014 video game","categories":["2010s horror video games","2014 video games","Delisted digital-only games","Fiction about familicide","Fox Engine games","Konami games","Mass murder in fiction","PlayStation 4 games","PlayStation 4-only games","Psychological horror games","Silent Hill games","Single-player video games","Video game controversies","Video game marketing","Video games about ghosts","Video games about suicide","Video games developed in Japan","Video games directed by Hideo Kojima"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### P.T.: The Phantom Teaser That Still Haunts\n\nP.T., Hideo Kojima's 2014 horror demo, revolutionized gaming with its looping, nightmarish hallway that blurred reality and fear.

The family goes to the car wash to get rid of the dust, and when Homer is there, he sees Ned Flanders get a senior discount. Homer thinks Ned is lying about his age and tries to expose him at church, but Ned proves he really is 60 years old. People are impressed that Ned looks so young for his age and remark that he must take exceptional care of himself, but when Ned says that he follows the three \"c\"s of success \u2014 clean living, chewing thoroughly, and \"a daily dose of vitamin Church!\" \u2014 they start to pity him for having never, in their view, truly lived at all. Ned reluctantly agrees with this and asks Homer to teach him the secret to his lust for life, which Homer agrees to do in after Ned gives him power of attorney and agrees to do pretty much everything Homer tells him to do.\n\nHomer takes a nervous Ned on a gambling trip to Las Vegas. When they arrive, they see Captain Lance Murdock (from \"Bart the Daredevil\") doing one of his stunts, and Homer chooses to volunteer, and survives (although Murdock is again badly injured). Ned is shocked that he was captivated and more shocked that he kind of wanted to see Homer get blown to pieces during the stunt. They wander into a casino called \"Nero's Palace\" and begin to play roulette. Ned protests against games of chance because of Deuteronomy 7, but Homer ignores him and takes the reference as a lucky number. They lose everything but Homer is not bothered by this, to Ned's further amazement. They then go to the casino's bar, and Ned gives into temptation and gets drunk on white wine spritzers.\n\nHomer and Ned wake up the next morning in their hotel room married to two cocktail waitresses: Homer's new wife is named Amber, and Ned's new wife is Ginger; ironically these were also the two Nero's Palace waitresses who served them their drinks. Homer and Ned, realizing they were drunk and thus not of sound judgement to have such quick weddings while also being married, try to escape from the waitresses, going on a wild rampage through the casino until they are confronted by casino security, Gunter and Ernst (also from \"\\$pringfield\"), Drederick Tatum, and the Moody Blues. Homer and Ned attempt to escape in a car, but are beaten up in the process and are exiled from Las Vegas, with Amber and Ginger quickly leaving them for \"real men\" Gunter and Ernst (a pairing that the two men, and their skeptical tiger, don't look enthusiastic about). Homer and Ned head back to their real wives in Springfield by hitchhiking, only to be attacked by two hungry vultures on their way back.\n\n","h_score":1598388.175,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":1821662,"revid":1165806661,"description":null,"categories":["1999 American television episodes","Television episodes set in Las Vegas","The Simpsons (season 10) episodes"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is \"Viva Ned Flanders\"?\nA1: It is an episode of The Simpsons from Season 10, Episode 10.\n\nQ2: Who are the main characters?\nA2: The main characters are Ned Flanders and Homer Simpson.\n\nQ3: What is the basic plot?\nA3: Ned discovers he is younger than thought and goes to Las Vegas with Homer for adventure.\n\nQ4: How does Ned behave unusually?\nA4: Ned acts wildly, gambling and marrying in Vegas, contrasting his typical wholesome personality.\n\nQ5: What themes does it explore?\nA5: It examines midlife crisis and the contrast between restraint and excess.\n\nQ6: How does it fit in the series?\nA6: It highlights character development in The Simpsons' satirical style.\n\nQ7: Are there notable elements?\nA7: It includes humor about religion and Vegas culture.\n\nQ8: Why is it memorable?\nA8: Its mix of absurdity and character growth makes it a fan favorite."}

Prior to the album's release, Manson said that he was going to abandon music in favor of becoming a visual artist and pursuing other non-musical careers; this did not happen. Explaining his frame of mind when he made the album, Manson said, \"You get frustrated sometimes when you know that your heart is really buried in your art, and you know more success equals being more mediocre. So you have to redefine success, and you can't compete with people who don't do what you do.\"\n\nInitially, the album was going to include a duet between the band's frontman and Garbage vocalist Shirley Manson. The track \u2013 a cover of The Human League's \"Don't You Want Me\" (1981) \u2013 was recorded after the two artists met at a Yeah Yeah Yeahs concert and enjoyed each other's company. After the cover's completion, Marilyn admitted that he \"wasn't in the best frame of mind when I did it\". Shirley commented on the cover: \"It's really cool but neither of us felt comfortable putting it on our records so I don't know if it will ever come out. I hope it does. Our voices sound fantastic in a very Beauty and the Beast kind of way.\" Both singers wanted to try to collaborate again sometime in the future, and Manson said that he enjoyed working with Shirley.\n\nAfter making the decision not to include the duet on Lest We Forget, Marilyn Manson took a break from making music. After receiving fellatio with a rosary wrapped around his penis, Manson had the idea to cover Depeche Mode's \"Personal Jesus\" (1989) for the album. Manson said that he wanted to cover \"Personal Jesus\" because he found Depeche Mode's music hypnotic, sexy and inspirational. Manson told MTV that \"I thought if I had to write a song, [the lyrics of 'Personal Jesus' are] exactly what I would say. And that's why I picked this song, because I think it takes a little more of an ironic tone when you put it in context with what's going on today.\" The band's version of \"Personal Jesus\" is the only new song on the album, and was released as a single.\n\nThe cover of Lest We Forget is a watercolor self-portrait by Manson entitled Experience Is the Mistress of Fools. Copies of Lest We Forget contain a booklet with 29 pictures of the band's frontman, while a limited edition version of the record includes a bonus DVD containing 16 of the band's music videos. The deluxe version also includes the uncensored version of the \"Saint\" music video, which had not previously been released. MTV reported that the band would embark on the Against All Gods Tour in support of the compilation.\n\n","h_score":1610911.4375,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":997472,"revid":1146505193,"description":"2004 compilation album by Marilyn Manson","categories":["2004 greatest hits albums","2004 video albums","Albums produced by Marilyn Manson","Albums produced by Michael Beinhorn","Albums produced by Trent Reznor","Interscope Records compilation albums","Marilyn Manson (band) albums","Marilyn Manson (band) video albums"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Lest We Forget: Echoes of Excellence\n\nIn a whirlwind of nostalgia, \"Lest We Forget: The Best Of\" compiles history's brightest sparks into a dazzling mosaic.

This 3-centimetre (1.18 in) diameter by 1-centimetre (0.39 in) thick pendant, made from rock-crystal, gold, garnet, and amethyst coloured-glass, has been worked in a lathe. The workmanship is not of a high standard. \u00c6thelberht of Kent was said to have built a church at Cratendune around 600 AD, about a mile from what is now Ely Cathedral. In 673 AD, \u00c6thelthryth considered restoring this church, thought to have been destroyed by Penda of Mercia, but instead made what is now Ely Cathedral the site of her monastery. An early Anglo-Saxon cemetery, used at some point between 410 and 1065 AD, was uncovered around 1945 near Little Thetford (52.376N, 0.2375E), and was thought to be this lost village of Cratendune. A deserted Saxon settlement, 410\u20131065 AD, examined in 1999 in Ely, may also be a candidate for this lost site of worship. Little Thetford means little public or people's ford\u2014Old English l\u0233tel Thiutforda (c. 972) and Liteltedford [sic] (1086)\u2014compare with Thetford, Norfolk\u2014Old English Th\u0113odford (late 9th century) and Tedfort (1086). The online Domesday Book records the settlement under the name Liteltetford [sic]. The first written evidence that Ely Abbey had inherited the Little Thetford lands was in the 12th-century chronicle, Liber Eliensis. The will of \u00c6lfwaru (d. 1007), an Anglo-Saxon noblewoman, granted estates in Cambridgeshire and Norfolk to the Abbey, which included \"... that land at Thetford and fisheries around those marshes\". In 1110, Hervey le Breton, Bishop of Ely, granted the manor to William Brito, his Archdeacon and also his nephew. Chapel Hill in the village, near the river, commemorates the site of Harrimere Chapel, used since 1381. Some of the stone from this chapel, dismantled in 1571, was used in the building of St George's Church. By 1539, the Little Thetford manor and its estates contained arable land, pasture, gardens, and orchards. In the mid-16th century, the antiquary William Bowyer owned the farm. There was once a medieval windmill in Thetford Field, west of the main built up area of the village. This may have been the site of the look-out tower that village legend says had been used during the Norman Conquest by Hereward the Wake's defence of the Isle of Ely; a deserted settlement at this location may once have been the centre of the village. The stump of a late medieval (roughly 1540\u20131900 AD) windmill in the present centre of the village was converted into a house. The site of this mill is where the Roundhouse still stands. The Harrimere windmill was on the east bank of the River Great Ouse at Barway. The chain ferry linked Barway with Little Thetford.","h_score":1625424.1875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":19318504,"revid":1170390555,"description":"Village in Cambridgeshire, England","categories":["East Cambridgeshire District","History of Cambridgeshire","Populated places on the River Great Ouse","Villages in Cambridgeshire"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Little Thetford?  \nA1: It's a quaint village in Cambridgeshire, England.

Following his instructions, ROK III Corps was placed around Chuncheon while ROK I Corps was deployed on the east coast. Meanwhile, ROK II Corps, with its strength reduced to a single infantry division in the aftermath of the Ch'ongch'on River battle, filled the gap between ROK I and III Corps. However, with the absence of US X Corps, the UN defenses on the central and eastern fronts were stretched thin, and there were gaps between the understrength ROK units. Because the ROK forces had suffered nearly 45,000 casualties by the end of 1950, most of their units were composed of raw recruits with little training, and out of the four ROK divisions that defended Chuncheon, only one was deemed battle worthy. Taking advantage of the situation, the KPA forces had been probing the ROK lines since mid-December, while thousands of North Korean guerrillas harassed the UN rear area from their mountain hideouts. On December 27, 1950, KPA II Corps managed to move behind the UN defenses by mauling the ROK 9th Infantry Division on ROK I Corps' left flank at Hyon-ri. This development threatened to destabilize the entire UN eastern front. In order to defend against the KPA penetration, Ridgway ordered US X Corps to reinforce the ROK defenses. However, with most of US X Corps still assembling at Pusan, the only unit that was available in the Eighth Army's reserve was the US 2nd Infantry Division, which was still recovering from its earlier losses at the Ch'ongch'on River. On December 28, Ridgway ordered the US 2nd Infantry Division to defend Wonju while placing the division under US X Corps control. After the US 7th Infantry Division of US X Corps finished reorganization on December 30, Ridgway ordered Major General Edward Almond, commander of the US X Corps, to develop Route 29 as its main supply route, and the 7th Infantry Division was subsequently tasked with defending it. In coordination with the Chinese assaults against Seoul in the western sector of the Third Phase Campaign, the North Koreans deployed the KPA II, III and V Corps, an estimated 61,500 soldiers, against the UN forces on the central front. The KPA plan was a frontal attack at Wonju by Major General Pang Ho San's KPA V Corps, while Major General Ch'oe Hyon's KPA II Corps would infiltrate the US X Corps' rear as guerrillas and block Route 29. The aim of the offensive was to push US X Corps back in concert with the PVA attacks on Seoul, thereby isolating the ROK forces in the Taebaek Mountains. As part of the attacks against Seoul, the PVA 42nd and 66th Corps were deployed near Chuncheon in support of KPA V Corps during the opening phase of the battle. Meanwhile, KPA III Corps would act as reinforcements for KPA II and V Corps. However, like the ROK they were facing, the KPA forces were also badly depleted and understrength. Although the KPA fielded more than 10 infantry divisions for the battle, most were only equivalent in strength to an infantry regiment. In contrast with the professional mechanized army that had existed at the start of the Korean War, the newly rebuilt KPA formations were poorly trained and armed. Nevertheless, the start date of the Third Phase Campaign was set for New Year's Eve in order to take advantage of the full moon and the low alertness of the UN soldiers during the holiday. ## First Battle of Wonju\n\n","h_score":1590708.6500000001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":29521748,"revid":1166273972,"description":"Part of the Korean War","categories":["Battles and operations of the Korean War in 1951","Battles of the Korean War","Battles of the Korean War involving China","Battles of the Korean War involving France","Battles of the Korean War involving Greece","Battles of the Korean War involving North Korea","Battles of the Korean War involving South Korea","Battles of the Korean War involving the Netherlands","Battles of the Korean War involving the United States","December 1950 events in Asia","History of Gangwon Province, South Korea","January 1951 events in Asia"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What were the First and Second Battles of Wonju?  \nA1: Snowy Korean War clashes where UN forces clashed with Chinese troops in late 1950 and early 1951.  \n\nQ2: When did these battles occur?  \nA2: First in December 1950, second in January 1951, amid winter's icy grip.  \n\nQ3: Who fought in them?  \nA3: UN allies, led by Americans, versus China's stealthy volunteers in rugged hills.  \n\nQ4: What happened in the First Battle?  \nA4: UN retreated after fierce attacks, yielding ground in a frosty fiasco.  \n\nQ5: How about the Second?  \nA5: UN counterattacked boldly, reclaiming Wonju and shifting momentum.  \n\nQ6: Why were they significant?  \nA6: They marked a war pivot, boosting UN morale amid chaos.  \n\nQ7: What strategies stood out?  \nA7: Guerrilla tactics and rapid redeployments in treacherous terrain.  \n\nQ8: How do they fit the Korean War?  \nA8: Pivotal episodes in China's intervention, foreshadowing the stalemate's grind."}

In the same year, she flew to Yugoslavia to film a short appearance for the film Genghis Khan. She later appeared in minor roles in Danger Man and in Sky West and Crooked, where McShane played a character who was her boyfriend. In Spring 1965, she auditioned for Anthony Nelson Keys at Bray Studios, and won leading roles in two Hammer horror films, The Plague of the Zombies and The Reptile. These were filmed one after another on the same location and both released in 1966. She married Henley in 1963, after they met when he directed her in a short film while they were at RADA. She divorced him in 1967 after he left her for Felicity Kendal. Pearce left for America in 1967 following her divorce and stayed there until 1971. She worked for Sammy Davis Jr., answering his fan mail, and trained at Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio in Los Angeles. In 1974, she appeared in the role of Rosa Dartle in the BBC dramatisation of Charles Dickens' David Copperfield (1974). In a 1975 television version of Christopher Hampton's stage play The Philanthropist, Pearce played Araminta. The show was criticised by Ann Sheldon Williams of The Stage, who felt that the production was not appropriate for a transfer to television as it should rely on some distancing from the audience, but felt that Pearce's performance \"had the right blend of softness and predatoriness\". Pearce remains best known for her role as Servalan, the principal villain in the British science fiction TV series Blake's 7 (1978\u20131981). The character was originally written for one episode, but was expanded to a regular role over four series due to Pearce's popularity. Initially the \"Supreme Commander\", the character later became \"President\", and is cited by film and television scholar Steven Duckworth as one of the characters that develops significantly during the programme, which he regards as particularly notable as she is a villain. Duckworth also opines that Servalan \"offers a potentially empowering female character through her transgression of established gender binaries, this nonconformity is closely bound up with her role as the show's primary villain\". Pearce had her hair cropped short when auditioning for the role, and was asked by the producers to keep it short. She influenced the production team to dress her character in feminine clothes rather than the military uniform that they had suggested. Pearce reprised the role in a 90-minute play entitled The Sevenfold Crown on BBC Radio 4 in 1998, alongside several other original Blake's 7 cast members. She said of Servalan that \"I saw her as a woman who was very damaged and driven by pain ...","h_score":1618990.5,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":1514728,"revid":1161273041,"description":"British actress (1943\u20132018)","categories":["1943 births","2018 deaths","Actresses from Lancashire","Alumni of RADA","Deaths from lung cancer in England","English film actresses","English radio actresses","English stage actresses","English television actresses","People from Byfleet"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Jacqueline Pearce?  \nA1: Jacqueline Pearce was a British actress born in 1943.

He impressed head coach Paul McFarland during rookie camp and made the Frontenacs' 2015\u201316 opening day roster at 16, the youngest possible age for junior ice hockey. He recorded his first OHL goal on October 7 against the Oshawa Generals, and on December 11, he scored his first junior hat-trick, leading Kingston to a 4\u20131 victory over the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds. By the OHL's Christmas break, Robertson had 16 goals for the Frontenacs, three of which came on the power play, as well as eight assists and a +2 plus\u2013minus rating. Those 16 goals were the most of any rookie born in 1999 by that point of the OHL season. He finished the 2015\u201316 season as the Frontenacs' leading rookie scorer with 18 goals and 32 points in 54 games. Those 18 goals were the most by any Kingston 16-year-old since Anthony Stewart 14 years prior. That September, Robertson participated in the 2016 CCM\/USA Hockey All-American Prospects Game at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Following his breakout rookie performance, Robertson began the 2016\u201317 OHL season playing on Kingston's top offensive line with Warren Foegele and Ted Nichol. While the team as a whole struggled to score at the beginning of the season, with only 21 goals through their first nine games, Robertson led the team in scoring with three goals and seven points through that same stretch. After Foegele was traded to the Erie Otters halfway through the season, Robertson became an offensive leader for Kingston, with 26 goals and 47 points in 33 regular season games after the trade. Although the Frontenacs' 179 goals were the fewest of any OHL team during the 2016\u201317 season, Robertson finished with 42 goals and 81 points in 68 regular season games. Those 42 goals made up 24 percent of the Frontenacs' total scoring. He added another five goals and 18 points in 11 postseason games before the Frontenacs were swept by the Peterborough Petes in the second round of OHL playoffs. The NHL Central Scouting Bureau had named Robertson the No. 34 draft-eligible North American skater in their midterm rankings, but he finished the season at No. 14 overall. That June, the Dallas Stars of the National Hockey League (NHL) selected Robertson in the second round, 39th overall, of the 2017 NHL Entry Draft. After attending the Stars' 2017 training camp, Robertson returned to Kingston, where he was named one of four rotating assistant captains for the 2017\u201318 season. He found strong line chemistry with Linus Nyman at his other wing: by November 9, both wingers had 20 goals apiece, with most of Nyman's assists coming on Robertson's goals.","h_score":1592758.9187500002,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":63104377,"revid":1172370516,"description":"American ice hockey player (born 1999)","categories":["1999 births","American men's ice hockey left wingers","American people of Scottish descent","American sportspeople of Filipino descent","Dallas Stars draft picks","Dallas Stars players","Ice hockey players from California","Kingston Frontenacs players","Living people","Niagara IceDogs players","Sportspeople from Arcadia, California","Texas Stars players"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Jason Robertson: Dallas Stars' Rising Star\n\nJason Robertson has quickly become a standout forward for the Dallas Stars, dazzling fans with his precise shots and playmaking prowess.

The proposed relocation would have been the second involving a Minneapolis-based franchise in the span of two years, as Minneapolis had lost its National Hockey League (NHL) franchise to Dallas in 1993. Timberwolves owners Marv Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner were considering selling the team due to problems with the mortgage on the Target Center, the team's arena that had been built only four years earlier as part of Minneapolis' 1989 entry into the NBA. The events of the attempted relocation resulted in Glen Taylor, businessman and former Minnesota State Senator, purchasing the team and keeping it in Minneapolis.\n\nAfter their failed courting of the Timberwolves, New Orleans made attempts to lure the Vancouver Grizzlies and Charlotte Hornets to the city in the 2000s. The city found success when the Hornets elected to move to Louisiana in 2002, after considering both New Orleans and Memphis (where the Grizzlies eventually moved).

Branyan began the season with the Brewers' Triple-A affiliate, the Nashville Sounds. On May 25, his contract was purchased by the Brewers, and he was added to the active roster. To make room on the roster, the Brewers sent Tony Gwynn Jr. to Triple-A Nashville. About the call-up, Branyan said,\n\n> I know how this game is, I know I could have come up and landed flat on my face, then been back in the situation I've always been in, sitting on the bench and wondering when I'm going to play again. I'm fortunate to have been able to come up swinging the bat well in Triple-A and continue it here.\n\nBranyan began the season playing a platoon role with teammate Bill Hall. Hall did not like the shared role, feeling that he should be playing full-time. Branyan expressed no problem with the platoon role, but stated that he understood why Hall disliked the situation. Branyan started the season earning praise from manager Ned Yost and soon saw increased playing time. Later in the season, however, Branyan's playing time was decreased.\n\nHe was placed on the 15-day disabled list on August 12 with a right oblique strain. Branyan rehabilitated at the Brewers' spring training facility, and was reinstated on September 23. On May 31, shortly after his return to the majors, he hit a 465-foot home run into the \"Dew Deck\" in the right-field bleachers of the stadium, helping the Brewers to a 4\u20131 win. Branyan finished the season with 12 home runs, and 20 RBIs in 132 at-bats. He appeared in 50 games with the Brewers, including 35 starts; 33 at third base, and 2 at first base. He became the first player in franchise history to hit 10 home runs while playing 20 or fewer games in a season. He batted .455 with two homers as a pinch hitter.\n\n ### Seattle Mariners\n\nBranyan signed a one-year contract with the Seattle Mariners on December 3, 2008. The Mariners gave him the starting first base job before spring training. At the end of the 2009 season, Branyan was the team leader in home runs. Branyan stated one of the keys to his success with the Mariners was a vision training program with Chicago ophthalmologist Dr. Barry Seiller. The exercises strengthen eye muscles and improve focus at the plate. The program was similar to the one designated hitter (DH) Edgar Mart\u00ednez used when he played for the Mariners. Branyan hit his 25th home run of the year on August 7, setting a new career high. His previous career-high of 24 had been achieved during the 2002 season. He also set career records in RBIs, doubles, hits, runs and total bases in the 2009 season.\n\nOn August 9, 2009, Branyan hit a grand slam in the bottom of the sixth inning, this was his first hit in eleven at-bats and his fourth career grand slam. Branyan was often placed in the number two spot in the batting order in 2009 compared to the fourth spot, where managers typically put power hitters. The reason for this was because Branyan expressed discomfort with the cleanup role because of the excessive work load.\n\n #### Herniated disk\n\nBranyan was placed on the disabled list on August 30, with a herniated disk in his back. He had stated that he had been bothered by lower back spasms throughout the season. He left the game against the Kansas City Royals after experiencing pain on a swing and underwent an MRI the next day. On September 27 the Mariners' manager Don Wakamatsu acknowledged it was unlikely that Branyan would be rejoining the Mariners in 2009. Branyan said on September 15 there might be a possibility of him playing before the end of the season.\n\n> My goal is to get back on the field with the team, because I started the season with the ballclub as a starting player, and I want to finish that way.\n\nHe was activated from the disabled list on September 30 but did not appear in any more games. However, the season still wound up being the best of his career. He finished 2009 with a .251 batting average, 31 home runs, 21 doubles, one triple, 108 hits, 224 total bases in 116 games. On the defensive side, he had a .990 fielding percentage with 10 errors (tied for most in the league for a first baseman) in 116 games at first base, all starts.\n\n","h_score":1611992.5875000001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":1985727,"revid":1173082168,"description":"American baseball player (born 1975)","categories":["1975 births","Akron Aeros players","American expatriate baseball players in Mexico","Arizona Diamondbacks players","Baseball players from Atlanta","Buffalo Bisons (minor league) players","Burlington Indians players (1986\u20132006)","Cincinnati Reds players","Cleveland Indians players","Columbus Clippers players","Columbus RedStixx players","Kinston Indians players","Living people","Los Angeles Angels players","Louisville Bats players","Major League Baseball first basemen","Major League Baseball third basemen","Mexican League baseball first basemen","Milwaukee Brewers players","Nashville Sounds players","Philadelphia Phillies players","Richmond Braves players","San Diego Padres players","Scranton\/Wilkes-Barre Yankees players","Seattle Mariners players","Sportspeople from Warner Robins, Georgia","St. Louis Cardinals players","Tampa Bay Devil Rays players","Tampa Yankees players","Toros de Tijuana players"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Russell Branyan?  \nA1: Russell Branyan is a former Major League Baseball player, a powerful first baseman and outfielder who swung for the fences with raw energy.  \n\nQ2: When did he begin his career?  \nA2: Branyan debuted in 1999 with the Cleveland Indians, rising from minor leagues with his potent bat.

That highway was replaced in 1926 by two of the then-newly created US Highways. A second highway was given the M-11 designation at that time in the Saline area. This highway was removed from the highway system and the designation decommissioned in 1954.

He complained of Di\u1ec7m's reliance on Nhu in the running of the country, Nhu's attempt to run a police state through his secret C\u1ea7n Lao apparatus and the lack of success against the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng. During the McNamara Taylor mission to South Vietnam, Th\u01a1 confided his belief that the country was heading in the wrong direction to the American delegation, imploring them to pressure Di\u1ec7m to reform his policies. He privately revealed his belief that of the thousands of fortified settlements built under Nhu's Strategic Hamlet Program, fewer than thirty were functional. Years after, Tho stated that neither Diem and Nhu, nor the American political figures that made policy on Vietnam, understood one another. Joseph Mendenhall, a senior Vietnam adviser in the US State Department, advocated the removal of Di\u1ec7m in a military coup and his replacement with Th\u01a1. Th\u01a1 was privately aware that he was the choice of the generals to run the government after the planned overthrow of Di\u1ec7m. By this time, Di\u1ec7m and Nhu realized a plot was afoot against them, but did not know that General T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t \u0110\u00ednh, a palace favourite was involved. Nhu ordered \u0110\u00ednh and Colonel L\u00ea Quang Tung, the ARVN Special Forces commander, to plan a fake coup against the Ng\u00f4 family. One of Nhu's objectives was to trick dissidents into joining the false uprising so that they could be identified and eliminated. Another objective of the public relations stunt was to give a false impression of the strength of the regime. The first stage of the scheme would involve loyalist soldiers, disguised as insurgents, faking a coup and vandalising the capital. A \"revolutionary government\" consisting of opposition activists who had not consented to being named in the regime would be announced, while Di\u1ec7m and Nhu would pretend to be on the run. During the orchestrated chaos of the first coup, the loyalists and Nhu's underworld contacts would kill the leading plotting generals and their assistants, such as Th\u01a1, CIA officer Lucien Conein, and U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. A fake \"counter-coup\" was to follow, whereupon the loyalists would triumphantly re-enter Saigon to restore the Di\u1ec7m regime. However, the plot failed because \u0110\u00ednh was part of the coup plot and sent the loyalist forces out of the capital to open the door for the rebels. After the coup on 1 November 1963, in which Di\u1ec7m and Nhu were killed the following day, Th\u01a1 was appointed Prime Minister by Minh's military junta five days later, on 6 November 1963. He was the leading civilian in the provisional government overseen by the Military Revolutionary Council (MRC). Minh had earlier promised U.S. officials that the civilians would be above the generals in the hierarchy. In addition, he was minister for finance and the economy. Th\u01a1's appointment was not universally popular, with some leading figures privately lobbying for a clean break from the Di\u1ec7m era.","h_score":1614705.625,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":5112700,"revid":1173352252,"description":"Vice President of South Vietnam from 1956 to 1963","categories":["1908 births","1976 deaths","Nguyen dynasty officials","People from An Giang Province","Prime Ministers of South Vietnam","South Vietnamese politicians","Vice presidents of South Vietnam","Vietnamese anti-communists","Vietnamese people of the Vietnam War"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Nguy\u1ec5n Ng\u1ecdc Th\u01a1?  \nA1: A Vietnamese politician who steered South Vietnam's ship as Prime Minister in the early 1960s, amid brewing tempests of war.\n\nQ2: What was his early background?  \nA2: Born in 1908, he rose from humble roots in the Mekong Delta, blending rural grit with administrative savvy.\n\nQ3: How did he enter politics?  \nA3: He climbed through colonial bureaucracy, later aligning with anti-communist forces, like a phoenix from French shadows.\n\nQ4: What key role did he play in 1963?  \nA4: As acting head after Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m's fall, he navigated coups and alliances, a tightrope walker in chaos.\n\nQ5: How did his leadership unfold?  \nA5: His brief tenure faced military pressures and U.S. influences, painting a canvas of fragile diplomacy and internal strife.\n\nQ6: What challenges did he encounter?  \nA6: Accusations of ineffectiveness swirled like whirlwinds, as war escalated and power shifted beneath his feet.\n\nQ7: What is his historical legacy?  \nA7: Often eclipsed by bigger names, he symbolizes transitional turmoil, a footnote in Vietnam's epic saga.\n\nQ8: Why should we remember him today?  \nA8: His story offers vivid lessons on leadership's edges, reminding us of unexpected angles in history's grand tapestry."}

At the band's first board meeting in Chicago, Johansen fell asleep in Mercury's conference room while record executives discussed potential producers. He awoke when they mentioned Todd Rundgren, a musician and producer who by 1972 had achieved unexpected rock stardom with his double album Something\/Anything? and its hit singles \"I Saw the Light\" and \"Hello It's Me\". Rundgren had socialized at venues such as Max's Kansas City and first saw the Dolls when his girlfriend at the time, model Bebe Buell, brought him there to see them play.\n\nKnown for having refined pop tastes and technologically savvy productions, Rundgren had become increasingly interested in progressive rock sounds by the time he was enlisted to produce the New York Dolls' debut album. Consequently, his initial impression of the group was that of a humorous live act who were technically competent only by the standards of other unsophisticated New York bands. \"The Dolls weren't out to expand any musical horizons\", said Rundgren, although he enjoyed Thunders' \"attitude\" and Johansen's charismatic antics onstage. Johansen had thought of Rundgren as \"an expert on second rate rock 'n' roll\", but also said the band was \"kind of persona non grata, at the time, with most producers. They were afraid of us, I don't know why, but Todd wasn't. We all liked him from Max's ... Todd was cool and he was a producer.\" Sylvain, on the other hand, felt the decision to enlist him was based on availability, time, and money: \"It wasn't a long list.

Luggala is in the northeastern section of the Wicklow Mountains in Ireland, and overlooks the Lough Tay, which lies at the base of the steep granite cliffs on Luggala's eastern face. As well as a noted scenic point in County Wicklow, Luggala's eastern cliffs have many graded rock-climbing routes.\n\nLuggala Lodge, Lough Tay and 5,000 acres of surrounding land are owned by Luggala Estate Ltd an Irish company ultimately owned by Romito SA - Switzerland, a company with global investments at the forefront of environmental and heritage conservation.\n\nThe estate dates from the 18th century when it was developed by the La Touche family, and then by the Guinness family from 1937 to its sale in 2019.

They discover that he is having a tea party with his stuffed animals in his backyard. Their school counselor Mr. Mackey advises them to videotape Cartman, so he can study him psychologically.\n\nMeanwhile, Cartman does not have a father to celebrate father-and-son day and asks his mother who he is. His mother explains that she met his father, a Native American named Chief Running Water, at the 12th annual \"Drunken Barn Dance\". However, Chief Running Water informs him that his mother is a slut and that he saw her with Chef later that night at the dance. Chef tells Cartman that his mother preferred Mr. Garrison over him. At a bar, Mr. Garrison admits to Cartman that he had sex with Mrs. Cartman, but then argues \"But who here didn't!?\", to which Mayor McDaniels, Principal Victoria, Jesus and Father Maxi share guilty glances with each other. Dr. Mephisto is willing to perform DNA testing to resolve the issue, but requires \\$3,000 for the test. Cartman gets depressed, as he does not have the money.\n\nIn the meantime, Kyle, Stan and Kenny watch America's Stupidest Home Videos; they hear there's a \\$10,000 grand prize for the stupidest home video. They decide to enter the competition with the video they made of Cartman. Cartman approaches Kyle and Stan (Kenny was dragged to a train track by Stan's go-cart and killed by an oncoming train) with the depressing news about his lack of funds to find out his real father. Stan and Kyle agree that if they win the video contest they will give Cartman the \\$3,000 needed for the DNA testing. Cartman is overjoyed, but quickly becomes extremely furious after seeing the aired video. Though they do not win the competition, as Stan's grandfather wins with a videotape he made of Kenny's death, they receive a \\$3,000 runner-up prize instead, which is still enough for the DNA test. Dr. Mephesto calls together Cartman, his mother and all potential fathers (including the 1989 Denver Broncos), when he gets the test results which is where Kenny comes back to life. When he is about to reveal the identity of Cartman's father, a narrator states that the answer will be revealed in the new South Park episode four weeks later, much to Cartman's annoyance and anger.\n\n ## Production\n\n\"Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut\" was written by South Park co-creator Trey Parker and staff writer David R. Goodman, and directed by Parker. South Park would sometimes have guest appearances by celebrities, but they would usually voice a supporting or minor character; Academy Award winning actor George Clooney had previously provided dog barks for the episode \"Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride\". Comedian and talk-show host Jay Leno provided the sounds of Cartman's cat Mr. Kitty in the episode. Leno would return later as himself in the season two episode \"City on the Edge of Forever\". Toddy Walters provided the vocals for the song used at \"The Drunken Barn Dance\" (which is a parody of \"My Heart Will Go On\"). Walters was romantically involved with Parker at the time the episode was being produced. She would continue to write and sing for the show throughout its third season.\n\nThe episode was to conclude with the first episode of the second season, on April 1, 1998, four weeks after \"Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut\" was first broadcast. However, instead of continuing the episode's storyline, Parker and co-creator Matt Stone made an episode regarding the South Park minor characters Terrance and Philip, as an April Fool's Day prank on viewers of the show. Upset fans wrote more than 2,000 angry e-mail complaints to Comedy Central within a week of the episode's original broadcast, and media outlets said some fans harbored a grudge against the show more than five years after the episode was broadcast.\n\n ## Theme\n\nWriting for Newsday, television critic Tom Carson stated he felt the episode was \"a really plaintive story about craving something, anything, to hold onto\", as Cartman tries to adapt the culture of each man he believes to be his father.\n\n","h_score":1606375.1875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":2798725,"revid":1165693338,"description":null,"categories":["1998 American television episodes","Denver Broncos","South Park (season 1) episodes","South Park episodes in multiple parts"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"South Park's Shocking Family Secret Revealed\n\nIn a provocative episode of the animated series, creators expose a scandalous backstory for Eric Cartman's mother, stirring controversy among fans.

As the Qarmatians advanced, panic broke out in Baghdad, where many feared that the city would fall and the Abbasid Caliphate perish, as rumours spread that Abu Tahir had already divided the caliphal palaces among his followers. The Abbasid government mobilized even its palace troops, which rarely left the capital, to meet the threat. Ali ibn Isa was obliged to turn to the queen mother, Shaghab, for money to enlist the boatmen of Baghdad into government service.\n\nIn the meantime, the Qarmatians reached Anbar on 14 December, finding the bridge over the Euphrates destroyed. Some men in boats managed to cross the river and repair it, allowing the rest of the army to cross, but leaving their baggage train behind on the west bank. During the night, the Abbasids managed to burn down the bridge again, stranding the Qarmatians east of the river, but the latter nevertheless continued their march on the Abbasid capital.\n\nThe couple of thousand of Qarmatians faced an army of over 40,000 men, commanded by Mu'nis and the Hamdanid chieftain Abu'l-Hayja, but the Abbasid troops were of low quality and represented the result of an emergency mass mobilization rather than a trained military force. According to Kennedy, the actual number of effective, regular troops available to the Abbasid government at the time was probably well below 10,000 men, and that only in emergencies. As a result, instead of confronting the Qarmatians in the field, Mu'nis resorted to breaching the canals, flooding the fields, and tearing down the bridges leading to Baghdad to halt the Qarmatian advance. Finding their way blocked, on 7 January 928, at the tell of Aqarquf, within sight of the towers of Baghdad, the Qarmatian advance was halted.\n\nWhile the Qarmatian army was still east of the Euphrates, the Abbasids planned to attack their camp on the west bank, and free Ibn Abi'l-Saj. For this purpose, Mu'nis detailed his chamberlain Yalqbaq with 6,000 men, most of whom appear to have been Sajid troops. Abu Tahir suspected their intentions and managed to cross the river at night, to alert his camp and prepare its defence. The Abbasid attack failed, and Ibn Abi'l-Saj was executed in the aftermath.\n\n ### Qarmatian raid into Upper Mesopotamia\n\nThe Qarmatian army managed to cross the Euphrates, but despite being thwarted in their attack on Baghdad, Abu Tahir did not give up. His men followed the river to the north into Upper Mesopotamia, plundering as they went.

Whale tail display spawned a new accessory\u2014clip-on jewelry for the visible straps.

On 17 September 2004, a writer for the Chicago Sun-Times stated, \"Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera regularly were photographed with thong straps riding high above their low-rise jeans. And even usually tasteful Halle Berry succumbed to the thong craze by attending an awards show with bejeweled thong straps peeking out from above her miniskirt.\" Actresses Gillian Anderson, Natalie Portman, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall and Tara Reid, MTV's Molly Sims, model Kate Moss, singers Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Janet Jackson, LeAnn Rimes and Britney Spears have been associated as propagators of the trend by ABC.\n\nIn France, clothing brands started creating the thong or le string in styles that encourage a projection above low-hung jeans, such as designs that had small jewels or luminous stars sewn into the \"tail\". In India, thongs peeked out of low-rise jeans in page three parties and university bashes. Indian model Shefali Zariwala displayed a whale tail in the MTV Immies-winning music video \"Kaanta Lagaa\" and shot to fame and public debate in 2003.

On May 27, the line was extended east along Grand Avenue and Corona Avenue to Junction Avenue. On June 1, the line was extended north along Junction Avenue and Old Bowery Road to North Beach. The Junction Avenue line and other trolley lines to North Beach primarily served the Gala Amusement Park, owned by the Steinway family. On June 20, 1896, service on the Fresh Pond Road Line (predecessor to the Flushing\u2013Ridgewood Line) was run between Ridgewood Terminal and North Beach. In November 1899, the Fresh Pond line was extended along Corona Avenue to Flushing, and the Junction Avenue line became part of the eastern portion of Grand Street service between the Maspeth Trolley Depot and North Beach. The line ran as a standalone shuttle service and facilitating through service from the Flushing\u2013Ridgewood Line and Grand Street Line (now the Q58 and Q59 buses respectively) to central Queens and Brooklyn. In the 1920s, due to the prohibition movement in the United States and pollution in Bowery Bay, the resorts at North Beach closed and the Junction line was truncated south of the former amusement area. In 1929, the Junction line was split from Grand Avenue service, becoming a shuttle between Corona Avenue and East Elmhurst. During the 1920s and 1930s, more conventional grid plans were laid down in Jackson Heights, Corona, and East Elmhurst. The winding and circuitous Jackson Mill Road, however, was preserved due to the presence of the streetcar line. In 1935, the Junction Boulevard line was rebuilt. The former dirt roadbed was replaced with concrete, to go along with heavier rails and improved trolley wire. In late 1936, Grand Avenue service was once again extended along Junction Boulevard. In 1938, the City of New York notified the B&QT to abandon the remaining line north of the planned Grand Central Parkway in the North Beach vicinity, due to the construction of the New York Municipal Airport on the Glenn H. Curtiss\/North Beach Airport site which replaced the resort area. Due to conflicts with the city over a potential extension to the new municipal airport, the Junction line was never extended to the facility. The last trolley to North Beach ran on December 9, 1938, after which service was truncated to Ditmars Boulevard at the south end of the 94th Street overpass over the Grand Central Parkway. The airport, later named LaGuardia Airport, opened on October 15, 1939, with special B&QT bus service between the trolleys and the Airport. Around this time, many streetcar lines in Queens and the rest of the city began to be replaced by buses, particularly after the unification of city's three primary transit companies (including the BMT) under municipal operations in June 1940.","h_score":1604211.1500000001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":48937209,"revid":1169695357,"description":"Bus route in Queens, New York","categories":["Bus routes in Queens, New York","Grand Street and Grand Avenue","LaGuardia Airport","MTA Regional Bus routes","Streetcar lines in Brooklyn","Streetcar lines in Queens, New York"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the Q72 bus?  \nA1: The Q72 is a New York City bus route operated by the MTA, linking Jackson Heights to Rego Park in Queens.  \n\nQ2: Where does it primarily operate?  \nA2: It runs mainly through Queens, weaving past vibrant neighborhoods and key stops.  \n\nQ3: How often does it run?  \nA3: Service varies, with buses every 10-15 minutes during peak hours, easing daily commutes.  \n\nQ4: What is its history?  \nA4: Established in the 1930s, it's evolved with city growth, adapting routes over decades.  \n\nQ5: Who uses it most?  \nA5: Locals, shoppers, and workers rely on it for affordable, efficient travel in bustling Queens.  \n\nQ6: How does it connect to other transport?  \nA6: It links to subway lines and other buses, forming a web of urban mobility options.  \n\nQ7: Are there any challenges?  \nA7: Traffic delays can occur, but improvements aim to keep rides smooth and reliable.  \n\nQ8: Any tips for riders?  \nA8: Check the MTA app for real-time updates, and enjoy the scenic Queens views along the way."}

The German fleet again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy it before the main British fleet could retaliate. During the operation, Ostfriesland was the lead ship in I Squadron's I Division and the ninth ship in the line, directly astern of the fleet flagship Friedrich der Grosse and ahead of her sister Th\u00fcringen. I Squadron was the center of the German line, behind the eight K\u00f6nig- and Kaiser-class battleships of III Squadron. The six elderly pre-dreadnoughts of III and IV Divisions\u2014II Battle Squadron\u2014formed the rear of the formation. Ostfriesland flew the flag of Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Erhardt Schmidt, the squadron commander during the battle and Scheer's deputy commander. Shortly before 16:00, the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group encountered the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron under the command of David Beatty. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of Indefatigable, shortly after 17:00, and Queen Mary, less than half an hour later. By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward the main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 17:30, the crew of the leading German battleship, K\u00f6nig, spotted both I Scouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching. The German battlecruisers were steaming to starboard, while the British ships steamed to port. At 17:45, Scheer ordered a two-point turn to port to bring his ships closer to the British battlecruisers and, a minute later, the order to open fire was given. While the leading battleships engaged the British battlecruiser squadron, Ostfriesland and ten other battleships fired on the British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron. Ostfriesland, Kaiser, and Nassau engaged the cruiser Southampton, though only Nassau scored a hit. After about 15 minutes, Ostfriesland shifted fire to Birmingham and Nottingham, though again failed to hit her targets. Shortly after 19:15, the British dreadnought Warspite came into range; Ostfriesland opened fire at 19:25 with her main battery guns, at ranges of 10,800 to 15,000 yd (9,900 to 13,700 m). Ostfriesland claimed hits from her third and fourth salvos. Warspite was hit by a total of thirteen heavy shells during this period.

The intelligence prompted Cameron and Hague to approve a United States special operations effort to rescue Norgrove during her 13th night of captivity. The operation was spearheaded by \"SEAL Team Six\", Navy SEALs from the Naval Special Warfare Development Group.\n\nThe SEALs staged a predawn raid on the Taliban hillside compound hideout, where Norgrove was held in a shack, on 8 October 2010. The stronghold was surrounded by 5-metre (16 ft) high, 1-metre (3 ft) thick perimeter walls in a densely wooded area in the village of Dineshgal, 2,400 metres (8,000 ft) up a steep mountain in the Korengal Valley.\n\nAt approximately 3:30 am, 20 SEALs and about 24 US Army Rangers from the 75th Ranger Regiment (wearing night-vision goggles) approached the compound, fast roping from two CH-47 Chinook helicopters. They were fired on from the compound and from a nearby position by Taliban armed with AK-47s, rocket-propelled grenades, and suicide vests. Two American snipers aboard a helicopter killed two guards using sound-suppressed rifles. An AC-130 Spectre gunship provided the US troops on the ground with close air support, killing two fleeing Taliban. The Rangers secured enemy positions on the nearby hills, and all six Taliban gunmen who fought the US forces were killed.\n\nDuring the gunfight, Norgrove's captors dragged her outside the building where she was being held, but she apparently broke away from them. Video footage of the raid showed an explosion in her vicinity; Norgrove was then found, injured, in a fetal position in a gully.\n\nNorgrove was removed from the scene via helicopter and received medical care, but she died. It was reported initially that she had been killed by one of her captors setting off a suicide vest. According to The Guardian, insurgents often put on suicide vests if they think they are in danger of being attacked. Taliban commanders Mullah Basir and Mullah Keftan (who were holding Norgrove) were among those killed in the raid, according to an Afghan intelligence official. Other women and children in the compound were uninjured, and no members of the rescue team were wounded.\n\n","h_score":1611203.4937500001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":29131336,"revid":1163187396,"description":"Kidnapping of aid workers","categories":["2010 in international relations","21st century in Kunar Province","Deaths by hand grenade","Deaths by person in Asia","Foreign hostages in Afghanistan","Kidnapping in Afghanistan","October 2010 events in Afghanistan","Prisoners of the Taliban","September 2010 crimes","September 2010 events in Asia","Taliban attacks","Terrorist incidents in Afghanistan in 2010","United Kingdom\u2013United States relations","United States Navy SEALs","War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021) casualties"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Linda Norgrove?  \nA1: A Scottish aid worker, boldly aiding war-torn regions like Afghanistan.  \n\nQ2: What happened to her?  \nA2: Kidnapped by militants in 2010, tragedy struck during rescue.  \n\nQ3: When and where did she die?  \nA3: October 2011, in Afghanistan's rugged mountains amid chaos.  \n\nQ4: Who led the rescue attempt?  \nA4: US special forces charged in, but fate twisted darkly.  \n\nQ5: Was friendly fire involved?  \nA5: Reports suggest yes, sparking shadowy debates on errors.  \n\nQ6: What controversies arose?  \nA6: Questions swirled about operation timing and unintended harm.  \n\nQ7: What lessons emerged?  \nA7: Highlighted rescue risks and aid worker vulnerabilities vividly.  \n\nQ8: What's her lasting impact?  \nA8: Inspires humanitarian bravery, a beacon in shadowed conflicts."}

Working for Sega's development division, he programmed arcade games including Ninja Princess, Alien Syndrome, and Choplifter. Although the exact date of the transition is not known, some time after the release of Power Drift, Sega began to separate the amusement division into the Amusement Machine Research and Development teams, or AM teams. AM1 was formed not long after the decision was made to separate the teams. Hisao Oguchi worked with AM1 before later going to AM3. Nakagawa was made manager of AM1 in September 1991. According to Nakagawa, he was working with AM2 with Yu Suzuki before being made head of AM1. He has also stated that his job focus had to change upon taking the new title, with less coding and more production and schedule management. Joining him at AM1 were members of Team Shinobi, who had developed Alien Syndrome and the arcade version of Golden Axe. AM1 also included Makoto Uchida, the lead developer for Golden Axe, who had also developed Altered Beast as well as several other Sega arcade titles. During the next few years, AM1 made several technological advances in their game development. The team used 3D computer graphics for the first time in 1994's Wing War, a game that would also be released for Sega's R360 arcade cabinet. AM1 would also develop Indy 500, which Nakagawa called his most memorable AM1 project and he credits it for AM1's ability to develop proper 3D games. From there, AM1 developed WaveRunner and The House of the Dead. AM1 also collaborated with Sega Technical Institute to develop and release Die Hard Arcade in 1996. According to developer Koichi Izumi, who had worked with AM1 before moving to AM3, AM1 had developed so many games that he lost count of them. Nakagawa has stated that he considered it good that AM1 did not have a specialty area and could develop almost any game as long as it was fun, and highlighted Wakuwaku Anpanman, a kiddie ride, as an example. AM1 also took charge of technical aspects of the NAOMI arcade system board. Some of AM1's other titles developed were Sega Bass Fishing, Sega Strike Fighter, and Wild Riders. In April 2000, Sega restructured its arcade and console development teams into nine semi-autonomous studios headed by the company's top designers. Sega's design houses were encouraged to experiment and benefited from a relatively lax approval process. Nakagawa chose the name Wow Entertainment for his new company, because it was an easy name to say in Japanese and also would work worldwide as a word in the English dictionary. At the time, Wow Entertainment had a staff of 120 and had 12 to 13 production lines, one of which was based in the United States. Though AM1 had previously focused on arcade games, Wow would split its time with console games as well. Wow also announced a collaboration with Nihon Television and Kodansha for the development of additional games. Wow's offices were based in Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan.","h_score":1605953.7562500001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":5864002,"revid":1153850537,"description":"Japanese development team within Sega","categories":["Defunct video game companies of Japan","Japanese companies disestablished in 2004","Japanese companies established in 2000","Sega divisions and subsidiaries","Video game companies disestablished in 2004","Video game companies established in 2000","Video game development companies"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's Sega AM1, in a nutshell?  \nA1: Sega AM1 was Sega's arcade magic factory, birthing hits like Daytona USA.\n\nQ2: When did it start rocking?  \nA2: Born in the early 1990s from Sega's R&D chaos, it electrified gaming arcades.\n\nQ3: What games did they spin?  \nA3: Think Virtua Fighter's punches and Scud Race's speed\u2014pure pixel adrenaline.\n\nQ4: How innovative were they?  \nA4: They twisted tech with 3D graphics that leaped off screens, redefining play.\n\nQ5: Who led the charge?  \nA5: Visionaries like Yu Suzuki steered the ship with bold, boundary-pushing flair.\n\nQ6: Did it impact the industry?  \nA6: Absolutely, sparking rival studios to chase their high-octane, immersive dreams.\n\nQ7: Why did it fade?  \nA7: As arcades dimmed in the 2000s, Sega reshuffled, absorbing AM1's spirit elsewhere.\n\nQ8: What's its lasting vibe?  \nA8: A wild legacy of joyrides and fighters, still fueling retro gaming nostalgia."}

Some of the letters belonged to one subject's name, and some of the letters belonged to the other subject's name, while some were random. In this design, any difference in preference between subjects would have to be based on whether the letter occurred in their name.\n\nFor example, take the fictitious pair Irma Maes and Jef Jacobs as shown in the table. The first stimulus is A and U: the last letter of Irma's first name and a letter not in her name. The next stimulus is M and D: the penultimate letter from Irma's first name and a letter not part of her name. As can be seen in the table this is repeated for the remaining letters of Irma's first name. The letters of her last name then also appear in reverse order, and finally the letters of both of Jef's names. The shading in the table reveals the pattern hidden to subjects, who would have been told to circle their preferred letter of each pair as fast as possible without thinking.\n\nIn the first trial, 38 Dutch-speaking local elementary school girls circled the letters they preferred in two yoked lists of letter pairs. A significant preference for the letters of one's own name over those of the other person was found. The second experiment used 98 Dutch-speaking local university students, to see if more years of reading made a difference. Four other factors were varied: either pairs or triads of letters; encircling the preferred letter or crossing out the less preferred ones; the letters QXYZ, infrequent in Dutch, included or excluded; own-name letters presented first or last. All conditions gave a name-letter effect, with a stronger effect when QXYZ were included and the less preferred letter was crossed out. No significant difference was found using family name rather than first name or both names. While the effect was strongest for initials, subsequent data analysis revealed a significant effect even without the first and last initials.\n\n ### Discussion\n\nNuttin concluded that the experiments showed that, independent of visual, acoustical, aesthetic, semantic, and frequency characteristics, letters belonging to one's own first and family names are preferred above other letters. He framed the effect in the context of narcissism, Gestalt theory and awareness, as reflected in the title of his 1985 article \"Narcissism beyond Gestalt and awareness: the name letter effect\", in which \"beyond Gestalt\" refers to the fact that subjects were not shown names, only letters in isolation, and \"beyond awareness\" to the fact that subjects did not realize that the letters of their own names were used. Nuttin claimed the effect he found was the first to go beyond Gestalt and awareness.\n\n ## Second study\n\nIn 1987 Nuttin published his second study, describing experiments done in 1984 and 1985 with the help of Hilde Sas. Because of the far-reaching implications of the name-letter effect for psychological theories, Nuttin found it wise to first test the effect's generality and robustness, before setting off on a research program aimed at understanding the underlying affective and cognitive processes at work. He wondered whether the effect would be found in all cultural and linguistic communities, or whether the first study revealed an effect due to some unknown idiosyncratic aspect of the Dutch language in Belgium.\n\n ### Method\n\nCross-lingual studies were performed at 13 European universities, using 12 different languages, viz. Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek (the only one with a non-Roman alphabet), Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish. Because the original yoked design did not lend itself well to long-distance research and standardization, it was replaced by a simpler, easier to replicate experimental design. Subjects were asked to mark the six capital letters they liked most in a randomized list containing all letters of the local alphabet, again without giving it much thought. They had to mark their first preference with 1, their second with 2, etc. The new method was first applied in Belgium. When results showed the name-letter effect at work again, it was copied in the other countries. A total of 2,047 subjects participated, all students.\n\n","h_score":1615933.76875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":14295551,"revid":1161869013,"description":"Tendency of people to prefer the letters in their name over other letters in the alphabet","categories":["1985 in science","Alphabets","Cognitive biases","Human names"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Name-Letter Effect: A Subtle Bias in Choices\n\nThe name-letter effect is a psychological phenomenon where people unconsciously prefer items sharing letters from their own name.

English Large White pigs were exported to Denmark in the early nineteenth century. From 1840 to 1870 grain was almost half of Denmark's exports, but by 1900 this had fallen to under 3 per cent. Denmark exported bacon to the United Kingdom from at least 1847, when flitches of bacon were specially prepared for the English market, but had no large-scale production until 1864, when the Second Schleswig War made export of live pigs to Hamburg, where up to then they had been slaughtered and cured, impossible and Denmark was forced to do this locally. However, export to the UK only became significant after Germany, to whom Denmark had been exporting since the Middle Ages, erected trade barriers to (1879), and finally banned (1887), the import of live pigs. The lost German market amounted to almost 300,000 pigs per year and Denmark desperately needed to find a new market. The Danish imports were welcomed in the UK; the growth in population following the Industrial Revolution meant that the country was no longer self-sufficient in food, but there was an increasing demand from a more affluent working class. The pig population grew from 442,441 in 1871 to nearly 2.5 million in 1914.\n\nAt the time, British workers on average pay consumed bacon two to three times a week, and bacon and eggs became the traditional British breakfast. This had previously been quite unaffordable for the working class. By the end of the 19th century, 90% of Danish pig exports went to the UK and accounted for 20% of total Danish exports. This made Denmark the main supplier to the UK, replacing the U.S. which previously held that position.

The piece's instrumentation is significant because it lacks harp, unusual percussion, and nonstandard woodwinds \u2013 a simpler orchestra than most of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's other orchestral works.

The day before, performances by Ray Charles and singing group Lambert, Hendricks and Ross were met with unruly crowds. About 300 drunken revelers made a commotion during Charles' performance and the police responded with teargas and water hoses. The riots became so out of control that the National Guard was called in at midnight to calm the crowd. When Waters and his band arrived on the scheduled day, they intended to drive back on the next day, until driver James Cotton saw John Lee Hooker standing at a corner, his guitar on his back without a guitar case. Cotton said Hooker should get into his car to get the musicians out of harm's way. At the same time, the city council decided to cancel the concert, but concert promoter George Wein convinced them when he said that the United States Information Agency (USIA) planned to film the festival to teach American culture in other countries.\n\nBefore Waters' performance, his band backed Otis Spann, who was the band leader, and John Lee Hooker. At about 7 p.m., Muddy Waters entered the stage, wearing black, while the rest of the band wore white suits. At Newport 1960 opens with then-unreleased \"I Got My Brand on You\", which was recorded one month prior, and \"(I'm Your) Hoochie Coochie Man\", both written by Willie Dixon. Next are the Big Joe Williams cover \"Baby Please Don't Go\", Oden's \"Soon Forgotten\", Dixon's \"Tiger in Your Tank\" and Broonzy's \"I Feel So Good\". At the end of \"I've Got My Mojo Working\", every bluesman gathered at the stage to perform medleys of blues standards. Jazz poet and directorate of Newport Langston Hughes spontaneously wrote a closing song, the slow \"Goodbye Newport Blues\", this time with Spann as singer, as Waters was too exhausted to perform.\n\nChess Records released the album in the U.S. on November 15, 1960, which was produced by label owner Leonard Chess. Chess issued the album on CD in 1986. MCA Records, the successor to Chess, digitally remastered it in 2001. The remastered version contains three bonus tracks recorded in Chicago in June 1960.\n\n ## Album cover\n\nThe album cover depicts Muddy Waters at the Newport Jazz Festival holding a semi-acoustic guitar. When the photographer, William Claxton, asked him to pose for the cover, Muddy left his Fender Telecaster (which he played during the concert) on the stage and instead held the semi-acoustic guitar, belonging to his friend John Lee Hooker.\n\n","h_score":1584264.2375,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":4525656,"revid":1122420562,"description":null,"categories":["1960 in Rhode Island","1960 live albums","Albums produced by Leonard Chess","Albums recorded at the Newport Jazz Festival","Chess Records live albums","MCA Records live albums","Muddy Waters live albums"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's \"At Newport 1960\" all about?  \nA1: It's a fiery live album by Muddy Waters from the 1960 Newport Jazz Festival, capturing electric blues rawness.  \n\nQ2: Who headlined that legendary gig?  \nA2: Muddy Waters, the blues king, electrified the stage with his Chicago-style band.  \n\nQ3: When and where did it happen?  \nA3: At the Newport Jazz Festival in Rhode Island, during July 1960's sweltering summer nights.  \n\nQ4: Why was it a big deal back then?  \nA4: It bridged folk and electric blues, sparking debates on authenticity amid festival crowds.  \n\nQ5: What key songs stole the show?  \nA5: Tracks like \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" pulsed with vivid energy, drawing thunderous cheers.  \n\nQ6: How did it shake up music history?  \nA6: It amplified blues' reach, influencing rock and roll's edgy evolution unexpectedly.  \n\nQ7: What was the audience's wild reaction?  \nA7: A mix of boos and bravos, as Waters' volume clashed with festival norms playfully.  \n\nQ8: What's its lasting vibe today?  \nA8: A timeless spark of rebellion, still inspiring musicians with its vivid, unpolished soul."}

It was directed by Diane Martel and choreographed by Tone & Rich. On October 15, 2009, images of the video were released. A countdown, including images and video previews, was announced on her official website and the release date was revealed to be on October 30, 2009. When asked about the video, Diane Martel said, > \"I think it's her next sexy video. It's a very simple video for her \u2013 I don't think you've seen her this much under a magnifying glass. Everything's really strong and playful. We collaborated on the wardrobe and had meetings about hair and makeup people, we talked a lot on the phone and met Tone and Rich \u2014 two of the best choreographers. [..] [Spears]' so sweet and funny and so normal and down to earth. It's really fun as a director to see her in front of the camera. She's so creative with this stuff. The video is very simple, it's very, very minimal. So it's her, her, her. And she's totally engaging every second. She really knows how to work with a camera and move. I was really impressed, and I have worked almost with every female artist in the business\". The video begins with Spears wearing a sparkly black dress at a dressing table, putting mascara and Circus Fantasy on. Then, it cuts to her holding her hair up and singing the first lines in front of a white background. There are also black and white scenes of her wearing a white leotard behind a foggy glass. She then appears wearing the leotard and glasses, while surrounded by four female dancers wearing black outfits, hanging from a raised barre. The word \"sin\" is censored and changed for the word \"this\" during the pre-chorus. In the chorus, she dances in front of a white wall with barcode-like light installations with six male dancers. There also scenes of her dancing provocatively with two male dancers. At the bridge, there are intercut close-ups of her that end with a smirk. The video concludes with Spears dancing with the two male dancers and cuts to a close-up of her looking into the camera. Rolling Stone writer Daniel Kreps compared the video with the music video of \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" and complimented the choreography saying Spears had not danced with so much conviction since the In the Zone era. Bradley Stern of MuuMuse likened the video's choreography and dancer's wardrobe to Janet Jackson's \"Feedback\" video. Jocelyn Vena of MTV gave the video a positive review, stating that it's a \"sexy, fast-paced clip\" and that \"there are a few moments in the video where Britney's personality shines\" adding that \"she smiles at the song's tongue-in-cheek lyrics, particularly when she finishes the song's bridge.\" Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly complimented the video's choice of wardrobe, but said that the video was \"sparse\", adding \"there's not much to the single besides trite, ridiculous advocation for a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois anyway, so why would the video go any deeper?\". On December 15, 2009, a director's cut version of the video for \"3\" leaked online. Kreps commented that the new version \"offers up a slightly more NSFW edit of Martel's dance-heavy vid that seems to find a better cadence with the music, as opposed to the original version, which was essentially filmed and edited in the matter of days to coincide with The Singles Collection release\".","h_score":1625957.2437500001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":24449241,"revid":1171374181,"description":"2009 single by Britney Spears","categories":["2009 singles","2009 songs","Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles","Britney Spears songs","Canadian Hot 100 number-one singles","Group sex","Jive Records singles","Music videos directed by Diane Martel","Song recordings produced by Max Martin","Song recordings produced by Shellback (record producer)","Songs written by Max Martin","Songs written by Shellback (record producer)","Songs written by Sophia Somajo"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the song \"3\"?  \nA1: \"3\" is a pop track by Britney Spears, released in 2009 as a single.  \n\nQ2: Who created it?  \nA2: Britney Spears performed it, with writing credits to her and producers like Max Martin.  \n\nQ3: When was it released?  \nA3: It debuted in September 2009 on her compilation album.  \n\nQ4: What's the theme?  \nA4: The lyrics playfully explore a threesome, adding a cheeky twist to pop romance.  \n\nQ5: How was it received?  \nA5: It hit the top of charts worldwide, blending catchy beats with bold vibes.  \n\nQ6: What style does it feature?  \nA6: It's electro-pop with infectious rhythms and Spears' signature flair.  \n\nQ7: Any controversies?  \nA7: Its provocative lyrics sparked debates, yet boosted her edgy image.  \n\nQ8: What's its cultural impact?  \nA8: \"3\" highlighted Spears' evolution, influencing pop's daring edge subtly."}

She has a cold demeanor, which was meant to clash in an entertaining way with the outspokenness of Snow Villiers. Nomura commented that Lightning has \"a strong element of mystery about her character\". She originally had a flirtatious aspect to her personality, which was transferred to Oerba Yun Fang when Fang was changed from male to female. Daisuke Watanabe, writer for the XIII trilogy, paid particular attention in the original game to fleshing out Lightning's non-romantic relationship with Snow, and to showing her development as a person while protecting Hope Estheim.\n\nFor Lightning Returns, the developers wanted to portray Lightning in several different lights, in contrast to her static personalities in prior appearances. One of their highest priorities was to make Lightning a character who had lost much in her life and become deeply vulnerable as a result. Designer Yuji Abe elaborated that, because of her losses and newfound vulnerability, Lightning came across as darker, slightly numbed to her surroundings, and \"like a puppet, like someone who doesn't quite have her real self inside\". He elaborated that this effect shows \"the kind of vulnerability she has, and it's the point from which she starts to change afterward\". The decision to expand her personality in this way was originally suggested by producer Yoshinori Kitase, who was concerned that Lightning's coolness in previous games had made it difficult for players to bond with her. Lightning's motion capture actress across the XIII games was Naho Nakashima. She described the experience as enjoyable and ultimately emotional, describing Lightning in 2013 as \"a precious existence\" for her.\n\nAcross her speaking appearances, Lightning is voiced by Ali Hillis in English and Maaya Sakamoto in Japanese. Sakamoto was impressed by Lightning, whom she called \"cold\" and \"strong\". She was asked to portray Lightning's strength while showing hidden vulnerabilities. Voicing Lightning was initially strange as she was used to gentler roles such as Aerith Gainsborough, a central character in Final Fantasy VII and its companion media. Commenting on the difficulty of balancing Lightning's depiction as a woman and a trained warrior, Kitase noted that Sakamoto's acting helped to bring out Lightning's femininity. Hillis was given the role of Lightning after speaking a few of the character's lines during audition, and was then given a book about the Final Fantasy XIII universe, which she found a little \"overwhelming\" when she read it. One of the challenges Hillis faced was recapturing the emotion and energy of Sakamoto's Japanese performance in the character's English rendition. Hillis described her main priority across the series as portraying \"every single layer of who [Lightning] was as a person\", working with staff to make her seem like a real person. Hillis felt that Lightning's character became more sarcastic and battle-hardened by the events of Lightning Returns.\n\n ## Appearances\n\n","h_score":1634872.26875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":24829866,"revid":1171083481,"description":"Fictional character of the Final Fantasy series","categories":["Characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura","Deity characters in video games","Female characters in video games","Female soldier and warrior characters in video games","Fictional characters with healing abilities","Fictional female swordfighters","Fictional goddesses","Fictional military sergeants","Fictional swordfighters in video games","Final Fantasy XIII","Final Fantasy characters","Square Enix protagonists","Time travelers","Video game characters introduced in 2009","Video game characters who use magic","Video game characters with electric or magnetic abilities"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Lightning in Final Fantasy?  \nA1: Lightning's the fierce, pink-haired warrior from Final Fantasy XIII, a soldier forged in crystal chaos.\n\nQ2: What game introduces her?  \nA2: She debuts in Final Fantasy XIII, zipping through a dystopian world of fal'Cie gods and l'Cie curses.\n\nQ3: What's her personality like?  \nA3: She's stoic and determined, a blade of resolve with a soft core, balancing duty and emotion in vivid battles.\n\nQ4: What are her key abilities?  \nA4: Wielding gunswords with flair, she masters commando strikes and ravager spells, dancing through enemies in electrifying style.\n\nQ5: How does she drive the story?  \nA5: As a l'Cie on a perilous quest, she fights fate's chains, her journey a whirlwind of rebellion and redemption.\n\nQ6: Does she appear in other games?  \nA6: Yes, she stars in sequels like Lightning Returns, evolving through time-warped realms with unexpected twists.\n\nQ7: How do fans view her?  \nA7: Fans adore her as a strong female icon, her complex arc sparking debates and cosplay in vibrant communities.\n\nQ8: What's her lasting impact?  \nA8: Lightning electrifies the series by challenging tropes, her saga a bold, crystal-shard reflection on heroism's edges."}

The commission was originally intended for Daniel Chester French, but, according to a paper by Zelotes W. Coombs, French turned down the commission due to \"pressure of other engagements, however... he did supervise the work.\" French assigned the design of the basin to Henry Bacon, who would later work with French on the Lincoln Memorial. The sculpture was assigned to Charles Y. Harvey, a graduate of the American Academy in Rome, who had worked with Augustus Saint-Gaudens on the Robert Gould Shaw Memorial in Boston. Charles Y. Harvey began work on Boy with Turtle at his studio in New York City, believing that this work was going to be his masterpiece. Almost immediately he began second guessing his design and feeling that it was inadequate. This negativity was a trait that he had shown many times in the past. Roughly a week after beginning the sculpture, Harvey began hearing voices commanding him to kill himself. A paper about restoring the sculpture written at Worcester Polytechnic Institute claims the voices he was hearing were coming from the partially carved sculpture itself. These voices set the date of Saturday January 27, 1912 for Harvey to kill himself. On that date he laid down his tools, headed to Bronx Park with two razors, and slit his own throat along the west bank of the Bronx River. After Harvey's death, Sherry Fry, a fellow American Academy graduate, was invited to finish the work according to the original designs Harvey had laid out. Fry completed the sculpture, and it was delivered along with the basin to Worcester in 1912. There had been much discussion about where to install the fountain. Central Square, just off the Worcester Common was chosen with only slight opposition from \"market gardeners who had been using the east end of the Common for their summer outdoor market.\" When it was installed in Central Square, There was no dedication ceremony or unveiling for the fountain. A news article on October 11, 1912, stated that Worcester Mayor Philip O\u2019Connell, \"believes it will be well to have the fountain placed in use without ceremony.\u201d This lack of a ceremony is presumably due to Harvey's suicide and the desire to not celebrate such an act. By 1912, the use of horse and buggy had fallen out of fashion, and the Burnside Fountain saw little use in its intended purpose. By 1939 citizens of Worcester were already calling for the fountain to be moved to a more suitable place where it could be of more use. It took until 1969 for the Burnside Fountain to be moved from Central Square. It was relocated to the Worcester Common and turned to face Salem Square. One year later, in May 1970, the statue was ripped from its pedestal and stolen. It was returned later that same year, but it took until 1972 for the boy and turtle to be placed back on top of the basin. Another apparent theft attempt happened in 2004 when the bronze sculpture was toppled off its pedestal and left dangling off the basin. The city was quick to fix the statue this time, with it being righted and reattached within days. In 2010, the Burnside Fountain was named one of WAAF's \"Hill-Man's 25 Greatest Places in Massachusetts.\" That same year, it was also nominated for \"Worst Public Art in New England\" by a regional Art blog. Around this same time a small group of volunteers began the \"Turtle Boy Urban Gardeners,\" a group dedicated to keeping the plantings around the Burnside Fountain presentable. For the last few decades the Burnside Fountain has been in disrepair. A 1986 inventory of public memorials in Worcester, compiled by the municipal parks and recreation department, listed the fountain's problems as \"chipped stone, water system, bronze surface corrosion, rust staining, litter,\" and the Smithsonian Art Inventories Catalog surveyed the fountain in September 1994 and listed its condition as \"treatment urgent.\" With the one-hundredth anniversary of the Burnside Fountain coming in 2012, there has been renewed interest in restoring the fountain. Restoration estimates run between USD \\$40,000 to \\$60,000, which is more than the city is willing to spend. Probably because of this, there are no official plans to restore the fountain, as of June 2012.

A proposal was submitted to Neroulos and Rangavis, now Neroulos's superior in the Ministry of Education; the organisation's founding documents were completed in the name of the Archaeological Society of Athens on , and its foundation ratified by a royal decree of . Neroulos became the society's first president, with Rangavis as its secretary and Pittakis a member of its ephorate (board of overseers). Where Rangavis, Neroulos and Bellios were wealthy Phanariots (a class of mostly-wealthy Greek merchants from Istanbul, who had enjoyed special privileges in the administration of the Ottoman Empire), Pittakis was unusual in the new society in being both Athenian and of a humble background, a factor which created tension between him and the other elites of the society. The Society held its first meeting on , in the Parthenon. The Archaeological Society aimed to support the Greek Archaeological Service, which had minimal financial and human resources, in conserving, studying and excavating the monuments of Greece. Along with Rangavis, Pittakis launched and edited the periodical Archaeological Journal, which remains one of the society's main publications as of 2023. Rangavis soon resigned as co-editor, leaving Pittakis as effectively the sole writer of the journal until 1860. From 1837, Pittakis, assisted by the Swiss sculptor Heinrich Max Imhof and Ross's former collaborators Schaubert and Laurent, carried out restoration work in the Archaeological Society's name on the Acropolis. His work at the site has been described as the beginning of a \"large-scale purification project\", aimed at the removal of all of the Acropolis's post-classical remains. Throughout 1837\u20131840, he reconstructed the naos of the Erechtheion, a building he described as having \"fallen down\", using modern bricks to replace areas of fallen stonework. He also extended the height of some collapsed columns and rearranged surviving fragments of the building to emphasise the best preserved. During the reconstruction, one of the south porch's caryatids, which had fallen during the fighting of the War of Independence, was found and returned to its plinth. Pittakis also excavated the building, down to the floor level of its phase as a Christian church (between approximately the sixth and the fifteenth centuries), uncovering tombs in the southern part and a cistern in the western area. On , he wrote to the Ministry of Education, proposing that a royal decree be issued to dramatically expand the powers of the state to protect antiquities and prosecute those damaging them, but his letter was never acted upon. From 1841, he began to collaborate with Rangavis on the restoration of the Parthenon, having previously excavated its pronaos in the late 1830s.","h_score":1610610.8687500001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":1360041,"revid":1173370382,"description":"Greek archaeologist (1798\u20131863)","categories":["1798 births","1863 deaths","19th-century archaeologists","Archaeologists from Athens","Ephors General of Greece","Greek people of the Greek War of Independence","Members of the Filiki Eteria","Mycenae"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Kyriakos Pittakis: Unearthing Athens' Hidden Wonders\n\nKyriakos Pittakis, a 19th-century Greek archaeologist, revolutionized excavations at the Acropolis, revealing ancient artifacts that captivate scholars today.

In Uden Soegija spent a year further studying Latin and Greek, necessary for his preaching back in the Indies. He and his classmates adapted to Dutch culture. On 27 September 1920 Soegija began his novitiate to join the Jesuits, the first of his classmates. While completing his studies at Mari\u00ebndaal in Grave, he was separated from much of the world and spent his time in introspection. He completed his novitiate on 22 September 1922 and was initiated into the Jesuits, taking their oath of poverty, chastity and obedience. After joining the Jesuits Soegija spent another year in Mari\u00ebndaal in juniorate. Beginning in 1923 he studied philosophy at Berchmann College in Oudenbosch; during this time he examined the teachings of Thomas Aquinas and began writing on Christianity. In a letter dated 11 August 1923, he wrote that the Javanese were so far unable to discern between Catholics and Protestants, and that the best way to convert the Javanese was by deeds, not words. He also translated some of the results of the 27th International Eucharistic Congress, held in Amsterdam in 1924, for the Javanese-language magazine Swaratama, which circulated mainly among Xaverius alumni. Several of Soegija's other writings were published in St. Claverbond, Berichten uit Java. He graduated from Berchmann in 1926, then began preparations to return to the Indies. Soegija arrived in Muntilan in September 1926, where he began teaching algebra, religion, and Javanese at Xaverius. Little is known about his period as an instructor at the school, although records indicate that he based his teaching style on that of van Lith, who had died in early 1926, explaining religious concepts in terms based on Javanese tradition. He supervised the school's gamelan and gardening programs and became the chief editor of Swaratama. Soegijapranata wrote editorials that covered a variety of topics, including condemnations of communism and discussions of various aspects of poverty. After two years at Xaverius, in August 1928, Soegija returned to the Netherlands, where he studied theology at Maastricht. On 3 December 1929 he and four other Asian Jesuits joined Jesuit General Wlodzimierz Led\u00f3chowski in a meeting with Pope Pius XI in Vatican City; the pope told the Asian men that they were to be the \"backbones\" of Catholicism in their respective nations. Soegija was made a deacon in May 1931; he was ordained by Bishop of Roermond Laurentius Schrijnen on 15 August 1931, while still studying theology. After his ordination, Soegija appended the word pranata, meaning \"prayer\" or \"hope\", as a suffix to his birth name; such additions were a common practice in Javanese culture after its bearer reached an important milestone. He finished his theology studies in 1932 and in 1933 spent his tertianship in Drongen, Belgium. That year he wrote an autobiography, entitled La Conversione di un Giavanese (The Conversion of a Javanese); the work was released in Italian, Dutch, and Spanish.","h_score":1583689.0125000002,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":36278145,"revid":1169917178,"description":"Indonesian Catholic archbishop (1896\u20131963)","categories":["1896 births","1963 deaths","20th-century Roman Catholic archbishops in Indonesia","Clergy in World War II","Converts to Roman Catholicism from Islam","Indonesian Jesuits","Indonesian Roman Catholics","Indonesian former Muslims","Javanese people","Jesuit archbishops","National Heroes of Indonesia","People from Surakarta"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Albertus Soegijapranata?  \nA1: He was an Indonesian Roman Catholic archbishop and national hero.  \n\nQ2: When and where was he born?  \nA2: He was born in 1896 in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.  \n\nQ3: What was his role in Indonesian independence?  \nA3: He supported the independence movement through advocacy and diplomacy.  \n\nQ4: How did he contribute to the Catholic Church?  \nA4: He led the Archdiocese of Semarang and promoted interfaith harmony.  \n\nQ5: What educational efforts did he make?  \nA5: He founded schools and emphasized education for all Indonesians.  \n\nQ6: Was he recognized officially?  \nA6: Yes, he was declared a national hero by the Indonesian government.  \n\nQ7: What were his key beliefs?  \nA7: He advocated for social justice and national unity.  \n\nQ8: How is he remembered today?  \nA8: His legacy inspires efforts in education and religious tolerance in Indonesia."}

It was co-written by Sia in collaboration with Mikkel Storleer Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen. The track was produced by Elliott Wheeler and The Get Down director, Baz Luhrmann. While it was available to download from the soundtrack upon its release, it was promoted in Italy to contemporary hit radio as a single on August 23, 2016. Various remixes were also released throughout the following month.\n\nMusically, \"Telepathy\" is a disco track reminiscent of the genre in the 1970s, reflecting the theme of the TV series, which documents the fall of disco and the rise of hip hop in that era. Aguilera's strong vocals were praised by music critics, with one in particular comparing her falsetto melismas to the style of Mariah Carey. \"Telepathy\" became Aguilera's ninth and Rodgers' fourth number-one song on the US Billboard Dance Club Songs chart, respectively. As a thank you gift to her fans, radio, and DJs for playing the track and making it number-one on the chart, Aguilera self-produced a short, disco-themed music video for the song.\n\n ## Background and release\n\nComposed and written by Sia, Mikkel Storleer Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen, \"Telepathy\" is a song recorded by Christina Aguilera featuring Nile Rodgers for the accompanying soundtrack to the Netflix musical drama series The Get Down (2016). The Get Down, directed by Australian Baz Luhrmann, is set in The Bronx in the late 1970s and chronicles the fall of disco and the rise of hip hop. Luhrmann, alongside Elliot Wheeler, produced \"Telepathy\", marking the second time he and Aguilera had worked together; Luhrmann directed the 2001 musical film Moulin Rouge! whereby Aguilera was one of the lead acts on the soundtrack single \"Lady Marmalade\". Furler recorded a demo version of the song but it has never been officially released.\n\nThe track listing for the soundtrack was released on August 4, 2016; Mike Wass of Idolator noted that \"Telepathy\" could possibly be a disco track given that Rodgers is credited as a featured artist and the disco theme of the series. \"Telepathy\" premiered on August 11, the day before the release of the soundtrack and TV series. The song was released in Italy to contemporary hit radio on August 23. Multiple remixes were commissioned and made available for digital download. On September 16, a six-track remix EP was released featuring remixes by Rare Candy, Eric Kupper, Solidisco, Malay & Young Bombs, Tobtok and Moto Blanco. Another remix by Le Youth was released September 30. Daniel Megarry of the Gay Times suggested that the release of the remixes was an effort to boost sales of the track.\n\n ## Composition\n\n\"Telepathy\" is a disco song which lasts for a duration of three minutes, eleven seconds. The \"dreamy\" and \"euphoric\" instrumentation, provided by Nile Rodgers, Homer Steinweiss, Nick Movshon and Thomas Brenneck, consists of \"vibrant\" strings and horns, drums, brass and harps. PopCrush writer Bradley Stern noted that the addition of Rodgers \"signature joyful, dance floor-friendly\" sound adds a \"touch of authenticity\". Producer Nelson George described the track as being reminiscent of \"1970s vogueing anthems popular at vogue-club balls like the House of LaBeija.\" Entertainment Weekly writer Joey Nolfi placed \"Telepathy\" somewhere in between the compositions of her fifth studio album Back to Basics (2006) and the lead single from her seventh album Lotus, \"Your Body\" (2012).\n\n","h_score":1590586.21875,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":51309394,"revid":1171677442,"description":null,"categories":["2016 singles","2016 songs","Christina Aguilera songs","Disco songs","Music videos directed by Hannah Lux Davis","Nile Rodgers songs","RCA Records singles","Song recordings produced by Nile Rodgers","Songs from television series","Songs written by Sia (musician)"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is \"Telepathy\" by Claire Rosinkranz?  \nA1: \"Telepathy\" is a lively pop song released in 2020, capturing instant emotional connections like a spark in the dark.  \n\nQ2: Who created the song?  \nA2: It's by Claire Rosinkranz, a young American singer-songwriter known for her fresh, relatable vibes.  \n\nQ3: When was it released?  \nA3: The track dropped in August 2020 as a single, quickly buzzing through digital platforms.  \n\nQ4: What themes does it explore?  \nA4: It delves into telepathic-like bonds in relationships, weaving imagery of unspoken feelings into catchy lyrics.  \n\nQ5: How was it received by listeners?  \nA5: Fans praised its upbeat energy and authenticity, making it a viral hit on social media.  \n\nQ6: What genre does it belong to?  \nA6: It's primarily pop with indie influences, blending sunny melodies and rhythmic hooks for a modern twist.  \n\nQ7: What inspired the lyrics?  \nA7: Rosinkranz drew from personal experiences of deep connections, painting vivid word pictures of intuitive links.  \n\nQ8: Why is it culturally relevant today?  \nA8: In a digital age, it echoes themes of virtual empathy, resonating as a fun yet thoughtful anthem for youth."}

Though bands of roving criminals were common in many parts of Illinois, the counties of Lee, DeKalb, Ogle, and Winnebago were especially plagued by them. The new crime wave in the region of the frontier Midwest may have occurred following the crackdown on Southern outlaws by the rising vigilante-regulator movement and the breakup of the criminal syndicate of John A. Murrell and his gang, the \"Mystic Clan\" in the Southern United States. In 1841, the escalating pattern of house burglary, horse and cattle theft, stagecoach and highway robbery, counterfeiting, and murder associated with the Banditti had come to a head in Ogle County. As the crimes continued, local citizens formed bands of vigilantes known as Regulators. A clash between the Banditti and the Regulators in Ogle County near Oregon, Illinois, resulted in the outlaws' demise and decreased Banditti activity and violent crime within the county.\n\nBanditti and Regulator activity continued well after the lynching that took place in 1841. Crimes continued, committed by both sides, across northern and central Illinois. The Banditti were involved in other notable events, as well, including the 1845 torture-murder of merchant Colonel George Davenport, the namesake of Davenport, Iowa. Edward Bonney, an amateur detective who hunted down and brought to justice the killers, wrote of his exploits and alibi, which were recounted in his book, Banditti of the Prairies, or the Murderer's Doom!!: A Tale of the Mississippi Valley, published in Chicago in 1850. The outlaw gangs also continued to be active in Lee and Winnebago Counties following the events in Oregon.\n\n ## Banditti influence\n\nThe \"Prairie Bandits\" were active across northern Illinois, especially in Lee, Ogle, Winnebago, and DeKalb Counties, from 1835 until the events leading to their ultimate demise began on March 21, 1841. The bandits wielded considerable influence in the area collectively known as the Rock River Valley, following the influx of immigrants after the Black Hawk War of 1832, the last Indian war in Illinois. The Banditti posed a far greater threat, for a much longer period, than the exaggerated paranoia of the two-month Native American conflict. Former Illinois Governor Thomas Ford wrote in History of Illinois:\n\n> ... the northern part of the State was not destitute of its organized bands of rogues engaged in murders, robberies, horsestealing, and in making and passing counterfeit money. These rogues were scattered all over the north: but the most of them were located in the counties of Ogle, Winnebago, Lee and DeKalb. In the county of Ogle they were so numerous, strong, and organized that they could not be convicted for their crimes.\n\n ## Banditti activity\n\nIn Lee County, Illinois, the Banditti also had enough power to get away unnoticed. The group had enough allies that they were scattered throughout the county. The connections the Banditti had around the county made illegal activities such as counterfeiting and dealing in and concealing stolen property easy to perpetrate. At one time, every township officer in Lee County reportedly was a member of the Banditti. Acts of theft were carried on in defiance of authority. Citizens were threatened when they tried to seek redress from the thieves.\n\nIn the end, the Prairie Bandits' activity in Ogle and Lee Counties became more than area residents were willing to withstand. In Ogle County, the crimes that occurred in March 1841 resulted in a kangaroo court, which culminated with the lynching of two Banditti near Oregon, Illinois. In nearby Lee County, a Vigilance Committee was formed by men from throughout Lee County, and especially Lee Center Township took an active role in suppressing the Banditti activity.\n\n","h_score":1615354.4437500001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":9872937,"revid":1155866635,"description":"Group of loose-knit outlaw gangs, during the early-mid-19th century","categories":["1830s in Illinois","1840s in Illinois","1841 in Illinois","Gangs in Illinois","Ogle County, Illinois","Outlaw gangs in the United States","Riots and civil disorder in Illinois"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the Banditti of the Prairie?  \nA1: It was a group of outlaws active in the 19th-century American Midwest.  \n\nQ2: Who were the members?  \nA2: Mostly counterfeiters, horse thieves, and fugitives from justice.  \n\nQ3: When were they active?  \nA3: Primarily in the 1840s, with some activity in the 1830s.  \n\nQ4: Where did they operate?  \nA4: Mainly in Illinois and surrounding prairie regions.  \n\nQ5: What crimes did they commit?  \nA5: Counterfeiting, horse theft, and robbery of travelers.  \n\nQ6: How did they organize?  \nA6: Through secret networks to evade law enforcement.  \n\nQ7: What was their impact?  \nA7: They disrupted local economies and challenged authority.  \n\nQ8: How were they stopped?  \nA8: Through arrests and stronger regional policing efforts."}

Six thousand sheep were killed on ranches near the base, and the popular explanation blamed Army testing of chemical weapons for the incident, though alternative explanations have been offered. A report, commissioned by Air Force Press Officer Jesse Stay and first made public in 1998, was called the \"first documented admission\" from the Army that a nerve agent killed the sheep at Skull Valley.\n\n ## Background\n\nSince its founding in 1941, much of the activity at Dugway Proving Ground has been a closely guarded secret. Activities at Dugway included aerial nerve agent testing. According to reports from New Scientist, Dugway was still producing small quantities of non-infectious anthrax of a type used in the making of vaccines as late as 1998, 30 years after the United States renounced biological weapons. There were at least 1,100 other chemical tests at Dugway during the time period of the Dugway sheep incident. In total, almost 500,000 lb (230,000 kg) of nerve agent were dispersed during open-air tests. There were also tests at Dugway with other weapons of mass destruction, including 332 open-air tests of biological weapons, 74 dirty bomb tests, and eight furnace heatings of nuclear material under open air conditions to simulate the dispersal of fallout in the case of meltdown of aeronautic nuclear reactors.\n\n ## Incident\n\nIn the days preceding the Dugway sheep incident the United States Army at Dugway Proving Ground conducted at least three separate operations involving nerve agents. All three operations occurred on March 13, 1968. One involved the test firing of a chemical artillery shell, another the burning of 160 U.S. gallons (600 liters) of nerve agent in an open air pit and in the third a jet aircraft spraying nerve agent in a target area about 27 mi (43 km) west of Skull Valley. It is the third event that is usually connected to the Skull Valley sheep kill.\n\nThe incident log at Dugway Proving Ground indicated that the sheep incident began with a phone call on March 17, 1968, at 12:30 a.m. The director of the University of Utah's ecological and epidemiological contact with Dugway, a Dr. Bode, phoned Keith Smart, the chief of the ecology and epidemiology branch at Dugway to report that 3,000 sheep were dead in the Skull Valley area. The initial report of the incident came to Bode from the manager of a Skull Valley livestock company. The sheep were grazing in an area about 27 mi (43 km) from the proving ground; total sheep deaths of 6,000\u20136,400 were reported over the next several days as a result of the incident. The Dugway Safety Office's attempt to count the dead sheep compiled a total of 3,843.\n\n ## Possible causes\n\nPreviously obtained documents said a nerve agent demonstration occurred the day before the sheep deaths. On March 13, 1968, a F-4 Phantom fighter aircraft flew a test mission over the Dugway Proving Ground with chemical dispensers containing the nerve agent VX. One of the dispensers was not completely emptied during the test, and as the F-4 gained altitude after its bombing run, VX trickled out in a trail behind the aircraft, drifted into Skull Valley, north of the proving ground, and settled over a huge flock of sheep.\n\nOne explanation in the aftermath of the incident was that a chemical or biological agent had escaped from the Dugway Proving Ground. Circumstantial evidence seemed to support this assertion; the United States Army admitted to conducting open-air tests with VX in the days preceding the sheep kill. The Army intimated that a spray nozzle had malfunctioned during the test causing an aircraft to continue spraying VX as it climbed to higher altitudes. It was reported that a small amount of VX was found in the tissue of the dead sheep.\n\nOther information contradicted the initial assumptions. One contradiction to nerve agent exposure as a cause came in the symptoms of some of the sheep following the incident. Several sheep, still alive, sat unmoving on the ground. The sheep refused to eat, but exhibited normal breathing patterns and showed signs of internal hemorrhaging. Regular breathing and internal hemorrhaging are inconsistent with nerve agent exposure, and \"no other animals of any type, including cows, horses, dogs, rabbits, or birds, appeared to have suffered any ill effects, a circumstance that was hard to explain if VX had in fact caused the sheep deaths.\"\n\n","h_score":1583117.0750000002,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":14435745,"revid":1149395471,"description":"1968 mass killing of sheep in Utah, U.S.","categories":["1968 animal deaths","1968 in Utah","1968 in military history","20th-century history of the United States Army","Chemical warfare","Chemical weapons of the United States","March 1968 events in the United States","Military in Utah","Military scandals","Non-combat military accidents","Sheep farming in the United States"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What was the Dugway sheep incident?  \nA1: In 1968, it was a Utah fiasco where thousands of sheep keeled over like fallen soldiers in a chemical fog.

He began studying music aged 10, eventually enrolling at the Paris Conservatoire. After refusing to attend the classes of a teacher he disliked, Fanelli was expelled from the conservatoire, following which he earned his income by playing timpani for small orchestras. In 1876, he was re-admitted to the conservatoire and studied composition with the French composer L\u00e9o Delibes. A balance between working and studying proved arduous, and Fanelli progressed slowly; he later quit due to financial issues. From then on, he made a living playing percussion and piano and studied musical scores to improve his technical proficiency. At the age of 22, Fanelli started composing seriously, producing various orchestral and chamber pieces. Unsuccessful in securing their performance, he worked as a copyist and music engraver and resigned from composition in 1894.\n\nIn 1912, Fanelli applied to work as a copyist for the composer and conductor Gabriel Piern\u00e9. The latter received a neatly written manuscript by Fanelli, of which the musical content greatly impressed him. It was the manuscript of Fanelli's symphonic poem Th\u00e8bes, the first part of Tableaux Symphoniques, which he said was composed 29 years prior. A stunned Piern\u00e9 remarked that the piece is \"astonishingly modern considering the time when he began to write\". He quickly arranged a performance of Th\u00e8bes with the Colonne Orchestra, which he conducted on 17 March 1912. It was a triumphant success, although it didn't convince Fanelli to return to composition. There were performances of Impressions pastorales on 23 February 1913 and F\u00eate dans le palais du Pharaon (the second set of Tableaux Symphoniques) on 30 May, conducted by Piern\u00e9 respectively. After this, Fanelli fell into obscurity and was struggling to support his family. Judith Gautier and her father Th\u00e9ophile had supported him financially, convinced that he would be considered one of the great composers. He died in Paris on 24 November 1917.\n\n ## Works\n\nFanelli stopped composing in 1894, and in the period between that and meeting Piern\u00e9 in 1912, he was void of any musical ideas, presumably owing to his financial situation. Most of Fanelli's compositions are long in duration\u2014the Impressions pastorales, for example, requires 3 hours, and the orchestrally-accompanied songs being described as unusually long. The music critic Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi argues that this discouraged performances of his works, but that it highlights Fanelli's capability of \"abundant invention\" without redundancy. Judith Gautier believed that this was due to the modernism in Fanelli's works. He often displayed dark humor in his compositions. For instance, in the lyric work L'Effroi du soleil (\"Fear of the sun\"), the executioner runs after a severed head that bounced from the scaffold, only to confuse it with the setting sun.\n\n ### Orchestral\n\nThe musicologist William Rosar notes that wind band timbres appealed to Fanelli, who in some orchestral compositions used sarrusophones and saxhorns. He also often used full orchestras with a large brass section. In an article about Fanelli works, Ezra Pound wrote that the modernism in Fanelli's orchestral compositions such as L'Effroi du Soleil and Suite rabelaisienne would have \"made Berlioz turn pale\". Suite rabelaisienne is based on three chapters from Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais's Gargantua and Pantagruel.\n\nImpressions pastorales is a symphonic suite of 22 short movements, written in 1890, which premiered on 30 May 1913 with Piern\u00e9 as conductor.

The NDH was created from parts of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia on 10 April 1941, four days after the World War II invasion of Yugoslavia by the Axis powers commenced. The RMNDH consisted of two commands, the Coast and Maritime Traffic Command, and the River and River Traffic Command, and had its headquarters in the NDH capital, Zagreb. The Coast and Maritime Traffic Command consisted of three naval commands along the Adriatic coast, which were each divided into a number of naval districts. The naval districts consisted mainly of naval and weather stations, and were only responsible for coast guard and customs duties. The River and River Traffic Command consisted of seven river stations, a naval infantry battalion, and a River Command Flotilla built around two former Yugoslav river monitors, which had been scuttled during the invasion but subsequently refloated.\n\nThe RMNDH was only a small part of the armed forces of the NDH, largely due to restrictions imposed by Italy under the Treaties of Rome. To avoid these limitations, the Germans raised the Croatian Naval Legion which fought as part of the German Navy in the Black Sea campaign between 1941 and 1944. After the Italian capitulation in September 1943, the Germans transferred several captured Italian vessels to the RMNDH, including the light cruiser Dalmacija (renamed Zniam), the former Yugoslav torpedo boat T7, and the Malinska-class mining tender Mosor. All of the significant assets had been lost by December 1944 when the remaining personnel were assigned to duties ashore to circumvent their defection to the Yugoslav Partisans. The RMNDH was disbanded in May 1945 with the collapse and defeat of the NDH.\n\n","h_score":1627012.2875000001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":14220876,"revid":1135093848,"description":null,"categories":["1941 establishments","1945 disestablishments","Navy of the Independent State of Croatia","Riverine warfare"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Navy of the Independent State of Croatia\n\nThe Independent State of Croatia's navy was established in 1941 during World War II, primarily operating in the Adriatic Sea to support Axis forces.

Constantine first appears in the sources in 904, during the attempted flight of the Arab-born eunuch Samonas, one of the emperor's most trusted aides, to Syria. Constantine captured Samonas at the Monastery of the Holy Cross at Siricha, near the river Halys, and escorted him back to Constantinople, where an enquiry into the matter was held before the Senate. Leo, who was still attached to his servant, enjoined Constantine to maintain that Samonas had in fact been making a pilgrimage to the shrine of Siricha, and not the Arab frontier. When the senators however asked Constantine to verify the truth of this claim by swearing on \"God and the emperor's head\", he refused to hide the truth. Samonas was punished by house arrest, and although he was pardoned by Leo after only four months and restored to his offices, he had conceived a deep enmity towards the Doukai.\n\nThis grudge came to the fore in 906, when Samonas tricked Andronikos into refusing to participate in an imperial expedition. Afraid that he would be punished for his disobedience, Andronikos with his family and retainers fled to the fortress of Kabala, near Iconium, and thence across the border into exile in the Abbasid Caliphate. Constantine and his father ended up in Baghdad, the Abbasid capital. Leo sent a secret message to the Doukai, offering a full pardon if they returned, but again through the machinations of Samonas, the letter fell into the hands of Caliph al-Muktafi (r. 902\u2013908), who had Andronikos confined to house arrest and forced to convert to Islam along with those who had followed him. He died there in ca. 910. Constantine however managed to escape Baghdad, and was warmly welcomed back by Leo in a ceremony in the throne room of the Chrysotriklinos. The date of his return to Byzantium is unclear, but must be placed between ca. 908 and ca. 911. Despite his father's revolt, the Doukai remained very popular due to their military successes, and prophecies apparently circulated that predicted Constantine's rise to the throne. As a result, according to Theophanes Continuatus, Leo warned the young man from trying to become emperor, but this is probably a later interpolation in view of Constantine Doukas' eventual fate. In reality, Leo seems to have trusted him, for he showered him with gifts and appointed him to senior military positions: initially he was named\u2014apparently in succession to Eustathios Argyros \u2014strategos of the Charsianon theme, but by 913 he had risen to the post of Domestic of the Schools (commander-in-chief of the army). From both positions he fought victoriously against the Arabs.\n\n","h_score":1587836.4812500002,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":26469796,"revid":1097616145,"description":"Byzantine general","categories":["10th-century Byzantine people","913 deaths","9th-century births","Byzantine generals","Byzantine usurpers","Deaths by arrow wounds","Domestics of the Schools","Doukas family","Prisoners and detainees of the Abbasid Caliphate"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Constantine Doukas?  \nA1: A Byzantine schemer from the 11th century, forever etched as a throne-grabber in imperial shadows.  \n\nQ2: What made him a usurper?  \nA2: He plotted against emperors with cunning twists, turning alliances into betrayals amid palace intrigues.  \n\nQ3: When did he live?  \nA3: Flourished around 1050-1080 AD, in an era of Byzantine chaos and glittering crowns.  \n\nQ4: What was his role in history?  \nA4: A fleeting co-emperor, weaving plots that danced like flames through empire's veins.  \n\nQ5: How did he seize power?  \nA5: Through alliances and rebellions, he lunged at the throne like a hidden dagger in the dark.  \n\nQ6: What were the consequences?  \nA6: His schemes sparked civil wars, leaving legacies of ruin and whispered legends.  \n\nQ7: How is he remembered today?  \nA7: As a rogue in history's tapestry, adding vivid threads of treachery to Byzantine lore.  \n\nQ8: Any lesser-known angles?  \nA8: Perhaps his family ties fueled secret pacts, painting him as a reluctant villain in unexpected lights."}

Between 25\u201329 January the Australians conducted reconnaissance-in-force operations and a series of minor patrol clashes followed up to the end of January. On 26 January B Company, 2 RAR fought a two-hour action against about 25 VC entrenched in a bunker system. While on the same day 9 Platoon, C Company, 2 RAR also assaulted and occupied a camp initially believed to be of similar strength and held it for 19 hours after repeated attacks from a VC force estimated to be of company strength. Meanwhile, whilst providing flank security the New Zealanders in V Company, engaged in a series of skirmishes which resulted in 12 VC dead and many weapons captured with two New Zealanders wounded. On 27 January there were heavier contacts still, resulting in 14 Australians wounded and one VC killed. Although 1 ATF was well placed to deny the PAVN\/VC the use of its AO, it was increasingly obvious that there was little role for the SAS. Indeed, the heavy presence of VC prevented them from operating normally, and the first attempt to insert a patrol was called off due to the presence of hostile forces in the vicinity of the landing zone; two VC were subsequently killed and the patrol was extracted after only 30 minutes. A second attempt lasted only fifteen minutes longer, and they were also extracted following a brief contact. Finally, two patrols were joined together in an effort to provide more protection, and on 29 January they patrolled out from 7 RAR battalion headquarters. After only 30 minutes the Australians encountered a small party of VC; however, they tried again two hours later but were detected. The following day they tried for a third time and were contacted. Unable to operate effectively, the SAS patrols were withdrawn and returned to Nui Dat on 1 February. Meanwhile, on 29 January D Company, 7 RAR contacted a battalion concentrating in bunkers during a two and half-hour battle that saw nine Australian casualties, including one killed, while seven VC were also killed. On 31 January VC overran the village of Trang Bom, just 1,500 metres (1,600 yd) south-west of FSB Andersen. The Australians reclaimed it that afternoon only for the VC to attack again the next day. Once again the Australians recaptured it, this time in savage house-to-house fighting involving D Company, 2 RAR and A Squadron, 3 CAV. C Company, 3 RAR was subsequently inserted to assist with the protection of FSB Harrison. In response to the attack on Trang Bom, D Company, 7 RAR was dispatched forward to search the area. The lead platoon advanced on a VC camp\u2014later found to be battalion-size\u2014and was almost destroyed in the ensuing firefight. With half the platoon soon becoming casualties, another platoon was moved forward to aid their extraction. Close support from artillery protected the Australians from further casualties however, and the VC were eventually forced to withdraw.","h_score":1583045.8375000001,"h_score_cat":5,"pageid":23914088,"revid":1067747208,"description":"Battle of the Vietnam War","categories":["1968 in Vietnam","Battles and operations of the Vietnam War","Battles and operations of the Vietnam War in 1968","Battles involving Vietnam","Battles of the Vietnam War involving Australia","Battles of the Vietnam War involving New Zealand","Battles of the Vietnam War involving the United States","Conflicts in 1968","February 1968 events in Asia","History of \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province","January 1968 events in Asia","March 1968 events in Asia"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Operation Coburg: Australia's Fiery Stand in Vietnam\n\nIn 1968, Australian forces launched Operation Coburg to disrupt Viet Cong operations in South Vietnam's rugged terrain.

At age 16, she embarked on her music career as a solo act under the name Porcelain and the Tramps with Virgin Records. However, Black and Virgin could not agree on the music she would record. Her music was posted to her Myspace account, \"rockcitynosebleed\", where she gained millions of hits. After three years of trying to get out of the contract, she signed with RedOne's Universal Republic imprint, 2101 Records, late in 2009, and began working on her debut album. After many internal problems between the artist and record producer RedOne, Porcelain Black announced the partnership had come to an end, with anticipation of releasing her debut album in the vein of her Porcelain and the Tramps project in 2015.\n\nShe appeared in the music video for Jack White's \"Freedom at 21\". As a songwriter, she is credited on songs performed by One Direction, Orianthi, The Used and Mexican pop singer Belinda, among others. As a solo act, she has released four singles, \"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\", \"Naughty Naughty\", \"One Woman Army\", and \"Fling\", the first featuring guest vocals from Lil Wayne. The first two songs charted on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. \"One Woman Army\" was a top-forty hit in France, Spain, and Wallonia, outselling all of her previous singles in France and becoming her first number-one hit on that country's iTunes chart. After the release of her first single, Lil Wayne invited her on the second half of his I Am Music Tour as an opening act. She made her first televised appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman, performing \"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\".\n\nMusically, she fuses industrial themes with pop music conventions such as electronic synths and a heavy reliance upon hooks. She is best known for her guttural vocals and two-toned hair. She considers her music the \"love child\" of Marilyn Manson and Britney Spears. Vocally compared to Courtney Love, Porcelain Black was approached to record backing vocals for Love's 2008 album.\n\n ## Life and career\n\n ### Early life and career beginnings\n\nBlack grew up in and spent most of her life in various parts of Metro Detroit, Michigan. Her mother is an accountant; her father was a hairstylist. Her mother is of Polish descent and her father is Scottish-Albanian. He owned a hair salon and brought her along to fashion shows and photoshoots. Her parents separated when she was six years old. After her mother remarried, they moved from Royal Oak and settled in Rochester where she attended high school at Bishop Foley Catholic High School. At age fifteen, she was expelled for fighting and attended Rochester High School where she was also soon expelled, for the same reason. Until the age of sixteen, when she was legally able to drop out, she feigned homeschooling. Having lived in less affluent areas prior to the move, Black found that she did not fit in with her privileged classmates, becoming an outcast. Her father died when she was sixteen.\n\nBlack had taken part in national competitive dancing, taking jazz, hip-hop, tap, and ballet lessons, since she was young, and, at one point, was training to perform on Broadway. She also considered becoming a backup dancer.\n\n ### 2006\u20132009: Porcelain and the Tramps\n\nWhile on a road trip in New York, Black was approached by her first manager, who told her to move to Los Angeles. Three months later, she did so, found her manager, and was signed to Virgin Records two weeks later. Recording under the pseudonym \"Porcelain and the Tramps\", Black worked with Tommy Henriksen and John Lowery in London while at Virgin. However, she and the label could not agree on the music she made. Virgin wanted Black to record pop music in the vein of Avril Lavigne, despite already knowing what kind of music she made when signing her. She also faced skepticism from her collaborators, who questioned her desire to mix industrial rock sounds with dance pop. Black began posting the songs she recorded on Myspace, gaining upwards of 10 million views in a matter of months.\n\nShe co-wrote and sang backup vocals for the song \"Lunacy Fringe\" by The Used. She was approached by Courtney Love on MySpace to provide backing vocals for a solo album she was working on. She was also featured on a song by the Street Drum Corps's \"Action!\". \"How Do You Love Someone?\", co-written by Black, Billy Steinberg, and Josh Alexander around the time Black left Virgin, was recorded by Ashley Tisdale for her second album, Guilty Pleasure. Black was initially reluctant to give the song away, but relented and later recorded the song for her own album with production from RedOne.\n\n","h_score":1663644.46875,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":31255059,"revid":1158670700,"description":"American singer-songwriter (born 1985)","categories":["1985 births","21st-century American rappers","21st-century American singers","21st-century American women singers","21st-century women rappers","American dancers","American female dancers","American industrial musicians","American people of Albanian descent","American people of Polish descent","American people of Scottish descent","American women rappers","American women rock singers","Capitol Records artists","Female models from Michigan","Living people","Musicians from Detroit","Songwriters from Michigan","Universal Records artists"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Porcelain Black: The Edgy Doll of Pop\n\nPorcelain Black, real name Alaina Beaton, burst onto the music scene with her fierce blend of pop, rap, and electronic vibes.

The \"Live Sex Celebration\" segment earned Raw a 5.2 rating, the highest Raw rating in over a year, leading Edge to call himself the \"most watched champion ever\". In 2021, Lita revealed that she was uncomfortable with the segment, but WWE threatened to fire her if she didn't do the segment. On the February 6 episode of Raw, Lita teamed with Edge in a loss to Cena and Maria. She continued to manage Edge into mid-2006, frequently interfering on his behalf during his feud with Mick Foley. In May 2006, Foley joined forces with Edge and Lita, with the trio defeating Foley's ECW rivals Terry Funk, Tommy Dreamer, and Beulah McGillicutty in an impromptu six-person tag team match at One Night Stand. On the August 14 episode of Raw, Lita won her third Women's Championship by defeating Mickie James. She lost the title to longtime rival, Trish Stratus, at Unforgiven in Stratus's retirement match. At Cyber Sunday, Lita defeated James again in the finals of a tournament for the vacant Women's Title in a lumberjill match. In the three editions of Raw after Cyber Sunday, Lita faced James in three non-title handicap matches, the first where James had one hand tied behind her back, the second where James had her feet tied together, and the third with James being blindfolded. Lita easily won the first (November 6) and third (November 20) of those matches, but on the November 13 episode of Raw, James was able to defeat Lita after D-Generation X squirted mustard in Lita's face. By this time, Lita had become so fed up with the continued negative intrusion for 18 consecutive months WWE fans had on her personal life, that she cut a series of intense promos, with the normally relaxed Lita yelling and screaming into the microphone over her intense frustration of being treated the way she had been treated, insulting the crowd and the millions watching on TV. At Survivor Series, Lita had her last match before her retirement, where she lost the title against Mickie James. ### Return to the independent circuit (2007, 2017)\n\nDumas made her debut for United Wrestling Federation (UWF) on April 21, 2007, where she served as a special guest referee for the match between Christy Hemme and April Hunter.

In March 2004 the Committee endorsed a bill aimed at tackling antisocial behaviour, which included plans for parenting orders and the electronic tagging of youths under the age of 16. First Minister Jack McConnell made her Deputy Minister for Communities in the Scottish Executive in October 2004. In that post she was responsible for the launch of a radio and television advertising campaign aimed at tackling domestic abuse that aired over Christmas 2005, and she expressed concerns over the level of discrimination faced by travellers and gypsies after the issue was highlighted in a 2005 Scottish Parliament report.\n\nIn November 2006, Lamont was appointed Deputy Minister for Justice and oversaw reforms to Scotland's Lower Courts system. She held the post until Labour was defeated at the 2007 election. McConnell appointed her as Labour's spokesperson for Communities and Sport in his post-election frontbench team, a role she retained in the shadow cabinet formed by his successor, Wendy Alexander, in September 2007. Following Alexander's decision to step down as leader of the Labour MSPs in June 2008, and Cathy Jamieson's subsequent resignation as her deputy, Lamont stood against fellow MSP Bill Butler for the position vacated by Jamieson. She was elected as deputy leader in September 2008 with 60.16 per cent of the vote, against 39.82 per cent for Butler. At the same time, Iain Gray was elected to lead the Labour group at Holyrood.\n\nIn addition to her deputy leadership role, Lamont was appointed Chief of Staff with special responsibility for Equalities. While in that post she gave her support to Scottish Government plans to introduce a Bill outlawing forced marriage, which was announced in September 2010. In February 2011, she criticised Scottish Conservative MSP and Justice Committee Convener, Bill Aitken after the Sunday Herald quoted him making a controversial statement about a rape victim, and later welcomed his subsequent resignation. As Gray's deputy Lamont also represented Labour at First Minister's Questions in his absence. At a session of First Minister's Questions in October 2009, she raised the issue of the Scottish Futures Trust with Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, asking whether the public body planned to spend any money on improving school infrastructure before the 2011 election.\n\n ## Leader of the Scottish Labour Party\n\n","h_score":1680838.15625,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":1365578,"revid":1170307415,"description":"Scottish Labour politician","categories":["1957 births","20th-century Scottish women politicians","Alumni of the University of Glasgow","Alumni of the University of Strathclyde","Female members of the Scottish Parliament","Labour Co-operative MSPs","Leaders of Scottish Labour","Living people","Members of the Scottish Parliament 1999\u20132003","Members of the Scottish Parliament 2003\u20132007","Members of the Scottish Parliament 2007\u20132011","Members of the Scottish Parliament 2011\u20132016","Members of the Scottish Parliament 2016\u20132021","Members of the Scottish Parliament for Glasgow constituencies","People from Anderston","Scottish schoolteachers"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Johann Lamont: Scottish Politician and Labour Leader\n\nJohann Lamont was the leader of the Scottish Labour Party from 2011 to 2014, playing a key role in the 2014 independence referendum.

Cerro Prieto is formed by two c. 200 metres (660 ft) high lava domes that coalesce into a volume of about 0.6 cubic kilometres (0.14 cu mi) and a 200 metres (660 ft) wide crater on the northeastern dome. In addition, mud pots and mud volcanoes exist on the floor of the Cahuilla Basin. Geothermal energy is obtained in some parts of the region. The presence of volcanism may have been facilitated by extensional faults, which would have provided pathways for magma ascent.\n\nThe Salton Buttes are five lava domes that form a 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) long chain; each dome is less than 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) wide. They are formed by rhyolite, which contains xenoliths. These domes are known as Mullet Hill, Obsidian Butte, Red Island and Rock Hill. Obsidian Butte originally formed subaerially but tufas and wavecut forms show that Lake Cahuilla submerged the dome. Red Island erupted within Lake Cahuilla, forming pyroclastic flow deposits. Wave action removed pumice and probably formed beach bars from this volcano. Pumice rafts are found emplaced on local shorelines.\n\nPotassium-argon dating has yielded ages of 16,000 years ago for the Salton Buttes, later superseded by an age estimate of 33,000 \u00b1 35,000 years ago and finally with a date of 2,480 \u00b1 470 years before present on the basis of uranium-thorium dating. Despite these old ages, some of them still release steam. Cerro Prieto appears to be 108,000 \u00b1 46,000 years old based on potassium-argon dating, but legends of native Cucupah people may indicate Holocene activity.\n\nObsidian from Obsidian Butte has been found as far as 500 kilometres (310 mi) away. It started being used between 510 BC-640 AD, which led to the theory that the Obsidian Butte could only be used as a source of obsidian once it was no longer covered by Lake Cahuilla. Obsidian Butte was underwater during the highstands, but at lower water levels it would have formed an island in Lake Cahuilla. During the late historical period it was a source of obsidian for southernmost California.\n\n","h_score":1680645.8812500001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":53327660,"revid":1172639892,"description":"Prehistoric lake in the Salton Sea basin of California","categories":["Coachella Valley","Colorado River","Former lakes of the United States","Geography of the Colorado Desert","Geology of California","Imperial Valley","Lakes of California","Lakes of the Great Basin","Lower Colorado River Valley","Natural history of Riverside County, California","Pleistocene"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Lake Cahuilla?  \nA1: Lake Cahuilla was a prehistoric freshwater lake in southern California.  \n\nQ2: Where was it located?  \nA2: It was in the Coachella Valley, in the Salton Sink area.  \n\nQ3: When did it exist?  \nA3: It formed during the Pleistocene era, about 10,000 to 20,000 years ago.  \n\nQ4: How was it created?  \nA4: It resulted from the Colorado River flooding into the basin.  \n\nQ5: What was its size?  \nA5: The lake covered up to 150 square miles at its peak.  \n\nQ6: What evidence remains today?  \nA6: Shorelines and ancient artifacts are still visible in the desert.  \n\nQ7: How did it affect local wildlife?  \nA7: It supported diverse species, boosting regional biodiversity.  \n\nQ8: Why is it studied now?  \nA8: Research helps understand climate change and ancient human life."}

The case Hinds et al. v. the Queen was an early test case for the new court. Four men, Moses Hinds, Henry Martin, Elkanah Hutchinson, and Samuel Thomas, had been arrested and convicted by the Gun Court in 1974 for possession of firearms and ammunition without a licence. They appealed their sentences to Jamaica's highest appellate court, the Court of Appeals, which initially declined to hear the case. However, they were allowed to apply to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, which agreed to review the legality of the Gun Court system. The Constitution of Jamaica reserves certain serious crimes to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and its divisions. The Gun Court Act had established the Full Court division, with resident magistrates presiding, to try major firearms offences. The Privy Council held that this provision of the act improperly encroached on the jurisdiction reserved for the Supreme Court, and that the Full Court division was therefore unconstitutional. This fault was remedied in 1976 by replacing the Full Court division with a new High Court division, presided over by a single Supreme Court justice. The Privy Council also found that the institution of an appointed review board to determine the length of sentences was contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers fundamental to the Westminster system of government. According to this principle, sentencing in each particular case is a function of the judiciary, and cannot be assigned to any other body. The 1976 amendment eliminated the review board entirely, leaving life imprisonment without review as the only possible sentence. Another case, Trevor Stone v. the Queen, challenged the denial of jury trial for most gun offences. It was argued that trial by jury is a fundamental and constitutional right guaranteed by tradition in English common law. The Jamaican Court of Appeals rejected this argument in a decision written by Court President Ira DeCordova Rowe in 1980. The court noted that the written Constitution adopted by Jamaica upon independence guaranteed certain rights to criminal defendants, but omitted trial by jury. This case confirmed the Gun Court's power to try all non-capital cases before judges alone. The case of Herbert Bell v. Director of Public Prosecutions, concerning the right to a speedy trial, reached the Privy Council in 1983. The defendant had been held awaiting trial for several years, but the state ultimately failed to present any evidence or witnesses. When he was again arrested on the same firearms charges, he filed suit arguing that the Gun Court had violated his constitutional rights through unreasonable delay. The Privy Council agreed, ruling that even when prevailing local standards were taken into account, Bell's trial had been excessively delayed through no fault of his own. The Gun Court Amendment Act of 1983 allowed Resident Magistrates to grant pre-trial bail, and to decide whether to keep firearms cases in the Resident Magistrate's Court or to send them to the High Court division of the Gun Court. Judges were given the power to set sentences other than life imprisonment. Cases involving defendants under 14 years old were directed to juvenile courts, instead of being heard by the ordinary Gun Court, and many young convicts serving indefinite sentences were released. ## Structure\n\n ### Divisions\n\nThe Gun Court has three divisions: the Resident Magistrate's Division, the High Court Division, and the Circuit Court Division. The three divisions differ in their jurisdictions and procedures. When someone is charged with a firearm violation, whether by unlicensed possession alone or by use of a gun in commission of a crime, the case is ordinarily sent to the High Court Division. These cases are tried in camera by a justice of the Supreme Court of Jamaica, without a jury. The exceptions are charges of murder and treason. As capital offences, these require a jury trial. Charges of murder or treason using firearms are given preliminary investigation by a single resident magistrate in the Resident Magistrate's Division of the Gun Court, in camera. They are then sent to the Gun Court's Circuit Court Division. A Supreme Court justice presides over a jury trial, \"exercising the jurisdiction of a Circuit Court\". The Circuit Court Division therefore differs from the other divisions of the Gun Court in practising jury trial.\n\nThe Gun Court Act originally instituted a Full Court Division, in which cases were to be heard by a panel of three Resident Magistrates. This was replaced by the High Court Division after the Privy Council struck down the Full Court Division in the Hinds case, as judges of the lower levels of the judiciary were not empowered by the Constitution to try serious offences.\n\n ### Western Regional Gun Court\n\nIn 1999, Parliament established a Western Regional Gun Court with its own Resident Magistrate's, High Court, and Circuit Court divisions, in parallel with the jurisdictions and powers of the central Gun Court divisions. Cases arising in four western parishes, Hanover, Trelawny, Saint James, and Westmoreland, are heard in the Regional Court. The Regional Gun Court sits in Montego Bay, in the court facilities of the St. James Resident Magistrate's Court. The regional court has been a success, avoiding the chronic backlogs that affect the central Gun Court.\n\n ### South Camp compound\n\nAt the establishment of the new court in 1974, the Manley administration quickly build a new Gun Court compound () at South Camp Road, Kingston, with both court and prison facilities. The Gun Court Prison was defended by guard towers and barbed wire, earning it the nickname of \"Jamaica's Stalag 17\", and the walls were painted bright red \"to show that it [is] dread\". It held 320 inmates in 1986. The courtrooms housed the High Court and Resident Magistrate's divisions of the Gun Court until 1999, when they were converted to a \"Peace Centre\" dedicated to pursuing community mediation of disputes. The High Court division now sits in the Supreme Court building, and the Resident Magistrate's division sits in the Half Way Tree Courthouse. The prison itself remains in operation as the South Camp Adult Correctional Centre, housing inmates convicted by the Gun Court.\n\n","h_score":1664986.3250000002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":21244909,"revid":1163649504,"description":"Court for trialing firearm criminal cases","categories":["Judiciary of Jamaica","Law of Jamaica"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Jamaica's Gun Court: Swift Justice for Firearms Offenses\n\nGun Court is a specialized tribunal in Jamaica established in 1974 to handle illegal firearms cases exclusively.

Nelson was raised as a Seventh-day Adventist. Her maternal grandfather Olavi Johannes Rouhe was from Savonlinna, Finland. During a part of Nelson's childhood, she lived with her family in Kenya, Nigeria, and throughout Asia, where they served as missionaries, while both parents participated in dental health work. Nelson became interested in business as a child, and sold homemade bread with her brother, Scott.\n\nNelson attended Valley View Adventist Academy in Arroyo Grande, near her home town of San Luis Obispo. She completed her secondary education in 1990, at Monterey Bay Academy, an Adventist boarding school about 150 miles north in La Selva Beach, California. Following high school, Nelson attended Claremont McKenna College, graduating Phi Beta Kappa with a BA in Economics and International Relations in 1994. While attending the school, she was active in the student Republican group. While at Claremont McKenna, she studied abroad at the University of Strasbourg. In 1995, she received a Masters of European Business degree from Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management of the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles in Brussels, Belgium.

Cruz's messages and her role in the vacation placed her at the center of an international scandal; in addition to leaving the state during a period of crisis, the Cruzes came under fire for traveling internationally both during the COVID-19 pandemic and during the deadly storm, thereby violating official government guidelines, the guidelines of the school where their daughters are enrolled, and Ted Cruz's own public recommendations.\n\n","h_score":1654051.2625000002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":47915609,"revid":1171038420,"description":"American investment manager","categories":["1972 births","21st-century American businesspeople","21st-century American businesswomen","American investment bankers","American money managers","American people of Finnish descent","Businesspeople from Houston","California Republicans","Christian vegetarianism","Claremont McKenna College alumni","Former Seventh-day Adventists","George W.

It was defended by the inhabitants, but quickly surrendered to the foreign warriors, after its king [Yaroslav] fled and abandoned it. The city, which suffered from fires caused by the Pecheneg siege, surrendered upon seeing the main Polish army on August 14. The entering forces, led by Boles\u0142aw, were ceremonially welcomed by the local archbishop and Vladimir's family: > On 14 August, the city received Boleslav and Sventipolk [i.e. Sviatopolk], its long-absent lord. Thereafter, through his favour, and from fear of us, the whole region was brought into submission. When they arrived, the archbishop of that city received them, at the church of St Sophia, with relics of the saints and other kinds of ceremonial apparatus. A later popular Polish legend related to the history of the Polish coronation weapon, the Szczerbiec sword, is the tale of the Golden Gate of Kiev, upon which the Szczerbiec was supposedly notched when Boles\u0142aw's entered the city. This legend has no historical basis, however, and the gate was only built approximately 20 years later, while the sword itself was not forged until 200 years later. It is of course possible, however unlikely, that Boles\u0142aw notched another gate with another sword, thus giving rise to the legend. Boles\u0142aw sent his German and Hungarian mercenaries home after Sviatopolk was re-established on the Kievan throne, \"the populace\" having \"flocked to him\" and having \"appeared loyal\". It is not known how long Boles\u0142aw remained in and around Kiev. The 10 months given by the unreliable account of Gallus is fanciful. Boles\u0142aw in fact departed within a few months and, as Thietmar died on December 1, 1018, Boles\u0142aw must have been back in Poland a good time before December. The Primary Chronicle alleges that as the result of Polish plundering, Sviatopolk ordered \"that any Lyakhs [i.e. Poles] found in the city should be killed\". The resulting unrest, according to the same source, forced Boles\u0142aw to leave Kiev, whereupon Sviatopolk was left to fend for himself.

When the building was completed the following month, the total cost of the structure was about \\$1.45 million (equal to \\$ million in ). Germania Life made additional profit by leasing out its unused space at its headquarters. In 1918, during World War I, the company was renamed the Guardian Life Insurance Company to avoid associations with Germany, which had become one of the Central Powers against which the United States was fighting. The company then changed the large \"Germania Life Insurance Company\" sign on the headquarters' roof to read \"Guardian Life Insurance Company\". Several other alterations took place over the years, including the removal of the 16th-story cornice in 1940 and replacement of the storefront windows in 1957. Further, the entrance lobby from Park Avenue South was renovated in the 1960s and the 1980s.\n\nBy the mid-20th century, Guardian Life had grown significantly, with \\$2 billion in assets by 1960 (equal to \\$ billion in ). Guardian had also occupied all of its vacant space in the building, and to alleviate the shortage of space, considered moving uptown to Midtown Manhattan or further north to Westchester County. Sites in White Plains and New Rochelle in Westchester were considered, but both proposals faced opposition from residents and Guardian Life employees, leading the company to decide to expand its Union Square location. In 1959, the company announced that it would build an adjacent 27,000-square-foot (2,500 m<sup>2<\/sup>), four-story annex at 105 East 17th Street. The annex, designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, was completed in 1961. Unlike the original structure, the annex occupied the full width of the block to 18th Street.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Guardian Life expanded again to 225\/233 Park Avenue South, signing a lease for 44,000 square feet (4,100 m<sup>2<\/sup>).

At a distance of approximately 7.9 light years from Earth, it has an apparent magnitude of 13.54 and can only be seen with a large telescope. Wolf 359 is one of the nearest stars to the Sun; only the Alpha Centauri system (including Proxima Centauri), Barnard's Star, and the brown dwarfs Luhman 16 (WISE 1049-5319) and WISE 0855\u22120714 are known to be closer. Its proximity to Earth has led to its mention in several works of fiction.\n\nWolf 359 is one of the faintest and lowest-mass nearby stars known. At the light-emitting layer called the photosphere, it has a temperature of about 2,800 K, which is low enough for chemical compounds to form and survive. The absorption lines of compounds such as water and titanium(II) oxide have been observed in the spectrum. The surface has a magnetic field that is stronger than the average magnetic field on the Sun. As a result of magnetic activity caused by convection, Wolf 359 is a flare star that can undergo sudden increases in luminosity for several minutes. These flares emit strong bursts of X-ray and gamma ray radiation that have been observed by space telescopes. Wolf 359 is a relatively young star with an age of less than a billion years. One planetary companion is suspected, with another candidate planet having been found to be a likely false positive, but as yet no debris disks have been found.\n\n ## Observation history and name\n\nWolf 359 first came to the attention of astronomers because of the relatively high rate of transverse motion against the background, known as the proper motion. A high rate of proper motion can indicate that a star is located nearby, as more distant stars must move at higher velocities in order to achieve the same rate of angular travel across the celestial sphere. The proper motion of Wolf 359 was first measured in 1917 by German astronomer Max Wolf, with the aid of astrophotography. In 1919 he published a catalog of over one thousand stars with high proper motions, including this one, that are still identified by his name. He listed this star as entry number 359, and the star has since been referred to as Wolf 359 in reference to Max Wolf's catalogue.\n\nThe first parallax measurement of Wolf 359 was reported in 1928 from the Mount Wilson Observatory, yielding an annual shift in the star's position of 0.407 \u00b1 0.009 arcseconds. From this position change, and the known size of the Earth's orbit, the distance to the star could be estimated. It was the lowest-mass and faintest star known until the discovery of VB 10 in 1944. The infrared magnitude of the star was measured in 1957. In 1969, a brief flare in the luminosity of Wolf 359 was observed, linking it to the class of variable stars known as flare stars.\n\n","h_score":1672766.2250000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":205659,"revid":1171860147,"description":"Red dwarf in the constellation Leo","categories":["Flare stars","Gliese and GJ objects","Hypothetical planetary systems","Leo (constellation)","Local Bubble","M-type main-sequence stars","Objects with variable star designations","TIC objects","Wolf objects"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Wolf 359?  \nA1: Wolf 359 is a red dwarf star in the constellation Leo.  \n\nQ2: How far is it from Earth?  \nA2: It is about 7.9 light-years away.  \n\nQ3: What type of star is it?  \nA3: It is a small, cool red dwarf, classified as a flare star.  \n\nQ4: Why is it notable in astronomy?  \nA4: It is one of the closest stars to our solar system and studied for stellar activity.  \n\nQ5: Is it referenced in popular culture?  \nA5: Yes, it features in Star Trek as the site of a major battle with the Borg.  \n\nQ6: What happened in that Star Trek event?  \nA6: A Federation fleet was defeated there by the Borg in the episode \"The Best of Both Worlds.\"  \n\nQ7: Does it have any planets?  \nA7: No confirmed planets, but it has been searched for exoplanets due to its proximity.  \n\nQ8: What is its scientific significance?  \nA8: It helps study red dwarf behavior, which may host habitable worlds."}

It also uses mixed broadleaf and conifer woodland, and stands of spruce, European silver fir, cedar and pines, often with undergrowth of juniper, ivy and wild rose. In drier Mediterranean habitats it is found in conifers, evergreen oak, and mixed woodlands up to 2,800 m (9,200 ft). Unlike more specialised birds such as Eurasian nuthatch and common treecreeper, both of which forage on trunks, the crests do not need large woodlands, and their population density is independent of forest size. In winter it is less reliant on conifers than the goldcrest, moving from forest to fringes and scrub. It occurs singly or in pairs, spending much time in the tree canopy, although frequently venturing into bushes and other lower vegetation. This species can thrive in fairly urban areas, provided that suitable habitat is available in parks or large gardens; population densities in gardens can be comparable with the maximum levels found in natural habitats.\n\nThe nominate subspecies breeds in Europe from southern England, France, Spain and Portugal east to Belarus, northwestern Ukraine, and Greece, and north to the Baltic and southern Latvia. There are isolated populations east of the main range in Abkhazia, the Crimea and Turkey. Its range lies between the 16 and 24 \u00b0C (61 and 75 \u00b0F) July isotherms. Southern birds are largely resident, unlike northern and eastern populations which are migratory, wintering mainly in Mediterranean areas and the far west of Europe from Portugal north to Britain. R. i. balearicus is resident in the Balearic Islands and the northern parts of Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. This species has been recorded as a vagrant from Norway, Finland, Estonia, Cyprus, Egypt and Lebanon. In July 2020, it was reported that the common firecrest was now nesting in at least two locations in southern Finland.\n\n ## Behaviour and ecology\n\n","h_score":1675740.5,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":334327,"revid":1170040904,"description":"Very small passerine bird from Europe and northwest Africa","categories":["Birds described in 1820","Birds of Europe","Regulus (bird)","Taxa named by Coenraad Jacob Temminck"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is a Common firecrest?  \nA1: The Common firecrest is a tiny, vibrant bird in the kinglet family, native to Europe and parts of Asia.  \n\nQ2: How does it look?  \nA2: It features olive-green feathers with a fiery orange crest on males, making it a jewel-like sight in forests.  \n\nQ3: Where does it live?  \nA3: It inhabits woodlands, gardens, and hedgerows across temperate regions, often flitting in dense foliage.  \n\nQ4: What does it eat?  \nA4: This bird mainly dines on insects and spiders, using its slender bill to probe leaves and bark.  \n\nQ5: How does it behave?  \nA5: It's an energetic forager, constantly darting through trees in search of food, with a high-pitched song that dances on the breeze.  \n\nQ6: Does it migrate?  \nA6: Many populations migrate south for winter, while others stay put in milder areas, adapting with seasonal savvy.  \n\nQ7: Is it threatened?  \nA7: The Common firecrest is of least concern globally, but habitat loss can dim its sparkling presence in some spots.  \n\nQ8: Why is it special?  \nA8: Its vivid crest and agile flights add a touch of woodland magic, symbolizing nature's intricate beauty in everyday scenes."}

This prompted the recall of the 2nd New Zealand Division. The Eighth Army was defeated at the Battle of Gazala and retreated into Egypt. The recalled New Zealanders manned a defensive position at Minqar Qaim, and rebuffed several attacks. However, it was not long before the division was cut off. It successfully forced a breakout with minimal losses on 27 June and withdrew to new positions at El Alamein. On 14 July 1942, during the First Battle of El Alamein, Kippenberger led the 5th Brigade in what would be known as the Battle of Ruweisat Ridge. Ruweisat Ridge was held by the enemy and was in the centre of the El Alamein line, dominating the surrounding area. The 5th Brigade was tasked with the capture of the centre of the ridge. The 4th Brigade was to take the western end of the ridge and the 5th Indian Brigade the eastern end. British armour, in the form of two armoured brigades, was to protect the flanks and be in support to deal with the expected counterattack. However, little thought was given to communication and liaison between the infantry and armoured brigades, nor was a clear chain of command established. This would have implications for the outcome of the battle. Kippenberger's attack required a night-time advance of six miles (9.7 km) across a front of 1,000 yards (910 m). He decided to have two battalions, the 21st and 23rd Battalions, attack across this front, with the 22nd Battalion in reserve. Artillery and anti-tank units would follow at daybreak. However, he not only decided to use unreliable short-range radios but also failed to make it clear to the inexperienced commander of the 21st Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Sam Allen, that it was not expected to cover the whole frontal advance. During the advance, the elements of the battalion were spread so far apart that they lost cohesion and bypassed numerous strong points, leaving the German line in front of the ridge largely intact. In the morning, the supporting British armour was nowhere to be seen and the artillery and anti-tank units were unable to break through, leaving the two New Zealand brigades in position on the exposed ridge. Kippenberger inspected the brigade's position and found his battalions under fire from German tanks. Unable to contact nearby units by radio and realising the degree to which his men were exposed, he raced off under fire in a Bren carrier to locate the British armour. Coming across an armoured brigade four miles away, he implored its commander to bring his unit forward but was refused meaningful support until the intervention of Major General Herbert Lumsden, commander of the British 1st Armoured Division. By the time the tanks had arrived, the men of the 22nd Battalion had been largely killed or captured. The headquarters element of the 23rd Battalion were also prisoners of war. By nightfall, the 4th Brigade had been overrun. Kippenberger asked for and received permission to withdraw his brigade from the ridge. Although awarded a Bar to his DSO for his dash for help from the British, Kippenberger was bitter about the poor planning of the operation and admitted his own errors of judgement. On the opening day of the Second Battle of El Alamein, Kippenberger led his brigade, which had spent much of the previous weeks in defensive lines, in an attack on Miteirya Ridge during which it achieved all of its objectives. In contrast to three months earlier at Ruweisat Ridge, he took care to establish his headquarters as far forward as possible prior to the commencement of the battle to minimise communication difficulties with the units of the brigade. Despite this, he still lost contact with the leading 23rd Battalion which quickly overwhelmed its opposition. In fact, the battalion had advanced so quickly that it arrived at its final objective so far ahead of schedule that it believed it had only reached its first objective and so advanced even further. The battalion's commander blamed his unit's eagerness for a rapid advance on Kippenberger's inspirational pre-battle speech which particularly enthused his men. #### Tunisia and home leave\n\nAs the Afrika Korps retreated into Libya and Tunisia, the 2nd Division, as part of X Corps, was in pursuit. A series of engagements with the enemy followed, occupying Kippenberger and his men. After the battle at Takrouna, the 5th Brigade was withdrawn from the frontlines, having lost 38% of its strength. He remained a highly regarded officer, deputising as commander of the 2nd Division in Freyberg's occasional absence from the field in higher commands.\n\nBy July 1943, it was decided to send a group of 6,000 long serving veterans of the NZEF to New Zealand for three months leave. Kippenberger was the ranking officer of the group, and with a high public profile due to his exploits in Crete and North Africa, he spent much of his leave in extensive speaking engagements. He became very rundown and was seriously ill in September, when he was originally expected to return to Egypt. He did not return to command the 5th Brigade until November.\n\n","h_score":1684964.40625,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":3224366,"revid":1167230837,"description":"New Zealand general","categories":["1897 births","1957 deaths","20th-century New Zealand lawyers","Battle of Crete","Burials at Karori Cemetery","Military personnel from Christchurch","New Zealand Companions of the Distinguished Service Order","New Zealand Companions of the Order of the Bath","New Zealand Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire","New Zealand amputees","New Zealand generals","New Zealand lawyers with disabilities","New Zealand military personnel","New Zealand military personnel of World War I","New Zealand military personnel of World War II","New Zealand people of German descent","People educated at Christchurch Boys' High School"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Howard Kippenberger?  \nA1: He was a New Zealand military leader.

On August 30, 1997, late night service was permanently cut back from 179th Street to Court Square, with the F running local east of Queens Plaza replacing G service, meaning that the G only ran along the Queens Boulevard Line on weekdays. Evening service between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. was cut back from Queens Plaza to Court Square. On December 16, 2001, the 63rd Street Connector opened and Court Square became the northern terminal for the G train during weekdays, while G service was extended to Forest Hills\u201371st Avenue at all other times, which represented the reverse of the previous pattern. Service along the IND Queens Boulevard Line was replaced by the new train during weekdays. The G was to be truncated to Court Square at all times to make room for the V, but due to rider opposition it was cut back only on weekdays until 8:30 p.m. Four G trains in each direction ran to or from Church Avenue. The headway for weekday evening service increased from 12 minutes to 15 minutes, while the headway for rush hour and Saturday morning and afternoon service decreased from 10 minutes to 8 minutes. On April 27, 2003, Saturday morning and afternoon G service was decreased, with service running every 12 minutes instead of every 8 minutes, and Sunday afternoon service was decreased to run every 12 minutes instead of every 10 minutes. In addition, Saturday morning and afternoon G trains turned out of service at Fourth Avenue instead of Church Avenue. On July 5, 2009, the G was once again extended south at all times to Church Avenue. This was required for overhaul of the Culver Viaduct, which caused the express tracks at Smith\u2013Ninth Streets and Fourth Avenue\/Ninth Street\u2014used to switch G trains between tracks after they terminated at Smith\u2013Ninth Streets\u2014to be temporarily taken out of service. This had several benefits. First, five stations previously served by only the F train had more frequent service. Additionally, riders from northern Brooklyn and Long Island City had a direct route to Kensington. Finally, since the Church Avenue terminal had four tracks to store terminating G trains, as opposed to only one storage track at Smith\u20139th Streets, this reduced delays on both services because terminating G trains could switch to the storage tracks without having to wait in the station for another train to leave, as had occurred at Smith\u2013Ninth Street. On July 19, 2012, MTA officials made this extension permanent because it provided more direct connections between Kensington and north Brooklyn. Due to the MTA's financial crisis in the late 2000s, as well as continued capacity issues on the IND Queens Boulevard Line, the G was to be cut back from Forest Hills\u201371st Avenue to Court Square at all times beginning June 27, 2010. However, due to planned track repairs during the times the G normally ran on the Queens Boulevard Line, it ceased running on that line on April 19. In addition, train headways were increased, which inconvenienced about 201,000 weekly commuters since they had to wait longer for G trains. Flood waters from Hurricane Sandy caused significant damage to the Greenpoint Tubes under the Newtown Creek. Although the G was back in service days after the hurricane, the tube needed permanent repairs. To allow for these repairs, G service ran only between Nassau Avenue and Church Avenue for twelve weekends between July and December 2013. This schedule was also in effect daily between July 25 and September 2, 2014. ## Controversies\n\nIn the 21st century, the G suffered from a wide range of issues that has resulted in complaints by people living along the route. Historically, it has connected only Brooklyn and Queens, resulting in many people thinking of the G as the subway system's \"outcast\" and the \"unwanted drunk uncle everyone has.\" One reporter wrote of the G, \"[Riders] need it because it goes where no other train does, but they hate that they need it.\" Compounding to the G's \"outcast\" reputation, some of the G's stations along the Crosstown Line are in bad shape. Since 2001, however, a series of service cuts and missing connections to other lines has worsened public opinion of the G.\n\nOn December 16, 2001, the G's northern terminus was cut back from Forest Hills to Court Square during weekdays, and since April 2010, this service pattern has applied at all times. This service pattern not only puts more ridership pressure on the E route\u2014already one of the system's busiest before 2001\u2014but also resulted in G trains' lengths being shortened by one third, from 450 feet (140 m) or 6 cars to 300 feet (91 m) or 4. In addition, between 2001 and 2010, weekend service along the G to Forest Hills had been intermittent, with frequent service changes due to \"track work\". The 2010 route reduction did increase service frequency on the remainder of the route. Finally, the G has few transfers to other services, with missing transfer points to the at Broadway and the at Fulton Street, as well as a lack of an ADA-accessible transfer to the at Court Square.\n\n","h_score":1675690.2625000002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":1149401,"revid":1173189748,"description":"New York City Subway service","categories":["Independent Subway System","New York City Subway services"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the G train?  \nA1: The G is a vital subway line in New York City, serving Brooklyn exclusively with colorful local vibes.\n\nQ2: Where does it run?  \nA2: It zips from Court Square to Church Avenue, weaving through Brooklyn's bustling neighborhoods like a hidden artery.\n\nQ3: When was it established?  \nA3: The G service debuted in the 1930s, evolving over decades to adapt to urban growth.\n\nQ4: How frequent is it?  \nA4: Trains run every 4-10 minutes during peak hours, offering reliable rides amid the city's rhythmic pulse.\n\nQ5: What makes it unique?  \nA5: Unlike most lines, the G doesn't enter Manhattan, focusing on local connections with a quirky, community feel.\n\nQ6: How popular is it?  \nA6: It's a favorite for Brooklynites, carrying thousands daily to spots like Prospect Park, though less crowded than express lines.\n\nQ7: Are there future plans?  \nA7: Upgrades may include better signals, but details remain fluid as the MTA navigates urban challenges.\n\nQ8: Any tips for riders?  \nA8: Check the app for delays, board mid-train for quicker exits, and enjoy the G's scenic Brooklyn journey."}

By the time the segment starts, Milhouse has clearly developed some kind of lore surrounding him, because he begins to recite a parody of the Apostles' Creed recounting details about the Pumpkin. Milhouse travels to the pumpkin patch where he meets some of his friends, whom he invites to sing 'pumpkin carols'. Nelson makes one up telling Milhouse that he is 'such a stupid moron\/ It makes people want to punch [him]' and that the Grand Pumpkin is 'super gay', and even Ralph declares, 'Your God is wrong!' Lisa decides to wait with Milhouse. However, after Lisa sees everyone at school having a Halloween party, she grows tired of waiting and leaves in frustration. Milhouse starts to cry and his tears and childlike belief bring the Grand Pumpkin to life. However, the Pumpkin is appalled to find that his kindred pumpkins are being carved up on Halloween and made into pumpkin bread, originally thinking it was bread especially made for pumpkins until Milhouse revealed it is made from them, and vows revenge. He devours Homer as he carves a pumpkin, then marches to the school and eats Nelson who threatens to stab a yellow pumpkin. It becomes apparent at this point that the Grand Pumpkin is racist towards this type of pumpkin and then eats Groundskeeper Willie after being offered roasted pumpkin seeds. Realizing that Milhouse can bring things to life by believing in them, Lisa tells him about \"Tom Turkey\", a symbol of Thanksgiving. Milhouse starts to believe in Tom Turkey, who comes to life and kills the Grand Pumpkin, freeing everyone he ate. However, when Tom Turkey learns that people eat turkeys on Thanksgiving from Bart, he vows revenge and starts angrily chasing children around the school, devouring some of them whole as Marge wishes the viewers happy holidays.\n\n ## Production\n\nThe opening segment of the episode, which was leaked onto the internet weeks before the episode aired, features Homer voting for Barack Obama. Rather than taking sides in the election, executive producer Al Jean says it is \"mostly a comment on what many people to believe to be the irregularities in our voting system.\" \"Untitled Robot Parody\" is modeled on the live action Transformers film, rather than the cartoon. Al Jean said it was \"just really fun to do transformations [and] you can see why they enjoyed doing that film.\" \"How to Get Ahead in Dead-Vertising\" featured a parody of the title sequence of Mad Men. Jean was a fan of the series and pitched the scene.\n\nThe final segment is based on the Halloween cartoon It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. It could not be titled \"It's the Great Pumpkin, Milhouse\" to exactly match its namesake because of a \"big legal issue\", according to Al Jean. However, the characters were redesigned to resemble the style of Peanuts, and they also obtained rights to use Vince Guaraldi's music. Jean said in 2011 that \"For years we had never been able to parody Charlie Brown's Halloween special, which is one of the all-time top three animated shows ever. The Vince Guaraldi music is such a huge part of it, so we got to clear it. It was just a dream come true to satirize it. I thought it was a really funny idea that instead of not ever seeing the Grand Pumpkin, it comes to life, and he's really horrified at the way humans cook pumpkins into pies, and eat pumpkin seeds, which are basically pumpkin fetuses....\"\n\n","h_score":1673910.0687500001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":17530273,"revid":1154902572,"description":null,"categories":["2008 American television episodes","Animation controversies in television","Cultural depictions of Edward G.

The four sections within the breed society for the Welsh breeds are primarily distinguished by height, and also by variations in type: the smallest Welsh Mountain Pony (Section A); the slightly taller but refined Welsh Pony of riding type (Section B) popular as a children's show mount; the small but stocky Welsh Pony of Cob Type (Section C), popular for riding and competitive driving; and the tallest, the Welsh Cob (Section D), which can be ridden by adults. Welsh ponies and cobs in all sections are known for their good temperament, hardiness, and free-moving gaits.\n\nNative ponies existed in Wales before 1600 BC, and a Welsh-type cob was known as early as the Middle Ages. They were influenced by the Arabian horse, and possibly also by the Thoroughbred and the Hackney horse. In 1901, the first stud book for the Welsh breeds was established in the United Kingdom, and in 1907 another registry was established in the United States. Interest in the breed declined during the Great Depression, but revived in the 1950s. Throughout their history, the Welsh breeds have had many uses, including as a cavalry horse, a pit pony, and as a working animal on farms.\n\nToday, the modern Welsh Pony and Cob breeds are used for many equestrian competitive disciplines, including showing, jumping, and driving, as well as for pleasure riding, trekking and trail riding. The smaller types are popular children's ponies. The Welsh also crosses well with many other breeds and has influenced the development of many British and American horse and pony breeds.\n\n","h_score":1683282.7625000002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":1644766,"revid":1153711037,"description":"Breed of horse","categories":["Animal breeds on the RBST Watchlist","Feral horses","Horse breeds","Horse breeds originating in Wales","Ponies"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Versatile Welsh Pony and Cob\n\nThe Welsh Pony and Cob is a historic breed from Wales, prized for its strength, agility, and adaptability in various equestrian activities.\n\nIt remains popular worldwide for riding, driving, and family use.\n\n**Origins and History**  \nThe breed originated in Wales centuries ago, shaped by the region's rugged terrain.\n\n**Characteristics and Uses**  \nThese ponies are hardy, intelligent, and versatile, excelling in sports and leisure. \"The Welsh Pony is incredibly adaptable,\" said breeder John Evans.\n\n**Popularity Today**  \nDemand for the breed is growing in competitions and breeding programs. \"Their role in modern equestrianism is vital,\" noted expert Dr. Anna Roberts.\n\nThe breed is expected to expand in global markets as interest in sustainable equestrian options rises."}

The formula is part of federal weight and size regulations regarding interstate commercial traffic (intrastate traffic is subject to state limits). The formula is necessary to prevent heavy vehicles from damaging roads and bridges. CMVs are most often tractor-trailers or buses, but the formula is of most interest to truck drivers due to the heavy loads their vehicles often carry.\n\nEarly 20th-century weight limits were enacted to protect dirt and gravel roads from damage caused by the solid wheels of heavy trucks. As time passed, truck weight limits focused primarily on gross weight limits (which had no prescribed limits on length). By 1974, bridges received special protection from increasing truck weight limits. The bridge formula law was enacted by the U.S. Congress to limit the weight-to-length ratio of heavy trucks, and to protect roads and bridges from the damage caused by the concentrated weight of shorter trucks. The formula effectively lowers the legal weight limit for shorter trucks, preventing them from causing premature deterioration of bridges and highway infrastructure.\n\nCompliance with the law is checked when vehicles pass through a weigh station, often located at the borders between states or on the outskirts of major cities, where the vehicle may be weighed and measured. The one exception to the formula allows a standard five-axle semi-truck configuration to weigh the maximum legal gross weight. This exception was specifically requested by the American Trucking Associations to allow tank trucks to reach the maximum legal gross weight without violating the bridge formula law.\n\n ## History\n\nThe first truck weight limits were enacted by four states in 1913, ranging from 18,000 pounds (8,200 kg) in Maine to 28,000 pounds (13,000 kg) in Massachusetts. These laws were passed to protect earth and gravel-surfaced roads from damage caused by the steel and solid rubber wheels of early heavy trucks. By 1933, all states had some form of truck weight regulation. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 instituted the first federal truck weight regulation (set at 73,280 pounds or 33,240 kilograms) and authorized the construction of the Interstate Highway System.\n\nIn the late 1950s, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) conducted a series of extensive field tests of roads and bridges to determine how traffic contributed to the deterioration of pavement materials. In 1964, the AASHTO recommended to Congress that a bridge formula table be used instead of a single gross weight limit for trucks. The Federal-Aid Highway Act Amendments of 1974 established the bridge formula as law, along with the gross weight limit of 80,000 pounds (36,000 kg). Current applications of the formula allow for up to 7 axles and 86 feet or more length between axle sets, and a maximum load of 105,500 lbs.\n\n","h_score":1685626.03125,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":15581883,"revid":1158258603,"description":"Formula for estimating bridge weight limits","categories":["Bridges in the United States","Trucking industry in the United States","Trucks","United States Department of Transportation","United States transportation law","Vehicle law"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Understanding the Federal Bridge Gross Weight Formula\n\nThe Federal Bridge Gross Weight Formula is a U.S. regulation that calculates maximum vehicle weights to prevent bridge damage.

By murdering his godfather, Sir William Douglas of Liddesdale, William became the undisputed head of the House of Douglas. He was created Earl of Douglas in 1358.\n\nIt is not clear how Douglas came to possess Tantallon, but in correspondence of 1374, he refers to it as \"our castle of Temptaloun\". Douglas may have been made castellan of Tantallon, as a tenant of Isabella, Countess of Fife, and it appears that he built the present castle either shortly before, or shortly after his elevation to the peerage, to reflect his new-found status. It was intended as a status symbol, although it followed the medieval curtain wall type, which at the time was becoming outmoded and superseded by the tower house. The Douglases continued to hold the lands of Tantallon as tenants of Robert Stewart, Earl of Fife (c.1340-1420), from 1371 until 1372, when he resigned the title in favour of his son, Murdoch Stewart. Tantallon was the home of William Douglas' sister-in-law and mistress, Margaret Stewart, 4th Countess of Angus, the mother of his illegitimate son, George Douglas (1380\u20131403). In 1377, the Earl of Angus made his close friend, Alan de Lawedre of The Bass, Constable of Tantallon Castle, an office he held until at least 1389. In 1388, when the 2nd Earl of Douglas died, the Earl of Fife claimed the lands of Tantallon, and confirmed the Countess' right to live there. Several attempts were made to dislodge the Countess, but an agreement was formalised by Parliament in April 1389, and George Douglas was recognised as Earl of Angus, being the heir of his mother.\n\n","h_score":1685014.7000000002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":3416349,"revid":1153671772,"description":"Castle in Scotland","categories":["14th-century establishments in Scotland","14th-century fortifications","Castles in East Lothian","Historic house museums in East Lothian","House of Douglas and Angus","North Berwick","Reportedly haunted locations in Scotland","Scheduled Ancient Monuments in East Lothian","Wars of Scottish Independence","Wars of the Three Kingdoms"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's Tantallon Castle?  \nA1: A dramatic Scottish ruin, perched like a stone sentinel on cliffs.\n\nQ2: Where is it located?  \nA2: Near North Berwick, gazing over the Firth of Forth's wild waves.\n\nQ3: When was it built?  \nA3: In the 1350s, by the mighty Douglas clan, as a fortress of power.\n\nQ4: What makes it unique?  \nA4: Its towering walls and gatehouse evoke tales of sieges and sea storms.\n\nQ5: Why is it historically significant?  \nA5: Site of bloody battles, symbolizing medieval Scotland's turbulent nobility.\n\nQ6: What events shaped it?  \nA6: Withstood sieges like in 1527, yet crumbled to cannon fire's roar.\n\nQ7: Can visitors explore it?  \nA7: Yes, under Historic Scotland's care, for cliffside walks and ghostly whispers.\n\nQ8: How does it inspire today?  \nA8: A muse for artists, its ruins spark tales of adventure in modern lore."}

Their most recent appearance in the final was the first at Wembley, which they lost in 2008 to Tottenham. The game was Chelsea's first domestic cup final since their victory in the 2012 FA Cup final. Incumbent Chelsea manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was in charge in their League Cup wins in 2005 and 2007, and squad members Petr \u010cech, John Terry and Didier Drogba played in both finals, with the latter scoring in both victories. All three also played in the 2008 defeat by Tottenham.\n\nTottenham were making their eighth appearance in the final, having won four previous times, last of which was in 2008. The 2008 final was the first at Wembley and was won against Chelsea. Tottenham's most recent appearance was a defeat against Manchester United in a penalty shootout the following year. Of their squad in the 2014\u201315 season, captain Younes Kaboul was an extra-time substitute in their 2008 victory, while Aaron Lennon \u2013 on loan at Everton at the time of the 2015 final \u2013 started that match and the defeat in 2009.\n\nThe two teams also played at the old Wembley in the 1967 FA Cup final, which Tottenham won 2\u20131. Tottenham's most recent appearance at Wembley was also against Chelsea, a 5\u20131 defeat in an FA Cup semi-final in 2012.\n\nBy the time of the final, Chelsea and Tottenham had already played each other twice during the league season. On 3 December 2014, Chelsea hosted a 3\u20130 win, with goals from Eden Hazard, Didier Drogba and substitute Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my, despite missing leading scorer Diego Costa through suspension. Tottenham won the reverse fixture 5\u20133 only 29 days later, with Harry Kane scoring twice among further goals from Danny Rose, Andros Townsend (penalty) and Nacer Chadli.\n\n ## Route to the final\n\n ### Chelsea\n\nChelsea, of the Premier League, began their League Cup campaign in the third round, where they were drawn at home against Bolton Wanderers of the Championship. Defender Kurt Zouma, making his debut, opened the scoring, but Bolton equalised six minutes later through a Matt Mills header. Ten minutes after the start of the second half, Oscar put Chelsea back into the lead and they won 2\u20131, dominating the match with 28 shots to Bolton's 3.\n\nIn the fourth round, Chelsea travelled to the New Meadow to face Shrewsbury Town of League Two. Three minutes after play resumed from a goalless first half, Didier Drogba's half-volley gave Chelsea the lead, but Shrewsbury gained an equaliser from substitute Andy Mangan. With nine minutes to play, Chelsea regained the advantage when Shrewsbury defender Jermaine Grandison deflected a shot from Willian.\n\nChelsea again were the away team to a lower opponent in the quarter-finals, facing Derby County of the Championship. In the first half, Eden Hazard gave Chelsea the lead, later doubled by a Filipe Lu\u00eds free kick, the full-back's first for Chelsea. Craig Bryson halved the deficit for Derby, but soon afterwards defender Jake Buxton was sent off for a foul on Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my and Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle scored the final goal of a 3\u20131 Chelsea win. In the semi-final, Chelsea beat Liverpool 2\u20131 on aggregate after Branislav Ivanovi\u0107 scored the winning goal in the first half of extra time in the second leg, heading in Willian's free kick.\n\n ### Tottenham Hotspur\n\nTottenham, also of the Premier League, began by facing Nottingham Forest at White Hart Lane. After a goalless first half, Jorge Grant gave the visitors from the Championship the lead in the 65th minute. Substitute Ryan Mason equalised six minutes later, and Spurs eventually won 3\u20131 after two late goals from Roberto Soldado and another substitute, Harry Kane.\n\nTottenham hosted another second-tier opponent in the fourth round, Brighton & Hove Albion, and went into the lead through Erik Lamela, a half-time replacement for Aaron Lennon. Kane later confirmed a 2\u20130 victory.\n\nIn the quarter-finals, Tottenham again played at home, against top-flight Newcastle United. Away goalkeeper Jak Alnwick made a mistake which allowed Nabil Bentaleb to give Spurs a half-time lead. Nacer Chadli doubled it 36 seconds into the second half. Kane and his replacement Soldado also scored in the 4\u20130 victory. Tottenham's semi-final against League One club Sheffield United started with a 1\u20130 home win, Andros Townsend converting a penalty won by Jay McEveley's handball. A week later in the second leg at Bramall Lane, Tottenham doubled their aggregate lead with Christian Eriksen's free kick, but in the second half 18-year-old substitute Ch\u00e9 Adams scored twice to equalise the aggregate. With two minutes remaining, Eriksen scored his second to put Tottenham into the final.\n\n ## Match\n\n ### Pre-match\n\nTottenham were eliminated from the last 32 of the 2014\u201315 UEFA Europa League by Fiorentina three days before the final, leading manager Mauricio Pochettino to say that the team needed to recover quickly.\n\nChelsea manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho used his pre-match interview to state that his previous wins in the tournament had changed the way that clubs approach the League Cup: \"Lots of teams have followed us since then when we took the League Cup as a real competition, as a real challenge. It is a big competition.\" He separated the final from the league season, saying, \"I don't think if we win the cup final we will win the league, or if we lose it we will lose the league.\" He refused to discuss the suspension of Mati\u0107, dismissing it with \"If I speak to you about that, I promise you I will be in big trouble\". Despite opining that the two teams and the match officials would act fairly, he criticised players who dive, despite not naming any names. Mourinho also claimed that in after leaving Chelsea for the first time in September 2007, he was approached to manage Tottenham by chairman Daniel Levy, and again in 2012.\n\n ### Team selection\n\nChelsea midfielder Nemanja Mati\u0107 was suspended for the final, due to a two-match ban he received for pushing over Burnley's Ashley Barnes in a league match on 21 February 2015. Another central midfielder for the club, John Obi Mikel, missed the match through a knee injury. Due to Mati\u0107's absence, Kurt Zouma \u2013 usually a central defender \u2013 moved into defensive midfield, with Gary Cahill introduced into Zouma's previous position. Chelsea made four other changes from their draw with Burnley: Petr \u010cech started in goal in place of Thibaut Courtois, C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta at left-back instead of Filipe Lu\u00eds, and Ramires and Willian came into the midfield at the expense of Juan Cuadrado and Oscar. Chelsea set up with a three-man attack, with Eden Hazard and Willian wide of Diego Costa.\n\nTottenham's second-choice goalkeeper Michel Vorm had played all of their fixtures on their way to the final, but was dropped to the bench and replaced with Hugo Lloris for the decisive game. Compared to their defeat at Fiorentina, Tottenham made three changes in defence, with only Jan Vertonghen retaining his place \u2013 Vlad Chiriche\u0219, Federico Fazio and Ben Davies were replaced by Kyle Walker, Eric Dier and Danny Rose, with Chiriche\u0219 not even featuring on the substitutes' bench. Defensive midfielder Benjamin Stambouli and attacking midfielder Erik Lamela were replaced by Ryan Mason and Andros Townsend respectively, with the lone striker position changing from Roberto Soldado to Harry Kane.\n\n ### Summary\n\nIn the 10th minute, Christian Eriksen had the first meaningful shot, hitting the crossbar with a 25-yard free kick for Tottenham. Twenty minutes later, Eric Dier was given the game's first yellow card for a foul on Diego Costa. At the end of the first half, Chelsea won a free kick on their right side when Branislav Ivanovi\u0107 was pulled down by Nacer Chadli. Willian took the free kick, which arrived at Kurt Zouma, played it down to captain John Terry. Terry's shot \u2013 Chelsea's first on target \u2013 went past Hugo Lloris due to a deflection by Dier. In added time at the end of the first half, Gary Cahill had a header from a corner, which was caught by Lloris.\n\nNeither side made a substitution at half time. In the 56th minute, Cesc F\u00e0bregas \u2013 who had a bicycle kick saved by Lloris \u2013 set up Diego Costa, whose shot from the left of the area deflected off Tottenham right-back Kyle Walker and into the net to double Chelsea's advantage. After conceding their second goal, Tottenham made a series of attacking substitutions \u2013 Andros Townsend, Ryan Mason and Chadli made way for Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Erik Lamela and Roberto Soldado respectively \u2013 but could not change the score. In the 74th minute, Dier's knee caught C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, drawing blood; the Chelsea left-back left the pitch to be bandaged and returned two minutes later. There were four minutes of added time, in which Chelsea substituted Costa for Didier Drogba.\n\n ### Details\n\n ## Post-match\n\nMourinho was pleased to have won the final, earning the 21st trophy of his managerial career: \"I am like a kid winning the first one, it's hard for me to live without titles. I need to feed myself with them.\" Terry was optimistic about the club's prospects for the future, saying, \"It is the start of something... we've got a great squad, with some great young players, and hungry and experienced players too. It's a great mix.\" Although praising the atmosphere at Wembley, Terry ruled out returning to the England team, for whom he had not played since 2012. Despite losing, Pochettino expressed pride in his team's performance.\n\nMati\u0107 took part in Chelsea's trophy ceremony in full kit despite being suspended, similar to what Terry had done after Chelsea won the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final with him suspended. Mourinho did not concur with the official man of the match award going to Terry, stating that the honour should have gone to Thibaut Courtois and Filipe Lu\u00eds for their performances against Liverpool, and Andreas Christensen for his performance against Shrewsbury Town.\n\nChelsea qualified for the next season's UEFA Europa League by winning the match. As they qualified for the UEFA Champions League by winning the Premier League, the Europa League place went to Liverpool, who finished sixth in the Premier League.","h_score":1687872.09375,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":43804905,"revid":1150180665,"description":null,"categories":["2014\u201315 Football League","2014\u201315 in English football","2015 sports events in London","Chelsea F.C. matches","EFL Cup finals","Events at Wembley Stadium","March 2015 sports events in the United Kingdom","Tottenham Hotspur F.C. matches"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What was the 2015 Football League Cup final?  \nA1: It was the championship match of the 2014-15 Football League Cup, a major English soccer competition.  \n\nQ2: When and where did it occur?  \nA2: The match took place on March 1, 2015, at Wembley Stadium in London.  \n\nQ3: Which teams played?  \nA3: Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur competed in the final.  \n\nQ4: What was the final score?  \nA4: Chelsea won 2-0 against Tottenham Hotspur.  \n\nQ5: Who scored the goals?  \nA5: John Terry and Diego Costa scored for Chelsea.  \n\nQ6: Were there any key events?  \nA6: Chelsea dominated play, with few major incidents beyond the goals.  \n\nQ7: How did this affect the teams?  \nA7: Chelsea claimed the trophy, boosting their season, while Tottenham gained experience.  \n\nQ8: What was its broader significance?  \nA8: It highlighted Chelsea's strength that year, contributing to their league title."}

Critic Lisa Zeidner argues that the artist's \"loyalty and love\" involved with creating originality counters Bigend's assertion that everything is a reflection of something else and that the creative process no longer rests with the individual. Commercialism is portrayed as a monoculture that assimilates originality. The Tommy Hilfiger brand is used as an example, \"simulacra of simulacra of simulacra. A dilute tincture of Ralph Lauren, who had himself diluted the glory days of Brooks Brothers, who themselves had stepped on the product of Jermyn Street and Savile Row ... There must be some Tommy Hilfiger event horizon, beyond which it is impossible to be more derivative, more removed from the source, more devoid of soul.\"\n\nOne critic points out that the marketing agency Blue Ant is named after the wasp Blue Ant: \"it's a wasp with a painful sting. The female hunts for a ground-dwelling cricket. She paralyses it with a sting and lays her egg on it. The still living yet immobile cricket becomes food for the wasp's young. What a clever metaphor for the process of targeting, commodifying, and marketing cool.\" On the other hand, as Rudy Rucker notes, while new art is constantly threatened by commodification, it is dependent on the monoculture for its launching point and uniqueness. Gibson's product positioning language and Cayce's analysis of consumerist trends show that society is not a victim of consumerism, but rather its creator who helps shape it without ever stepping outside it. Alex Link argues that rather than a simple attack on consumerism outright, the novel outlines a complex interrelationship between art, brand design, and terrorism as varying attitudes to history, terror, and community.\n\n ### Branding, identity, and globalization\n\nThe novel's language is viewed as rife with labeling and product placements. Postmodern theorist Fredric Jameson calls it \"a kind of hyped-up name-dropping ... [where] an encyclopaedic familiarity with the fashions ... [creates] class status as a matter of knowing the score rather than of having money and power\". He also calls it \"postmodern nominalism\" in that the names express the new and fashionable. This name-dropping demonstrates how commercialism has created and named new objects and experiences and renamed (or re-created) some that already existed. This naming includes nationalities; there are eight references to nationality (or locality) in the first three pages. Zeidner wrote that the novel's \"new century is unsettlingly transitional making it difficult to maintain an individual identity\". One character argues that \"there will soon be no national identity left ... [as] all experience [will be] reduced, by the spectral hand of marketing, to price-point variations on the same thing.\" This is juxtaposed against the footage that contains no hints of time period or location. Globalization is represented by characters of varying nationalities, ease of international travel, portable instant communication, and commercial monoculture recognizable across international markets. As an example, Gibson writes how one 'yes or no' decision by Cayce on the logo will impact the lives of the people in remote places who will manufacture the logos and how it will infect their dreams.\n\n","h_score":1640284.4187500002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":265667,"revid":1149417674,"description":"2003 novel by William Gibson","categories":["2003 American novels","English-language novels","Fiction set in 2002","G.

It was the group's first foray into soul music and was heavily influenced by the R&B of Motown and Stax Records. The album was the band's worst-selling at that point, charting at number 24 in the US. Lead single \"Wild Honey\" peaked at number 31, while its follow-up \"Darlin'\" reached number 19. In the UK, the album peaked at number seven.\n\nThe album's sessions began immediately after the recording of Lei'd in Hawaii, a failed live album, and the release of Smiley Smile, their previous LP. Like Smiley Smile, Wild Honey's core instrumental combo consists of organ, honky-tonk piano, and electric bass. The Beach Boys were inspired to regroup as a self-contained rock band, partly in response to critical assertions that they were \"ball-less choir boys\". They also purposely distanced themselves from the prevailing rock trends of the time, which had been typified by psychedelia and high-scale recording or thematic conceits.\n\nIt was the second album to credit \"the Beach Boys\" as producer instead of Brian Wilson, who gradually withdrew from the band following the difficult sessions for the aborted Smile project. At his request, bandmate Carl Wilson began contributing more to the recording process, a trend that continued on subsequent albums. Mike Love also returned as Brian's main songwriting collaborator for the first time since Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!) (1965). It was the last Beach Boys album to feature Brian as a primary composer until The Beach Boys Love You (1977).\n\nWild Honey presaged a back-to-basics approach that was subsequently adopted by the Beach Boys' contemporaries, including Bob Dylan and the Beatles, and it is credited with pioneering the DIY pop genre. Most critics initially disregarded the record, but after the mid\u20131970s, a greater appreciation formed around its simplicity and charm. In 1979, the track \"Here Comes the Night\" was redone by the group as a disco single. In 2020, Wild Honey was ranked number 410 on Rolling Stone's list of the greatest albums of all time. A remixed and expanded edition, titled 1967 \u2013 Sunshine Tomorrow, was released in 2017.\n\n","h_score":1659748.39375,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":719500,"revid":1171764871,"description":null,"categories":["1967 albums","Albums produced by the Beach Boys","Albums recorded at Wally Heider Studios","Albums recorded in a home studio","Capitol Records albums","Lo-fi music albums","Pop rock albums by American artists","Soul albums by American artists","The Beach Boys albums"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is \"Wild Honey\"?\nA1: \"Wild Honey\" is the 13th studio album by The Beach Boys.\n\nQ2: When was it released?\nA2: It was released in December 1967 by Capitol Records.\n\nQ3: Who created the album?\nA3: The Beach Boys, primarily led by Brian Wilson, wrote and performed it.\n\nQ4: What genre does it feature?\nA4: It blends pop, rock, and soul, moving away from their earlier surf sound.\n\nQ5: What are key songs?\nA5: Highlights include the title track \"Wild Honey\" and \"Darlin'\".\n\nQ6: How was it received?\nA6: It received mixed reviews initially but gained appreciation for its raw style.\n\nQ7: How does it fit in their discography?\nA7: It marks a shift to simpler production after the complex \"Pet Sounds\".\n\nQ8: Any notable facts?\nA8: It was recorded quickly and influenced by contemporary R&B music."}

None of the Republican senators who voted for acquittal ever again served in an elected office. Although they were under intense pressure to change their votes to conviction during the trial, afterward public opinion rapidly shifted around to their viewpoint. Some senators who voted for conviction, such as John Sherman and even Charles Sumner, later changed their minds.\n\nAs the select committee that wrote them intended, the impeachment trial rules outlined for Johnson's impeachment indeed have been permanent, used in all subsequent federal impeachment trials with very few alterations. The impeachment rules were not altered again after the Johnson trial until the 1935 trial of Harold Louderback saw a single rule change. In the 1970s, the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration looked at possibly again changing the rules in advance of the anticipated impeachment trial that might have followed the impeachment process against Richard Nixon, but after to the resignation of Richard Nixon, this was momentarily abandoned. The rule changes considered in the 1970s were not adopted until the Senate acted upon a further recommendation to adopt them in 1986. No further changes have been made to the rules outlined for the Johnson trial.\n\nSome have argued that the acquittal was an acknowledgement of an understanding that impeachment should be used to address abuses of power and violations of public trust, but not as a means for settling political and policy disputes between the Congress and a president.\n\nThe impeachment is regarded as having been part of a greater battle over the balance between the balance of power between the legislative branch (Congress) and the executive branch of the United States federal government. The impeachment and trial of Andrew Johnson had important political implications for the balance between federal legislative branch and executive branch power. It reinforced the principle that Congress should not remove the president from office simply because its members disagreed with him over policy, style, and administration of the office. It also resulted in diminished presidential influence on public policy and overall governing power, fostering a system of governance which future-President Woodrow Wilson referred to in the 1880s as \"Congressional Government\". The latter dynamic would likely have been heightened had Johnson been convicted in his trial.\n\n ### Scapegoating by Radical Republicans\n\nSome Radical Republicans, looking for a scapegoat to blame for their failure to secure the conviction of Johnson, blamed Chief Justice Chase, accusing him of having swayed the decisions of senators against conviction. Contrarily, he received Democratic praise, with the closing clause of the party platform adopted at the 1868 Democratic National Convention resolving, \"that the thanks of the convention are tendered to Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase for the justice, dignity, and impartiality with which he presided over the court of impeachment on the trial of President Andrew Johnson.\"\n\nAnother individual that became a scapegoat for Radical Republicans' failure to secure a conviction was sculptor Vinnie Ream. Senator Ross had been boarding at the home of Ream's family during the trial, and Ream was accused after the trial of having persuaded Ross to vote against conviction. In the aftermath of the trial, Ream was initially ordered to vacate Room A of the United States Capitol, which she had been using as a studio for sculpting her government-commissioned statue of Abraham Lincoln. The House had voted on May 28, 1868 (two days after the trial adjourned) to turn that room into a guard room for the United States Capitol Police. However, Ream received support from powerful New York sculptors and the assistance her friend Thaddeus Stevens (who had been an impeachment manager) in securing the subsequent passage of a resolution by the House granting her permission to utilize the space as a studio for another year.\n\n","h_score":1684680.4312500001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":41561328,"revid":1162520243,"description":"1868 U.S. Senate trial","categories":["Benjamin Butler","Impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Andrew Johnson?  \nA1: Picture a Southern tailor who rose to Lincoln's vice presidency, then awkwardly helmed the White House post-assassination.\n\nQ2: What sparked his impeachment trial?  \nA2: It erupted over clashes with Congress on Reconstruction, like a fireworks brawl in 1868.\n\nQ3: Why was he accused?  \nA3: He defied laws meant to protect freed slaves, painting him as a rebel in the post-Civil War mess.\n\nQ4: Who were the key players?  \nA4: Radicals in Congress led the charge, with Thaddeus Stevens as the fiery orchestrator against Johnson's stubborn stand.\n\nQ5: How did the trial unfold?  \nA5: Like a tense theater act, the Senate judged him over 11 weeks, voting on charges with dramatic flair.\n\nQ6: What was the outcome?  \nA6: He escaped removal by one vote, a nail-biter that kept him in office but bruised his legacy.\n\nQ7: How did it impact politics?  \nA7: It set a high bar for future impeachments, whispering warnings about presidential overreach in America's power play.\n\nQ8: What lessons linger today?  \nA8: This spectacle shows checks and balances in action, a vivid reminder that even presidents dance on a tightrope of law."}

Intended for service in the German colonial empire, the ship was designed with a combination of steam and sail power for extended range, and was equipped with a battery of ten 15-centimeter (5.9 in) guns. Olga was laid down at the AG Vulcan in Stettin in 1879, she was launched in December 1880, and she was completed in January 1882.\n\nIn the course of her career, Olga was sent abroad on three major deployments. The first, uneventful voyage came in 1882, and took the vessel to South American waters for a year and a half. During the cruise, Prince Heinrich of Prussia served aboard the ship. The second cruise came shortly thereafter, when the German Admiralty sent her to the German colony of Kamerun as part of the West African Squadron to suppress a rebellion against German rule. Her third cruise took place between 1885 and 1889, and saw the ship alternate between German East Africa and German New Guinea in the central Pacific Ocean. While in Samoa in 1889, Olga was badly damaged by a powerful cyclone and was forced to leave the station for repairs.\n\nFrom 1890, Olga saw limited service, in a variety of subsidiary roles. She was used as a training ship from 1893 to 1897, when she was transferred to the Fishery School.

They form a potassium-rich calc-alkaline suite. Both contain pumices, three different types of which are found in the Atana ignimbrite. Phenocrysts within the ignimbrite are chiefly formed by plagioclase.\n\nBoth the Atana and the Toconao ignimbrite include minerals like allanite, apatite, biotite, epidote, hornblende, ilmenite, magnetite, monazite, orthopyroxene, plagioclase, quartz, sanidine, titanite and zircon. Not all of these minerals are found in both ignimbrites, and not always in the same phase (crystals or matrix).\n\nUltimately, the magmas at La Pacana are the products of mantle melts interacting with various crustal domains deep in the crust, within the partially molten zone that has been found at depths of c. 20 kilometres (12 mi) beneath the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex.\n\nVarious geothermometers indicate that the Toconao ignimbrite was colder than the Atana ignimbrite; temperatures have been estimated at 730\u2013750 \u00b0C (1,350\u20131,380 \u00b0F) and 750\u2013790 \u00b0C (1,380\u20131,450 \u00b0F) respectively.

It was the last silver coin of that denomination to be struck before passage of the Coinage Act of 1873, which temporarily ended production of the silver dollar for American commerce. The coin's obverse is based on that of the Gobrecht dollar, which had been minted experimentally from 1836 to 1839. However, the soaring eagle used on the reverse of the Gobrecht dollar was not used; instead, the United States Mint (Mint) used a heraldic eagle, based on a design by late Mint Chief Engraver John Reich first utilized on coins in 1807.\n\nSeated Liberty dollars were initially struck only at the Philadelphia Mint; in 1846, production began at the New Orleans facility. In the late 1840s, the price of silver increased relative to gold because of an increase in supply of the latter caused by the California Gold Rush; this led to the hoarding, export, and melting of American silver coins. The Coinage Act of 1853 decreased the weight of all silver coins of five cents or higher, except for the dollar, but also required a supplemental payment from those wishing their bullion struck into dollar coins. As little silver was being presented to the US Mint at the time, production remained low. In the final years of the series, there was more silver produced in the US, and mintages increased.\n\nIn 1866, \"In God We Trust\" was added to the dollar following its introduction to United States coinage earlier in the decade. Seated Liberty dollar production was halted by the Coinage Act of 1873, which authorized the trade dollar for use in foreign commerce. Representatives of silver interests were unhappy when the metal's price dropped again in the mid-1870s; they advocated the resumption of the free coinage of silver into legal tender, and after the passage of the Bland\u2013Allison Act in 1878, production resumed with the Morgan dollar.\n\n","h_score":1683141.9125000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":2205026,"revid":1173255450,"description":"United States silver dollar coin minted from 1840 to 1873","categories":["1840 introductions","Eagles on coins","Goddess of Liberty on coins","United States dollar coins","United States silver coins"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's the Seated Liberty dollar?  \nA1: It's a 19th-century U.S. silver coin with Liberty lounging gracefully, symbolizing freedom's perch.  \n\nQ2: When was it minted?  \nA2: From 1836 to 1873, capturing America's westward rush in shiny metal.  \n\nQ3: Who designed it?  \nA3: Christian Gobrecht crafted this seated icon, blending art and patriotism.  \n\nQ4: What does it look like?  \nA4: Liberty sits on the front, holding symbols of liberty; an eagle soars on the back, fierce yet balanced.  \n\nQ5: What materials were used?  \nA5: Mostly silver, sometimes with gold undertones, evoking treasure from the wild frontier.  \n\nQ6: Why is it valuable?  \nA6: Its rarity and history make it a collector's gem, whispering tales of bygone eras.  \n\nQ7: Were there variations?  \nA7: Yes, with motto changes reflecting evolving ideals, like a coin evolving with time.  \n\nQ8: How does it reflect U.S. history?  \nA8: It mirrors expansion and change, from Liberty's seat to industrial might, in every etched detail."}

According to a statement in Jordanes's Getica, Germanus was a descendant of the noble Roman clan of the Anicii. The exact nature of his connection, however, if indeed it is anything more than a literary device to indicate noble descent, is unclear. Theodor Mommsen hypothesized that his mother could have been a daughter of Anicia Juliana. During the reign of Emperor Justin I, he was raised to high office (he is recorded as a vir illustris in a 519 letter addressed to him by Pope Hormisdas), eventually being appointed as magister militum per Thraciae. In this capacity, he scored a crushing victory over an invasion of the Antae.\n\nBy 536, he was raised to the honorary consulate and the rank of patricius, and held the post of magister militum praesentalis. In that year, he was sent to North Africa to succeed Solomon as military commander, with the task of suppressing a large-scale mutiny of the Byzantine troops led by Stotzas. His tenure there, described by Procopius, was a thorough success. By appearing conciliatory and paying the arrears, he won over a large part of the mutinous army. He then defeated the remaining rebels under Stotzas at the Battle of Scalas Veteres in the spring of 537 and stabilized the situation by suppressing another conspiracy amongst his troops (cf. Maximinus) and restoring discipline.\n\nGermanus was recalled by Emperor Justinian in 539, and sent to Antioch in 540 at the outbreak of the Lazic War with Sassanid Persia. Heavily outnumbered by the Persians, he retreated to Cilicia and was unable to prevent the catastrophic sack of Antioch in the same year. In the next year, as Belisarius assumed command in the East, Germanus returned to Constantinople.\n\n ### Conspiracy of Artabanes\n\nBy 548, he was acknowledged as the most influential of Emperor Justinian's relatives and his heir apparent, although this was never formally recognized. In that year, his position was strengthened further by the death of Empress Theodora, who disliked him intensely. His stature at court was such that a plot was hatched by the disaffected general Artabanes and his kinsman Arsaces to assassinate Emperor Justinian and replace him with Germanus. The conspirators thought Germanus amenable to their plans, since he had been dissatisfied with Emperor Justinian's meddling in the settling of the will of his recently deceased brother Boraides.\n\nThe conspirators first told Justin, Germanus's eldest son, of their intentions. He, in turn, informed his father, who then held counsel with the comes excubitorum, Marcellus. In order to find out more of their intentions, Germanus met the conspirators in person, while a trusted aide of Marcellus, named Leontius, was concealed nearby and listened in. Marcellus then informed Emperor Justinian, and the conspirators were arrested, but treated with remarkable leniency. At first, Germanus and his sons too were suspected, until the testimony of Marcellus and the commanders Constantianus and Bouzes cleared them.\n\n","h_score":1688238.58125,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":1706377,"revid":1147234370,"description":"Byzantine general","categories":["550 deaths","6th-century Byzantine people","Anicii","Byzantine North Africa","Generals of Justinian I","Justinian dynasty","Magistri militum","Year of birth unknown"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Germanus: Justinian's Shadowy Strategist\n\nGermanus, the cousin of Byzantine Emperor Justinian I, emerged as a formidable general in the 6th century, influencing key military campaigns.

Approximately 64,695 Pounds of Shark Fins","reference":"### District court In 2004 the government went before Moskowitz seeking summary judgement. The case turned on whether the KD II was a fishing vessel under the SFPA. Early in 2005 he issued his ruling, holding that while it was not directly engaged in fishing it was nevertheless engaging in activities supporting fishing and thus also subject to the SFPA. He did not grant the forfeiture as NOAA had not moved for it yet. The SFPA deferred to the Magnuson\u2013Stevens Act for its definition of a fishing vessel. According to that statute, a fishing vessel was one that either engaged in fishing, or \"aiding or assisting one or more vessels at sea in the performance of any activity relating to fishing, including, but not limited to, preparation, supply, storage, refrigeration, transportation, or processing.\" Moskowitz rejected NOAA's argument that the KD II was engaged in fishing and therefore a fishing vessel because, under its previous ownership, it had been equipped with longline equipment and held a federal permit. That had lapsed shortly after Tran and Yu bought the ship and was no longer valid, so neither was the argument based on paper. \"Whether the KD II is in fact a fishing vessel under [the first definition] depends on its configuration and how it was outfitted at the time of the seizure\", he wrote. Since there was nothing in the record about that, he declined to decide the question on that grounds. There was more to consider when Moskowitz turned to the support aspect. \"Simply put, the issue in this case narrows down to whether the KD II is a vessel which was used for, equipped to be used for, or of a type which is normally used for aiding or assisting one or more vessels at sea in the performance of any activity relating to fishing.\" On this question Moskowitz agreed with NOAA. By going from ship to ship to buy, store and transport the fins, the KD II and its crew \"directly aided and assisted the foreign vessels in an expressly enumerated fishing activity under the statute.\" Moskowitz qualified his interpretation by disagreeing with the government's assertion that the mere purchase of the fins constituted an activity in support of fishing, pointing out that that would make into a fishing vessel any ship where someone aboard purchased a single fin for personal use. But in this case the KD II and its crew had acted as a middleman, \"effectively br[inging] the shark fin market to the foreign fishing vessels at sea. This act, in and of itself, aided and assisted the foreign fishing vessels which no longer had to store, transport, and land their shark fins in order to sell them in the market.\" By doing so, they had saved time and money for the other fishing vessels they had taken fins from. He cited a document in the records, a communication between Tran and the Korean broker explicitly saying that a rendezvous \"will save our time and cost\" as proof. \"Commonsense suggests that buying fish from fishermen at sea for resale is an activity related to fishing under the SFPA\", wrote Moskowitz.","h_score":1645090.7000000002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":35152261,"revid":1161133618,"description":"Court appeal concerning shark finning","categories":["2008 in United States case law","2008 in the environment","Shark finning","United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit cases","United States admiralty case law","United States civil forfeiture case law","United States environmental case law","United States in rem cases","United States statutory interpretation case law"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the case about?  \nA1: It involved the US government seizing over 64,000 pounds of shark fins in 2012 for illegal trade violations.\n\nQ2: Who were the main parties?  \nA2: The United States was the plaintiff, targeting importers who violated wildlife laws.\n\nQ3: Why were the fins seized?  \nA3: They stemmed from unsustainable fishing, breaching protections against shark finning.\n\nQ4: What laws were involved?  \nA4: The Lacey Act and shark finning bans were key, prohibiting illicit wildlife trade.\n\nQ5: What was the court's decision?  \nA5: The fins were forfeited, with fines imposed on the offenders.\n\nQ6: How did it impact conservation?  \nA6: It highlighted shark population threats, boosting global protection efforts.\n\nQ7: What broader lessons emerged?  \nA7: It showed enforcement's role in curbing illegal trade and promoting ocean health.\n\nQ8: Why is this case still relevant?  \nA8: It underscores ongoing fights against wildlife crime, inspiring stricter policies worldwide."}

It moved rapidly westward, developing into a tropical depression on September 11 about 800 miles (1,300 km) east of the Windward Islands. It was one of seven active tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin that day, one of the most active single days on record. It existed at a fairly low latitude and failed to intensify due to the unfavorable combination of Hurricane Ginger and a long trough to its northwest. On September 13, the depression passed just south of Barbados and subsequently entered the Caribbean Sea. Interacting with the terrain of South America, the center became broad and ill-defined, although Cura\u00e7ao reported winds of near tropical storm force as it crossed the island on September 16. It later moved near or over northern Venezuela and Colombia. As it approached the western Caribbean, the depression was able to organize more, with less influence from landmass or the trough to its north. At 0000 UTC on September 17, it is estimated the depression attained tropical storm status; that day, it was named Irene about 350 miles (560 km) east of San Andr\u00e9s. Initially, the storm was expected to track west-northwestward toward the northwest Caribbean, similar to the track taken by the destructive Hurricane Edith two weeks prior. Tropical Storm Irene gradually intensified as it continued across the southwestern Caribbean Sea. Late on September 18, the storm attained hurricane status a short distance off the coast of Central America, with 80 mph (130 km\/h) winds, its peak intensity in the Atlantic Ocean. As it strengthened, it developed an eye and spiral rainbands that extended across Panama into the Pacific Ocean. Hurricane Irene weakened slightly as it approached the coast, although its pressure dropped to 989 mbar. On September 19, the hurricane made landfall in the Nicaraguan South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region; it was the first tropical cyclone of hurricane intensity since 1911 to strike Nicaragua south of Bluefields. Irene quickly weakened, deteriorating to tropical depression status within 18 hours of moving ashore. The circulation remained organized over the low-lying terrain of southern Nicaragua, possibly due to it crossing Lake Nicaragua. After reaching the Pacific Ocean on September 20, the depression restrengthened to attain tropical storm status; upon doing so, it was re-designated by a new name, Olivia. It was the first time an Atlantic hurricane was tracked as a tropical cyclone while crossing Central America into the Pacific Ocean; subsequent research indicated there were earlier storms that accomplished the feat, although they were not known at the time. As an Eastern Pacific tropical cyclone, Olivia maintained well-defined outflow and inflow. It gradually intensified as it paralleled the southern Central America coastline. Late on September 21, a Hurricane Hunters flight reported winds of 80 mph (130 km\/h) and an eye 23 miles (37 km) in diameter; based on the readings, Olivia was upgraded to hurricane status. For several days, Olivia moved west to west-northwestward off the coast of Mexico, although its exact intensity fluctuations were unknown, due to lack of significant observations. On September 25, the eye became very pronounced on satellite imagery, and based on a report from the Hurricane Hunters, it is estimated Olivia reached peak winds of 115 mph (185 km\/h), about 245 miles (394 km) southwest of Manzanillo, Colima. The Hurricane Hunters also reported a pressure of 948 mbar, which was the lowest reported pressure during the 1971 Pacific hurricane season. The intensity of Hurricane Olivia fluctuated for two days as it turned westward away from land, due to a blocking ridge over northwestern Mexico. Early on September 26 it weakened to winds of about 105 mph (169 km\/h), before it quickly restrengthened to its previous peak intensity. Subsequently, dry air became entrained in the circulation, and Olivia began to weaken as it moved over cooler waters. The eye became disorganized and eventually dissipated. Late on September 28 it weakened to tropical storm status, after beginning a turn to the northwest and later to the north. About 24 hours later, Olivia weakened to tropical depression status as it approached the coastline of the Baja California Peninsula. Most of the thunderstorm activity dissipated by the time the depression moved ashore on September 30; the next day, Olivia dissipated near the border of Baja California and Baja California Sur.","h_score":1686639.59375,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":23127217,"revid":1171663604,"description":"Category 3 Atlantic and Pacific hurricane in 1971","categories":["1971 Atlantic hurricane season","1971 Pacific hurricane season","1971 in Mexico","1971 natural disasters in the United States","Category 1 Atlantic hurricanes","Category 3 Pacific hurricanes","Hurricanes and tropical depressions of the Gulf of California","Hurricanes in Arizona","Hurricanes in California","Hurricanes in Costa Rica","Hurricanes in New Mexico","Hurricanes in Nicaragua","Hurricanes in Texas","Pacific hurricanes in Mexico"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's Hurricane Irene-Olivia?  \nA1: A fierce 2011 Atlantic storm, Irene, that morphed into Pacific Olivia\u2014nature's wild rename dance.  \n\nQ2: When and where did it hit?  \nA2: Irene struck in August 2011 along the US East Coast; Olivia swirled into the Pacific soon after.  \n\nQ3: How strong was it?  \nA3: Irene packed Category 3 winds, flooding cities; Olivia echoed as a tropical storm with dramatic swells.  \n\nQ4: What damages occurred?  \nA4: Billions in floods and power outages from Irene; Olivia added coastal erosion with watery fury.  \n\nQ5: Why the name change?  \nA5: Storms cross basins, so Irene became Olivia\u2014meteorology's quirky identity swap under global watches.  \n\nQ6: Any lessons learned?  \nA6: Better evacuations and forecasts emerged; communities braced for future tempests with wiser resolve.  \n\nQ7: How does it compare to others?  \nA7: Weaker than Katrina but wider than Harvey, it highlighted evolving storm patterns with vivid chaos.  \n\nQ8: What might we expect next?  \nA8: Warmer oceans brew stronger whirlwinds; Irene-Olivia whispers of adaptation in our turbulent world."}

Inspired by her relationship with artist Matthew Barney, Bj\u00f6rk wanted to create a record with a domestic mood. Working with Knak, she wrote \"Cocoon\", a song which is lyrically about a woman who describes making love with her lover during their post-coital hibernation, and includes frank sexual narrative related both explicitly and through over-sharing and metaphor.\n\nMusic critics received \"Cocoon\" with positive reviews, calling it one of the album's highlights.

However, the throne was seized by Gotarzes II, an adopted son of Artabanus II. Gotarzes had another of his brothers, Artabanus, along with his wife and child, executed shortly after. An uproar against this execution shortly followed, with an appeal being sent to Vardanes, who took Gotarzes by surprise and defeated him, after travelling 375 miles in two days. Vardanes was supported by the governors of the neighbouring Parthian provinces, and quickly gained control over most of the Parthian realm. The Mesopotamian city of Seleucia, which had been in rebellion since 35 AD, did not acknowledge Vardanes, who then besieged the city. However, the long siege of Seleucia resulted in Gotarzes gaining the upper hand in the conflict, allowing him to raise a new force and drive off Vardanes, who fled to Bactria in Central Asia. A contemporary bust of a Parthian king was discovered at the ancient court of the Yuezhis (early Kushans) in Khalchayan, Bactria, suggesting that this may represent Vardanes as he sought refuge, and possibly an alliance, at the Yuezhi court. At the same time, Armenia suffered turmoil, when its Arsacid king Orodes, the brother of Vardanes, was deposed by the Roman emperor Claudius (r. 41\u201354), who appointed the Pharnavazid prince Mithridates in his stead. Just before Vardanes and Gotarzes clashed in battle, they reached an accord after Gotarzes informed Vardanes of a conspiracy being planned against them by a prominent group. Under the accord Vardanes was to keep his crown, while Gotarzes became the ruler of Hyrcania. In June 42, Vardanes forced Seleucia to submit to the Parthians again after a rebellion of seven years. He significantly reduced the autonomy of the city and removed its privilege to mint its own coins. Around the same time, the Greek philosopher Apollonius of Tyana visited the court of Vardanes, who provided him with the protection of a caravan as he travelled to the realm of the Indo-Parthians. When Apollonius reached Indo-Parthia's capital Taxila, his caravan leader read Vardanes' official letter, perhaps written in Parthian, to an Indian official who treated Apollonius with great hospitality. Encouraged by his recent triumphs, Vardanes prepared to invade and reconquer Armenia, but ultimately abandoned his plans, due to threats of war from the Roman governor of Syria, Gaius Vibius Marsus, and the renewed conflict with Gotarzes, who had terminated their accord. Vardanes defeated Gotarzes on the Erindes, a river situated on the Media-Hyrcania border. He then proceeded to conquer the remaining Parthian provinces, reaching as far as Aria. In c. 46 he was assassinated while hunting at the instigation of a party of Parthian nobles, who feared that their status might become endangered.","h_score":1683721.1625000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":1682337,"revid":1159848000,"description":"King of the Parthian Empire (ruled AD 40-46)","categories":["1st-century Iranian people","1st-century Parthian monarchs","1st-century murdered monarchs","45 deaths","Murdered Persian monarchs","Year of birth unknown"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Unraveling the Reign of Vardanes I\n\nVardanes I was a king of the Parthian Empire who ruled in the 1st century AD, marked by military conflicts and internal strife.

The Punishment Due\" finds its thematic inspiration derived from the Northern Ireland conflict, in which the largely Catholic nationalist community were in conflict with the mainly Protestant loyalist community over the sovereignty of the six counties of Northern Ireland. Mustaine has said that at a show in Antrim, Northern Ireland, he discovered bootlegged Megadeth T-shirts were on sale. He was dissuaded from taking action to have them removed on the basis that they were part of fund raising activities for \"The Cause\", explained as something to bring equality to Catholics and Protestants in the region. Liking how \"The Cause\" sounded as was explained to him, Mustaine dedicated a performance of \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" to it, causing the audience to riot. The band were forced to travel in a bulletproof bus after the show. This incident, along with Marvel's Punisher, inspired Mustaine to write the song.\n\n\"Rust in Peace...

Mustaine has revealed that the song, originally titled \"Child Saint\", was one of his earlier compositions, having been written before his tenure with Metallica (1982\u201383). Menza proposed the concept for \"Hangar 18\", a song about UFO conspiracies and Area 51.

While this was a higher chart position than Jackson's two previous releases, it was a lower first week sales total compared to Damita Jo which opened with sales of 381,000 and 20 Y.O. with sales of 296,000. Paul Grein of Yahoo! Music observed that with six number one studio albums, Jackson had \"surpasse[d] her brother Michael Jackson, who has amassed five [number-one] albums.\" With six number one albums, Jackson is now tied with Mariah Carey and Britney Spears in the US for the third most number-one albums for a female artist, behind Madonna with eight and Barbra Streisand's ten chart-toppers. In its second week, the album fell to number three with 57,000 copies sold. In its third week, the album fell to number eight with sales of 38,000 copies. In its fourth week, the album fell to number seventeen with sales of 34,000 copies, achieving total first-month sales of 310,000 copies. It has sold 600,000 copies in the United States to date.\n\nThe album achieved moderate success in other countries, reaching number three in Canada (with 6,000 copies sold during its first week), and number nine in Switzerland, but had low sales in most European markets. By June 2008, Island stopped promoting Discipline. The singer expressed open dissatisfaction with the promotion of the album, explaining that there would be no further single releases. The album was a commercial failure in the United Kingdom, spending only one week on the UK Albums Chart and peaking at number 63 with 3,914 copies sold, but it did manage to peak at number five on the UK R&B Album Chart. It has sold 9,312 copies in the country. In France, Discipline debuted at number 43 with just 3,000 copies sold. In Japan, the album debuted at number nine with 19,839 copies sold. It has been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) and has sold over 100,000 copies in the country.\n\n ## Label change\n\nOn September 22, 2008\u2014while on the Live Nation-supported tour of North America\u2014Jackson parted company with her recording label Island; their 14-month relationship was dissolved per a request by Jackson. The singer had previously expressed dissatisfaction with the label, first telling SOHH.com that they \"stopped all promotion whatsoever on the album\" after releasing the first single, \"Feedback\". In early September she had stated, \"I can't say if we'll be working with them in the future. I don't know what the future holds between the two of us.\" A spokesperson for Jackson added, \"[Jackson] will have autonomy over her career, without the restrictions of a label system... Always known to break new ground and set trends, Janet's departure from Island Records makes her one of the first superstar artists to have the individual freedom to promote their work through a variety of avenues such as iTunes, mobile carriers and other diverse and innovative channels\".\n\nJackson told Sister 2 Sister magazine, \"There were some people who didn't like the direction I took with this album. I love doing dance songs and I think my fans expect that of me. I have been getting more behind the scenes with film and television. I will probably continue to do music \u2013 and acting is still a strong passion of mine \u2013 but I really have been loving behind-the-scenes work: producing, directing and all the technical stuff\".

They were to use the same boiler as the K and N classes and the general layout was similar to designs used by the GWR in South Wales. Nothing came of this proposal because of other commitments and the absorption of the SECR into the Southern Railway. In 1922, Holcroft suggested that 3-cylinder 2-6-0 tender locomotives with 6 ft (1,830 mm) driving wheels should be built instead of tank locomotives. Despite the benefit of a greater operational range, Holcroft's immediate superior, Clayton, refused to pass this suggestion on to Maunsell. The 3-cylinder principle was therefore applied to the K class. At the Southern Railway's January 1925 Locomotive Committee meeting, when it was decided to use outside contractors to build the K class, Maunsell received authority to retain one set of parts at Ashford works to construct a prototype 3-cylinder 2-6-4 tank. The modification was based upon that used on N class No. 822 to produce a 3-cylinder locomotive in 1922, although it retained the 6 ft (1,830 mm) driving wheels and shorter wheelbase of the K class. The modification was the inclusion of an additional (inside) cylinder between the frames, and a crank axle was fitted to the middle driving wheels. The axle was connected to the inside cylinder assembly by a connecting rod inclined at 1 in 8 to clear the front driving axle. This arrangement was supplemented by two smaller-diameter outside cylinders with 16 in (406 mm) bore (compared to the 19 in (483 mm) cylinders of the K class), and a greater chimney diameter. The resulting prototype 3-cylinder \"K1\" was narrower than the K class and hence could work on routes with restricted loading gauge. As with No. 822, this locomotive used Holcroft's derivative of the Gresley conjugated valve gear to drive the inside cylinder. To accommodate this, the boiler had to be raised by 3 in (76 mm) above the inside gear, raising the centre of gravity on the locomotive. The main visual difference between the K and K1 classes was at the front end: the K1 incorporated a vertical metal cover above the front buffer beam to protect the third cylinder and associated Holcroft valve gear assembly from the elements. It also featured a new cab design with redesigned single front spectacle plates, and a pair of substantially constructed steps were fitted behind both outside cylinders to provide access to the running plate. The lack of a middle cylinder on the K class locomotives had allowed the provision of a footplate that curved from the buffers to the water tanks. The K1 prototype emerged from Ashford works as No. A890, and underwent trials from 1 December 1925 before entering regular service. Only one locomotive of the K1 class was built; plans to build a further ten (Nos. A891-A900) alongside a batch of five N1 class 2-6-0s were cancelled after the Sevenoaks accident in August 1927. Following rebuilding as a 2-6-0 tender locomotive in 1928, No. A890 was reclassified U1 and was the forerunner of twenty more basically similar locomotives built in 1931. ### K and K1 class construction history\n\n ### Naming the locomotives\n\nThe K class prototype operated without a name until 1925, when the Southern Railway's publicity department decided to name all express passenger locomotives. The locomotives constructed from 1925 were named after rivers found within the Southern Railway's operating area, and the class became known collectively as the River class. The first-completed Southern Railway K class No. A791 was named River Adur whilst the former SECR prototype was given the name River Avon; names were also allocated to the cancelled 1926 batch of locomotives. The K1 class locomotive No. A890 was named River Frome. The names were displayed on a rectangular brass nameplate fitted to the water tank sides.\n\n ## Operational details\n\nThe K class was intended to haul the SECR's Kent expresses, and was trialled between Charing Cross, Tonbridge, Canterbury East and Folkestone East. A trial non-stop run between Cannon Street and Folkestone Harbour by No. 790 pulling a train of 300 long tons (305 t) had proved the water capacity of the side tanks to be insufficient for such runs. No. 790 was also tested on fast Cannon Street, Redhill and Tonbridge trains during the spring of 1922, although rough riding between the latter two stations meant slower speeds over that part of route on subsequent runs.\n\nThe Southern Railway's motive power re-organisation following the Grouping of 1923 expanded the class for operations over the Central section. The Westinghouse-fitted Armstrong Whitworth batch was used on the air-braked Eastbourne and Brighton expresses and regular passenger service trains to Portsmouth. The vacuum-braked Brighton batch was run-in on the Portsmouth route in preparation for operating the Redhill\u2013Reading line, the class regularly hauling the daily Birkenhead\u2013Dover through train. The K1 was mainly rostered to haul the early evening express from Cannon Street to Dover Marine.\n\n","h_score":1672382.0375000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":17643033,"revid":1126748609,"description":"Two classes of 20 two-cylinder (K) and 1 three-cylinder (K1) 2-6-4T locomotives","categories":["2-6-4T locomotives","Armstrong Whitworth locomotives","Passenger locomotives","South Eastern and Chatham Railway locomotives","Southern Railway (UK) locomotives","Standard gauge steam locomotives of Great Britain"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What are SECR K and SR K1 classes?  \nA1: These are vintage British steam locomotives\u2014SECR K from 1917, a sturdy workhorse; SR K1, its refined sibling from the 1920s, with sleeker lines.  \n\nQ2: When were they built?  \nA2: SECR K rolled out in 1917 amid wartime urgency; SR K1 followed in 1925, tweaking designs for better efficiency.  \n\nQ3: What did they look like?  \nA3: Imagine iron behemoths with bold boilers and chugging cylinders\u2014SECR K squat and robust, SR K1 taller, more elegant.  \n\nQ4: How do they differ?  \nA4: SECR K had a simpler frame for freight; SR K1 boasted superheating for faster passenger hauls, adding a dash of speed.  \n\nQ5: What were their main uses?  \nA5: Both hauled trains across southern England, but SECR K tackled mixed loads while SR K1 excelled on express routes.  \n\nQ6: How reliable were they?  \nA6: SECR K was a dependable brute, surviving scrapping; SR K1 improved on that with fewer breakdowns, yet both had their fiery tempers.  \n\nQ7: What issues did they face?  \nA7: SECR K struggled with poor steaming; SR K1 fixed that but battled wartime wear, turning routine runs into epic struggles.  \n\nQ8: Why are they remembered today?  \nA8: As icons of railway heritage, they inspire models and museums, their chugging legacy fueling modern nostalgia for steam's golden age."}

It was built in the 1870s by the Severn Bridge Railway Company, primarily to carry coal from the Forest of Dean to the docks at Sharpness; it was the furthest-downstream bridge over the Severn until the opening of the Severn road bridge in 1966. When the company got into financial difficulties in 1893, it was taken over jointly by the Great Western Railway and the Midland Railway companies. The bridge continued to be used for freight and passenger services until 1960, and saw temporary extra traffic on the occasions that the Severn Tunnel was closed for engineering work.\n\nThe bridge was constructed by Hamilston's Windsor Ironworks Company Limited of Garston, Liverpool. It was approached from the north via a masonry viaduct and had twenty-two spans. The pier columns were formed of circular sections, bolted together and filled with concrete. The twenty-one regular wrought iron spans were then put in place, as well as the southernmost span, the swing bridge over the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal. The bridge was 4,162 ft (1,269 m) long and 70 ft (21 m) above high water. 6,800 long tons (7,600 short tons; 6,900 t) of iron were used in its construction.\n\nA number of accidents took place at the bridge over the years, with vessels colliding with the piers due to the strong tides. In 1960 two river barges hit one of the piers on the bridge, causing two spans to collapse into the river. Repair work was under consideration when a similar collision occurred the following year, after which it was decided that it would be uneconomical to repair the bridge. It was demolished between 1967 and 1970, with few traces remaining.\n\n","h_score":1658835.875,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":1067529,"revid":1152175034,"description":"Former bridge in United Kingdom","categories":["1960 disasters in the United Kingdom","1960 in England","Bridge disasters caused by collision","Bridge disasters in the United Kingdom","Bridges across the River Severn","Bridges completed in 1879","Buildings and structures demolished in 1970","Demolished bridges in England","History of Gloucestershire","Lydney","Railway accidents and incidents in Gloucestershire","Railway accidents in 1960","Railway lines closed in 1960","Railway lines opened in 1879","Railway viaducts in Gloucestershire"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Severn Railway Bridge: A Rusting Relic of Rails\n\nThe Severn Railway Bridge once arched boldly over the swirling Severn River, a 19th-century titan of iron and ambition.

It was first published by Wilbur Schramm in 1954 and includes innovations over previous models, such as the inclusion of a feedback loop and the discussion of the role of fields of experience. For Schramm, communication is about sharing information or having a common attitude towards signs. His model is based on three basic components: a source, a destination, and a message. The process starts with an idea in the mind of the source. This idea is then encoded into a message using signs and sent to the destination. The destination needs to decode and interpret the signs to reconstruct the original idea. In response, they formulate their own message, encode it, and send it back as a form of feedback. Feedback is a key part of many forms of communication. It can be used to mitigate processes that may undermine successful communication, such as external noise or errors in the phases of encoding and decoding.\n\nThe success of communication also depends on the fields of experience of the participants. A field of experience includes past life experiences as well as attitudes and beliefs. It affects how the processes of encoding, decoding, and interpretation take place. For successful communication, the message has to be located in the overlap of the fields of experience of both participants. If the message is outside the receiver's field of experience, they are unable to connect it to the original idea. This is often the case when there are big cultural differences.\n\nSchramm holds that the sender usually has some goal they wish to achieve through communication. He discusses the conditions that are needed to have this effect on the audience, such as gaining their attention and motivating them to act towards this goal. He also applies his model to mass communication. One difference from other forms of communication is that successful mass communication is more difficult since there is very little feedback. In the 1970s, Schramm proposed many revisions to his earlier model. They focus on additional factors that make communication more complex. An example is the relation between sender and receiver: it influences the goal of communication and the roles played by the participants.\n\nSchramm's criticism of linear models of communication, which lack a feedback loop, has been very influential. One shortcoming of Schramm's model is that it assumes that the communicators take turns in exchanging information instead of sending messages simultaneously. Another objection is that Schramm conceives information and its meaning as preexisting entities rather than seeing communication as a process that creates meaning.\n\n","h_score":1653209.26875,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":72106078,"revid":1163703437,"description":"Interaction model of communication","categories":["Communication studies","Communication theory","Conceptual modelling","Human communication"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Schramm's model of communication?  \nA1: It's a circular process where sender and receiver exchange messages with feedback, like a dynamic dance of ideas.  \n\nQ2: Who developed this model?  \nA2: Wilbur Schramm created it in the 1950s, drawing from real-world interactions.  \n\nQ3: What are its key components?  \nA3: It includes sender, receiver, message, encoding, decoding, and a vital feedback loop.  \n\nQ4: How does feedback work in the model?  \nA4: Feedback flows both ways, ensuring understanding, much like echoes refining a conversation.  \n\nQ5: How is it different from linear models?  \nA5: Unlike one-way linear models, Schramm's is interactive and cyclical, promoting mutual influence.  \n\nQ6: What real-world applications does it have?  \nA6: It's used in education and media for effective dialogue, fostering clearer exchanges.  \n\nQ7: What are common criticisms of the model?  \nA7: Critics say it oversimplifies complex contexts, ignoring external noise or cultural barriers.  \n\nQ8: Why is it still relevant today?  \nA8: In our digital age, it highlights ongoing feedback in social media, keeping communication vibrant and adaptive."}

On May 6, in a 17-inning, 9\u20136 victory over the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, Davis went hitless in eight at bats, but ended up being the winning pitcher. His feat was the first of its kind since Rube Waddell achieved it on July 4, 1905. Davis was the designated hitter until he was pressed into service as a relief pitcher in the 16th inning after Showalter had depleted the Orioles' bullpen. He struck out two batters and did not allow a run in his two innings of mound work. He was the first position player in the American League (AL) to be the winning pitcher in a game since Rocky Colavito on August 25, 1968, and the first to pitch for the Orioles since Manny Alexander on April 19, 1996. He and losing pitcher Darnell McDonald were the first position players on opposing teams in the same contest to each work in relief since Ty Cobb and George Sisler on October 4, 1925, and the first where both earned pitching decisions since Sam Mertes and Jesse Burkett on September 28, 1902.\n\nOn July 31, Davis hit his first career grand slam, off Yankees pitcher Iv\u00e1n Nova in an 11\u20135 win after the Orioles had faced a five-run deficit. On August 24, Davis had his first career three-homer game in a 6\u20134 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. His second home run was his 22nd of the season, setting a new career high, and it marked the first three-homer game by an Oriole since Nick Markakis had one in 2006. After Markakis suffered a season-ending injury on September 8, Davis moved to right field for the remainder of the season and the playoffs.\n\nDue to a late-season stretch in which he homered six times in the final six games, he finished the regular season with 33 home runs, more than any other Oriole. In 139 games (515 at bats), he batted .270\/.326\/.501 with 139 hits, 20 doubles, and 85 RBI. His 33 home runs also tied Robinson Can\u00f3 for eighth in the AL while his 169 strikeouts tied B. J.

Initially attached to an occluded front, the low detached from the system and gradually acquired tropical characteristics. By 1 October, shower and thunderstorm activity began to develop near the center of the system as it tracked through the central Azores. However, the following day, convection began to decrease over the system, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) ceased monitoring it. Over the following two days, the system executed a counter-clockwise loop near the Azores. During the afternoon of 4 October, convection redeveloped around the center of the low and was classified as a tropical storm near S\u00e3o Miguel Island. Although the storm was tropical at this time, the NHC did not issue advisories for several hours. The first advisory from the NHC was issued at 11:00 AST on 4 October; at this time, the system was officially named Grace, the seventh named storm of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm featured relatively deep convection around an eye-like feature. Although Grace was over waters normally not warm enough for tropical cyclogenesis, low wind shear allowed the convection to persist. A steady northeastward track was taken by the storm in response to a southerly flow over the northwestern Atlantic. The storm intensified slightly as it moved over decreasing sea surface temperatures, with winds estimated at 65 mph (100 km\/h) early on 5 October; operationally it was held at 70 mph (110 km\/h), but was downgraded due to uncertainties in the storm's intensity as it was progressing over cold waters. A large extratropical cyclone near Grace caused the storm to deteriorate in organization, with convection weakening and becoming asymmetric. By this time, the storm was over 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) waters, likely inhibiting convective development. Shower and thunderstorm activity continued to diminish throughout the day on 5 October; however, Grace maintained tropical characteristics, namely a deep, warm core. Early on 6 October, the NHC issued their final advisory on Grace as it merged with a frontal system over the northeastern Atlantic. Just prior to merging, the lowest pressure in relation to the storm was recorded at 986 mbar (hPa; 29. 12 inHg). The extratropical remnants of Grace persisted for roughly 18 hours before dissipating over the Celtic Sea early on 7 October. However, the United States Naval Research Laboratory continued to monitor the system for several more hours until it moved over the North Sea. Although officially designated a tropical cyclone by the NHC, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France, the French meteorological service, stated in their annual report to the World Meteorological Organization that Grace should not have been classified a tropical system. In their report, they argued that although the storm presented deep convection, an eye-like feature, and winds above 60 mph (95 km\/h), the overall development of Grace was more similar to that of a mid-latitude non-tropical cyclone. However, operationally, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France considered Grace to be a subtropical cyclone. They also criticized the NHC for warning on this system based on recent trends of the link between global warming and increased hurricane activity.","h_score":1686501.6062500002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":24579351,"revid":1171830653,"description":"Atlantic tropical storm in 2009","categories":["2009 Atlantic hurricane season","Atlantic tropical storms","Hurricanes in Europe","Hurricanes in the Azores","Tropical cyclones in 2009"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What was Tropical Storm Grace in 2009?  \nA1: It was a short-lived Atlantic tropical storm during the 2009 hurricane season.  \n\nQ2: When did it form and dissipate?  \nA2: Grace formed on August 13 and dissipated by August 17, 2009.  \n\nQ3: Where did it originate?  \nA3: It started as a tropical wave in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.  \n\nQ4: What was its path?  \nA4: The storm moved northeast, approaching the Azores islands.  \n\nQ5: How strong was it?  \nA5: It reached peak winds of about 50 mph, never becoming a hurricane.  \n\nQ6: What impacts did it cause?  \nA6: Grace brought heavy rains and gusty winds to the Azores, with minor flooding.  \n\nQ7: Were there any fatalities?  \nA7: No deaths were reported, but it disrupted local activities briefly.  \n\nQ8: How does it fit into the 2009 season?  \nA8: As a modest storm, Grace highlighted the variability of Atlantic weather patterns."}

The joint judgment reasoned that Parliament could not have intended for corporations that do business with the government to be exempt from the restrictive trade practices provisions in Part IV of the TPA in respect of that business. Emphasising the overall purpose of the TPA, the judges reasoned that the purpose would not be fulfilled if Baxter could claim derivative immunity. In response to the concern that one party to a transaction (the government) would be immune from the TPA while the other party would be bound by it, the joint judgment reasoned there was \"nothing unusual\" about such an outcome.\n\nThe joint judgment did not rule out derivative governmental immunity in all cases. In determining the scope of whether governmental immunity from a statutory provision extends to a party dealing with the government, the judgment adopted the following position of Justice Kitto, then dissenting, in the 1955 High Court case of Wynyard Investments v Commissioner for Railways (NSW):\n\n> The object in view is to ascertain whether the Crown has such an interest in that which would be interfered with if the provision in question were held to bind the corporation that the interference would be, for a legal reason, an interference with some right, interest, power, authority, privilege, immunity or purpose belonging or appertaining to the Crown.\n\nWynyard Investments was a case about governmental immunity generally (not derivative governmental immunity specifically), but Justice Kitto's dissenting judgment extended to derivative governmental immunity.\n\nHaving examined the characteristics of the TPA as a law to promote competitive behaviour, the joint judgment held that the extension of derivative governmental immunity from the TPA to a trading corporation would be a \"remarkable\" conclusion and \"far beyond what is necessary to protect the legal rights of governments, or to prevent a divesting of proprietary, contractual or other legal rights and interests.\"\n\n #### Kirby J\n\nJustice Kirby's judgment agreed with the outcome of the joint judgment, for different reasons. Kirby criticised the concept of governmental immunity itself, stating that \"persisting with [governmental immunity] into the twenty-first century is unacceptable.\"\n\n #### Callinan J\n\nJustice Callinan dissented from the majority, holding that derivative governmental immunity extended to Baxter. Callinan followed Bradken, concluding that it remained authoritative.\n\n ## Reaction to judgment\n\n ### Significance\n\nRobertson Wright, writing after the judgment was handed down, claimed that Baxter'' represented a change to the law, drawing the following conclusions from the judgment:\n\n- The application of derivative governmental immunity depends on a construction of the particular statute (particularly the object and purpose of the statute).\n- As a general rule, derivative governmental immunity applies if the statute's coverage of a person would divest the government of proprietary, contractual, or other legal rights or interests (as opposed to commercial or policy rights or interests).\n\nThe judgment was reported in the press as a significant legal victory for the ACCC. The judgment was also received as an \"historic decision\" setting a precedent for government procurement, on the basis that businesses might no longer be able to rely on immunity from the TPA when contracting with governments.\n\n ### Criticism\n\nNicholas Seddon, a lawyer and academic specialising in commercial and government law, claimed the High Court's judgment leaves \"many uncertainties\", particularly regarding whether derivative governmental immunity will extend to private sector providers carrying out governmental functions that have been contracted to them (as opposed to merely providing goods or services to the government). Robertson Wright echoed these concerns, arguing the joint judgment did not \"set out in as helpful detail\" as it might the factors to be taken into account in deciding whether governmental immunity will derive to a party dealing with the government. Seddon also criticised the outcome of the case itself, arguing it is \"difficult to see how derivative immunity does not inevitably flow\" from the governmental immunity from the TPA. He suggested that the application of the TPA to a party that deals with a government compromises the intention of Parliament that State and Territory governments should be immune from the TPA.\n\n ## Later action\n\nThe ACCC was successful, by a 2\u20131 majority, upon the remittal of the case to the full bench of the Federal Court. The full bench found that Baxter contravened Sections 46 and 47 of the TPA. That judgment ended the eight-year-long litigation between Baxter and the ACCC. It was the first time in over 10 years that a corporation had unsuccessfully defended a prosecution brought by the ACCC for an alleged contravention of Section 46. The full bench declared that Baxter breached Sections 46 and 47 of the TPA, but left it to the ACCC to seek pecuniary penalties. Baxter was refused special leave to appeal to the High Court against the full bench's judgment.","h_score":1658270.55,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":25411784,"revid":1163383054,"description":"2007 High Court of Australia decision","categories":["2007 in Australian law","2007 in case law","Baxter International","Competition law","High Court of Australia cases","Pharmaceutical industry in Australia","Private case law","Sovereign immunity"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's the Baxter case about?  \nA1: It's a classic Aussie legal clash where the consumer watchdog ACCC sued Baxter Healthcare for misleading medical product claims.

Four land-owners made a guarantee for NOK 9 million, with a judicial registration covering an area of 347 hectares (860 acres). They hoped that the value of their land would increase after the tunnel had been built. The same amount was also guaranteed by Fjell Municipality. Public grants were also secured, so the debt would be NOK 27 to 30 million. The planning was done by Chr. F. Gr\u00f8ner, for which the municipality paid the costs. Statistics from the ferry showed that 26,400 cars and 93,902 people had taken it in 1986, which had grown to 40,400 and 121,000 in 1989. The estimates were for a 90% increase until 2000, given an opening in 2002. A bid for the project was gathered from Selmer\u2013Furuholmen, which gave a maximum price of NOK 55 million, given that construction started in 1989. On 12 December 1989, the committee sent an official offer to Hordaland Public Roads Administration whereby they, as a company under establishment, offered to fully finance the tunnel. The plans called for tolls of for a car and an investment cost of NOK 47 million. The plans were at first nearly discarded by the administration, as they felt it was impossible for a community of 400 people to finance such a large project without other grants. However, it became evident that the administration was spending NOK 2 million per year on the ferry service, and as the ferry soon would have to be replaced, this would increase to NOK 3 to 5 million per year. On 1 October 1990, the issue was considered by Hordaland Transport Board, which approved the plans. This was followed up by Hordaland County Council on 19 June 1991, which involved NOK 27 million being financed by debt and NOK 28 to 33 million being financed through reduced subsidies to the ferry. The plans were met with criticism from locals on the Bergen side where the tunnel would emerge. They stated that the plans had \"cheap solutions\" and had unnecessary negative impact on their local environment. This included the demolishing of a football field and lack of noise barriers. Bergen Municipality demanded that the costs of a new field be paid for by the project, and that the tunnel be slightly extended. A new estimate was made, which increased the price by NOK 10.3 million; however, Hordaland Public Roads Administration protested, stating that it would give an inferior road technically, that the existing development plans permitted the construction, and that the noise would not exceed the permitted limits. They concluded that should these demands remain, the increased costs would terminate the project. On 16 November 1992, Bergen City Council voted to allow the tunnel, under the condition that the tunnel project financed a new football field. The decision was appealed by lawyers representing the local community, but this was rejected by Hordaland County Governor on 30 August 1993.","h_score":1647346.925,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":19829733,"revid":1173068902,"description":"Subsea road tunnel in Vestland, Norway","categories":["1996 establishments in Norway","Former toll tunnels","Road tunnels in Bergen","Road tunnels in Vestland","Subsea tunnels in Norway","Tunnels completed in 1996","\u00d8ygarden"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's the Bjor\u00f8y Tunnel, anyway?  \nA1: It's Norway's watery wonder, a subsea road tunnel linking islands to the mainland.\n\nQ2: Where does this tunnel dive?  \nA2: In western Norway near Bergen, burrowing under the sea for island access.\n\nQ3: When did it open its gates?  \nA3: Built in the 1990s, it debuted in 1999, transforming travel forever.\n\nQ4: What's its standout feature?  \nA4: At 5 kilometers long, it's an underwater highway, defying ocean depths with flair.\n\nQ5: How was it engineered?  \nA5: Drilled through rock below sea level, with clever ventilation to keep drivers breathing easy.\n\nQ6: What's its community impact?  \nA6: It bridged isolation, boosting jobs and daily commutes with a dash of adventure.\n\nQ7: Any environmental twists?  \nA7: Designed to minimize marine disruption, but raises questions on long-term sea effects.\n\nQ8: What's a quirky fact?  \nA8: This tunnel's a global deep-dive champ, inspiring future underwater roads with its bold spirit."}

The strongest earthquake in state history, it registered an estimated Richter scale magnitude of 5.1 and resulted in minor damage. Damage was limited to Shelby and Jefferson counties and reached its maximum severity near the epicenter in the city of Irondale, including cracked windows, fallen chimneys, and dried-up wells. While there were no fatalities, the earthquake spawned widespread panic, prompting alarmed workers to evacuate tall buildings.\n\nThe earthquake originated in the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone, a fault noted for earthquakes of moderate magnitude. Faulting in the area is strike-slip-oriented, probably because of the Alabama-New York Lineament, which runs adjacent to the seismic zone. Several scientists believe that small earthquakes from the zone indicate the reactivation of deep, ancient faults. Alabama has seen roughly 20 earthquakes since the beginning of the 20th century. The earthquakes have been moderate, never reaching above magnitude 5.1, and they tend to cause damage only near their epicenters while reaching areas much further away. Major events include those in 1916, 1997, and 2003. Despite the lack of powerful seismic events in Alabama, earthquakes from nearby fault zones, including the New Madrid Seismic Zone, pose a serious threat to infrastructure. An earthquake similar in size to the 1916 Irondale event today could damage thousands of buildings and cause up to \\$1 billion in damage.\n\n ## Background\n\n ### Regional\n\nSeismicity in the south\u2013central United States is moderately powerful. The energy from a mid-continent earthquake extends over as much as ten times the area of a similarly sized earthquake in the western United States. A magnitude 4.0 earthquake west of the Rocky Mountains reaches up to 60 miles (97 km) from its epicenter, while a magnitude 5.5 earthquake in the eastern US can be felt 300 miles (483 km) from its epicenter. Science failed to explain the phenomena until 1978, when geologists discovered a massive fault line running from the middle of the continent to its eastern coast. More recent magnetic surveys show that the structure is a 500-million year-old strike-slip fault, which starts under the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone and runs to the eastern coast. This corresponds to the strike-slip faulting exhibited in the Eastern Tennessee Zone, and explains the presence of mid-continent earthquakes in the United States. Still, it is not clear if the fault is definitely related to mid-continental seismicity.\n\n ### Local\n\nEarthquakes in Alabama are sporadic, and tend to cause little to no damage. During a 91-year period, there were 19 earthquakes, varying from near-imperceptible to damaging. The first known activity in Alabama, the New Madrid earthquakes of 1812, registered Mercalli intensities of VII (Very strong) throughout the northern and central portions of the state. On February 4, 1886, the first recorded earthquake from Alabama hit the western part of the state, jolting people in Sumter and Marengo counties.\n\nFollowing minor events in 1917, 1927, 1931, and 1939, threatening activity resumed in the late 1950s, when, in 1957, an earthquake near Birmingham extended from northern Alabama to Georgia and Tennessee, cracking and displacing small objects. A 1959 event in Huntsville, although smaller, damaged chimneys, wrecked plaster, and threw objects from shelves and tables. More recently, events occurred in Escambia County in 1997 and in 2003 in Fort Payne, registering magnitudes of 4.9 and spawning shaking. The Fort Payne earthquake spread over 13 states and wrought structural cracks.\n\n","h_score":1655410.6187500001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":27510247,"revid":1155374021,"description":"Earthquake in Alabama on October 18, 1916","categories":["1916 earthquakes","1916 in Alabama","1916 natural disasters in the United States","Earthquakes in the United States","Natural disasters in Alabama"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The 1916 Irondale Earthquake: Nature's Sudden Fury\n\nIn 1916, a powerful earthquake struck Irondale, rattling the region with tremors that toppled buildings and disrupted daily life.

A village of about 1,400 people, Jifna has retained a Christian majority since the 6th century. Its total land area consists of 6,015 dunams, of which 420 are designated as built-up areas, most of the remainder being covered with olive, fig and apricot groves. Jifna is governed by a village council, led (2008) by chairman Jabi Na'im Kamil.\n\nJifna was known as Gophnah (Hebrew: \u05d2\u05d5\u05e4\u05e0\u05d4; Greek: \u0393\u03bf\u03c6\u03bd\u03b1, Gophna) at the time of the First Jewish-Roman War, and after its conquest became a Roman regional capital, though remaining predominantly Jewish. Jewish presence at the site is thought to have ended in the aftermath of the Bar Kokhba revolt. Later, the town grew less significant politically, but nevertheless prospered as a Christian locality under Byzantine and later Arab rule due to its location on a trade route. St. George's Church in Jifna was built in the 6th century, but fell into disrepair and was not rebuilt until the arrival of the Crusaders in the late 10th century. However, it again fell into ruin after the Crusaders were driven out by the Ayyubids. In modern times, the ruins of St. George's Church have become a tourist attraction. During the period of Ottoman control in Palestine the tower of an ancient Roman structure in Jifna became the location of a jail house.\n\nJifna has local traditions and legends relating to the Holy Family, and to the village water-spring. It is also locally known for its apricot harvest festival; each year, during the late Spring period, hundreds travel to the village to harvest the fruit during its brief season.\n\n ## History\n\n","h_score":1641697.3187500001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":16414959,"revid":1150924693,"description":"Palestinian village in Ramallah and al-Bireh, State of Palestine","categories":["Ancient Jewish settlements of Judaea","Municipalities of the State of Palestine","Palestinian Christian communities","Villages in the State of Palestine"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Jifna: A Palestinian Village in the West Bank\n\nJifna is a historic village located in the West Bank, dating back to ancient times with ties to early Christian sites.

Isa was raised to the throne on 16 April 1154 at the age of five, after the murder of his father and two of his uncles, by the vizier, Abbas ibn Abi al-Futuh, and his son, Nasr. He was given the regnal name al-F\u0101\u02beiz bi-Na\u1e63r All\u0101h, 'Victorious with God's Help'. The sight of his uncle's corpses, and the loud cries of acclamation from the assembled troops of the Fatimid army frightened the young boy. Throughout his life, the common belief was that his subsequent epileptic seizures and tremors were a result of these traumatic experiences. For the same reason, his role in public ceremonies was limited; the annual ceremony celebrating the flooding of the Nile was even held at night during his reign. The bloody events soon resulted in Abbas' own downfall. Terrified women in the Fatimid family called upon the Armenian-born governor of Asyut, Tala'i ibn Ruzzik, for assistance, reportedly sending their own cut hair in supplication. Ibn Ruzzik readily agreed and marched on Cairo. Abbas tried to resist, but faced general opposition: most of the troops were reluctant to support him or defected outright, and the remainder found themselves under attack by the populace with stones. In the end, on 29 May Abbas had to force his way out of the capital with his son and a handful of followers. The party made for Syria but was intercepted on 6 June by the Crusaders near the Dead Sea. Abbas was killed, and Nasr was sold to the Fatimids; he was mutilated and beaten to death by the palace women. Ibn Ruzzik was named vizier with plenipotentiary powers on 17 June, while the underage al-Fa'iz was placed under the tutelage of his aunts, headed by al-Zafir's sister Sitt al-Qusur ('Lady of the Palaces'), who had played a leading role in securing revenge against Abbas and Nasr for the murder of her brothers. Outside the walls of the Great Fatimid Palaces, Ibn Ruzzik was the actual ruler of the state, and al-Fa'iz was virtually his prisoner. A Twelver Shi'ite, he actively sponsored the Alid ashraf in the Hijaz and Iraq, but he made no attempt to depose the Fatimid dynasty, instead ruling on its behalf as a de facto king in the style of the all-powerful and illustrious Armenian viziers Badr al-Jamali and al-Afdal Shahanshah, whom he attempted to emulate. Ibn Ruzzik's position was not without its challenges: in 1155, and again in 1157, he faced uprisings against him by provincial governors. Seeking to bolster his legitimacy, Ibn Ruzzik returned to an aggressive policy against the Crusaders in Palestine. He scored some successes with a naval attack on Tyre in 1155 and with raids at Gaza and Hebron in 1157 and 1158, but his efforts to secure Egypt through an alliance with the Zengids of Syria under Nur al-Din Zangi failed. When Baldwin III of Jerusalem prepared an invasion of Egypt in 1160, he had to be bought off. Ibn Ruzzik's reputation as a holy warrior, a poet, and a patron of culture was counterbalanced by his despotic rule, resorting to confiscations to address the by now chronic shortfalls of revenue, exacerbated by the active pursuit of the war against the Crusaders. Al-Fa'iz died during an epileptic seizure on 22 July 1160. Ibn Ruzzik chose another underage child to succeed him: al-Fa'iz's nine-year-old cousin al-Adid, who was wed to one of the vizier's daughters for good measure. He was to be the last Fatimid caliph. ## See also\n\n- List of rulers of Egypt","h_score":1664594.46875,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":4341989,"revid":1173738572,"description":"Imam and Fatimid Dynasty Caliph from 1154 to 1160","categories":["1149 births","1160 deaths","12th-century Fatimid caliphs","Deaths from epilepsy","Egyptian Ismailis","Egyptian people with disabilities","Hafizi imams","Medieval child monarchs","Monarchs who died as children","Neurological disease deaths in Egypt","Royalty and nobility with disabilities","Royalty and nobility with epilepsy","Sons of Fatimid caliphs"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Al-Fa'iz bi-Nasr Allah: The Short-Lived Fatimid Caliph\n\nAl-Fa'iz bi-Nasr Allah ruled as the 12th Fatimid caliph from 1160 until his assassination later that year.

Taylor highlighted the quality and confidence of the members' vocals, as well as the \"bold, saucy attitude evident here that's more convincing than in the past.\" He also complimented the \"swift, clever, kicky\" production. Craig Seymour of Entertainment Weekly gave the track a B\u2212 rating, writing that the girls \"sound like they really, really wanna be Destiny's Child\" on the song. Seymour also praised \"its charms\", praising the \"easy yet funky groove, their exaggerated British accents\", as well as Darkchild's \"familiar slapping, kinetic beats\". He also called it \"their most compelling reason to dance\" since their single \"Say You'll Be There\" (1996). Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic simply picked the song as one of the best from Forever. According to Jackson Langford from MTV Australia, \"Holler\" was \"easily the biggest surprise the Spice Girls ever managed to pull off\", but it \"feels so far apart from what fans are used to\", although being \"at least somewhat enjoyable\". Similarly, Julia Jafaar from the New Straits Times wrote, \"Those who have heard the hit single, Holler, from the new album, would probably attest that the music arrangement and style\" were atypical of the group and its previous hits. Jenny North from Dotmusic considered the track \"slick, fun, as catchy as crabs and the girls are sounding sexier than ever before\", predicting it would \"lodge itself in your head with the rest of their back catalogue\" after a few listens. Writing for the same website, Cyd Jaymes wrote that \"Holler\" and \"Let Love Lead The Way\" were the best songs on Forever \"by a country mile\", but they still did not \"deserve to be singles\". Whitney Matheson of USA Today called it similar to the works of Sister Sledge, Destiny's Child and Nu Shooz songs, writing that, \"while the No Scrubs-y vibe briefly tempted me to shout a dirty word and bare my navel, styrofoam phrases such as 'Don't be afraid to play my game' are more Teletubby than T-Boz.\" Arion Berger of The Washington Post compared the track to \"catching your little sister making out with some guy at the mall\". In a review for the album, the Lincoln Journal Star staff considered that \"attempts at uptempo, funky sounds\" such as \"Holler\" \"fall flat almost instantly\". Retrospective reviews for the single have also been mixed. Will Stroude of Attitude considered the track \"funky, attitude-filled\", but acknowledged that retrospective reviews of the song \"haven\u2019t always been kind, but they make the mistake of defining the era based on the cultural craze that had come before, rather than taking it on its own terms\", but asserted that \"connoisseurs know that \u2018Holler\u2019 still slaps almost two decades later.\" While reviewing their Greatest Hits album, Nick Levine of Digital Spy stated that \"Jerkins' slick, stuttering R&B numbers\" from Forever, which included \"Holler\", failed to capitalise on the group's \"very British sense of mischief\". According to The Guardian's Alexis Petridis, Jerkins was a \"great signing\" as producer, although his \"more avant tendencies\" were \"hemmed in by the necessity of making Spice Girls records with direct pop appeal\"; hence, he described \"Holler\" as \"serviceable, rather than thrilling\". Dom Passantino of Stylus Magazine rated the single 3\/10, saying the song is his \"personal pick for the worst production job in musical history, ol' Darkchild took the most unique, epoch-defining, cultural maelstrom of a group he could find, and turned them into a facsimile of Fanmail-era TLC.\" Tom Ewing of e-zine Freaky Trigger said the song \"shifts and shuffles in a competent, modish way\", but criticized the group and the producer for \"not trying to change any games\". He also described the intro as sounding dated: \"Like 'Holler' needed to sound any more 2000.\"","h_score":1649626.5250000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":88411,"revid":1173275805,"description":"2000 single by Spice Girls","categories":["1999 songs","2000 singles","British contemporary R&B songs","Music videos directed by Jake Nava","Number-one singles in Scotland","Song recordings produced by Rodney Jerkins","Songs written by Emma Bunton","Songs written by Fred Jerkins III","Songs written by LaShawn Daniels","Songs written by Mel B","Songs written by Melanie C","Songs written by Rodney Jerkins","Songs written by Victoria Beckham","Spice Girls songs","UK Singles Chart number-one singles","Virgin Records singles"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's \"Holler\" by the Spice Girls?  \nA1: It's a funky pop anthem from their 2000 album Forever, marking a shift to a more mature sound with sultry beats and confident lyrics.\n\nQ2: Who wrote the song?  \nA2: The Spice Girls co-wrote it with producers Rodney Jerkins and Jimmy Jam, blending their playful energy with R&B flair for a fresh twist.\n\nQ3: When was it released?  \nA3: \"Holler\" dropped in October 2000 as a double A-side single with \"Let Love Lead the Way,\" capturing the group's evolution amid Y2K vibes.\n\nQ4: How did it chart?  \nA4: It hit number one in the UK and topped charts in several countries, proving the Spice Girls' enduring spice even post-Geri's return.\n\nQ5: What's the song's theme?  \nA5: \"Holler\" explores empowerment and seduction, with vivid imagery of bold femininity, diverging from their earlier bubbly hits into deeper emotional layers.\n\nQ6: How does it differ from their early work?  \nA6: Unlike the upbeat \"Wannabe,\" it features smoother R&B influences and less group harmony, reflecting their growth as artists in a whirlwind pop world.\n\nQ7: What was the music video like?  \nA7: The video shows the ladies in glamorous, desert-inspired outfits, dancing with fiery passion, adding a cinematic edge to their signature girl-power narrative.\n\nQ8: Why is it memorable today?  \nA8: As a bridge to their later era, \"Holler\" symbolizes resilience and reinvention, still evoking nostalgia with its unexpected grooves in the Spice legacy."}

Libbie suffered a stroke the next month, and she died in Wisconsin two months after. During her illness in Houston, Holt wrote a new will for her, naming himself as sole executor and designating ten percent of the proceeds as his commission, which was witnessed only by two of his in-laws. The 1896 will assumed \\$2 million in community property, and designated \\$200,000 to Huntington, and another \\$150,000 to Huntington's close relations. Rice had not known about any of his wife's wills, but he was so informed by Baker in September. Two weeks later Baker drew a new will for Rice, which bequeathed the bulk of his estate to the foundation for the Institute for the Advancement of Literature, Science, and Art. Along with Judge John Bartine, Baker was an executor. Holt filed Libbie's 1896 will in Harris County on March 22, 1897. Baker and his firm represented Rice. Holt prevailed in the probate hearing as the judge admitted the will and accepted Holt as executor. Holt filed lawsuits in four counties, asserting Libbie's community property interests in those places. Baker filed an appeal against the probate hearing and lost. He next moved with a counter-suit in federal court, claiming that Holt had no standing to file for the estate since the Rices never established Texas as their residence. The laws of New York should apply, Baker argued, which was not a community property state. The U.S. Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Texas consolidated all of the lawsuits and moved them to federal jurisdiction. Over the next two years, Baker interviewed witnesses to the Rice marriage in Houston and New York in preparation for the impending case. The trial was scheduled for early October.","h_score":1655974.01875,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":14775129,"revid":1166520818,"description":"American lawyer and banker","categories":["1857 births","1941 deaths","American Presbyterians","American bankers","Burials at Glenwood Cemetery (Houston, Texas)","Business executives","Businesspeople from Houston","Lawyers from Houston","Military personnel from Texas","People associated with Baker Botts","People from Huntsville, Texas","Rice University people","Rice University trustees","Trustees of charities"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was James A.

In 1962, he joined Cardiff City for \u00a318,000, where he spent three seasons before finishing his professional career with a second spell with Swansea Town. His two spells with Swansea saw him become the club's all-time top goalscorer.\n\nDuring his career, Allchurch won a total of 68 caps for Wales, a record which stood until 1986 when it was exceeded by Joey Jones. He also jointly held the record number of goals scored for Wales, along with Trevor Ford, 23, which was eventually broken by Ian Rush. His talents were more widely recognised after his performance for Wales during the 1958 World Cup, in which he scored twice and helped them to reach the quarter-finals. His brother Len was also a footballer and the pair played alongside each other for Wales on several occasions.\n\n","h_score":1678091.15625,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":1110987,"revid":1164401110,"description":"Welsh footballer","categories":["1929 births","1958 FIFA World Cup players","1997 deaths","20th-century British Army personnel","Cardiff City F.C. players","English Football Hall of Fame inductees","English Football League players","Footballers from Swansea","Haverfordwest County A.F.C. managers","Haverfordwest County A.F.C. players","Members of the Order of the British Empire","Men's association football inside forwards","Newcastle United F.C. players","Pontardawe Town F.C. managers","Royal Artillery soldiers","Swansea City A.F.C. players","Wales men's international footballers","Welsh football managers","Welsh men's footballers","Welsh people of English descent","Worcester City F.C. players"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Ivor Allchurch?  \nA1: Ivor Allchurch was a Welsh football legend, nicknamed the Golden Boy for his dazzling skills.\n\nQ2: When and where was he born?  \nA2: Born in 1929 in Swansea, Wales, he rose from humble roots to football fame.\n\nQ3: What clubs did he play for?  \nA3: He starred for Swansea Town, Newcastle United, and others, weaving magic on the pitch.\n\nQ4: What were his major achievements?  \nA4: Allchurch netted over 250 goals, helping Wales qualify for the 1958 World Cup with flair.\n\nQ5: How did he impact Welsh football?  \nA5: As a striker, he embodied Welsh pride, scoring crucial goals that echoed through history.\n\nQ6: What was his playing style like?  \nA6: Known for elegant dribbles and precise shots, he danced past defenders like a poet on grass.\n\nQ7: Did he have any nicknames?  \nA7: Yes, the Golden Boy captured his radiant talent, a beacon in post-war British football.\n\nQ8: What's his legacy today?  \nA8: Allchurch inspires young players, his story a vivid tapestry of skill and national spirit."}

Trust instruments should ideally identify that the money is to be used for \"charitable purposes\". The use of other words such as \"beneficial\" or \"benevolent\" causes the trust to fail at creation, as the words are not synonymous with charity. An example is the Privy Council decision in Attorney General of the Cayman Islands v Wahr-Hansen, where the Council held that gifts to \"organisations or institutions operating for the public good\" and acting \"for the good or for the benefit of mankind\" failed, because the definition given was not exclusively charitable.\n\nThere are two exceptions to the rule of exclusivity; ancillary purposes, and severance. Where the non-charitable purpose is a necessary ancillary to the charitable one, the trust will not fail. This is a matter of degrees, and was discussed by Slade J in McGovern v Attorney General, when he said that:\n\n> The distinction is between (a) those non-charitable activities authorised by the trust instrument which are merely incidental or subsidiary to a charitable purpose and (b) those non-charitable activities so authorised which themselves form part of the trust purpose. In the latter but not the former case the reference to non-charitable activities will deprive the trust of its charitable status.\n\nSeverance refers to the separation of charitable and non-charitable purposes, dividing the funds between them. This allows the charitable element to take effect. This is only possible when the trust instrument indicates that the donor intended for the fund to be divided, and cannot work where the donor gives a list of purposes a single fund is to be used for. The standard rule for dividing the funds is based on the equitable rule that \"equity is equality\"; money should be divided equally. There are exceptions where it is not practicable, as in Re Coxon, where of a \u00a3200,000 gift to the City of London for charitable purposes, a \u00a3100 dinner and other small gifts to the board of trustees was funded.\n\n ## Administration of charitable trusts\n\nThe administration of charitable trusts is covered primarily by the Charities Act 1993 and the Charities Act 2006, and is widely divided between four groups; the Attorney General for England and Wales, the trustees, the Charity Commission and the Official Custodian for Charities.\n\n ### Attorney General and trustees\n\nAs mentioned, the Attorney General represents the beneficiaries as a parens patriae, appearing on the part of The Crown. Any case involving charities has him joined as a party, he may act against trustees in disputes, and take actions to recover property from third parties. His role was discussed in Brooks v Richardson, where the court quoted the practitioner's text Tudor on Charity:\n\n> By reason of his duty as the Sovereign's representative protecting all the persons interested in the charity funds, the Attorney-General is as a general rule a necessary party to charity proceeding. He represents the beneficial interest; it follows that in all proceedings in which the beneficial interest has to be before the court, he must be a party. He represents all the objects of the charity, who are in effect parties through him.\n\nThe next significant role is played by the charity trustees, defined in Section 97 of the 1993 Act as those persons having the general control and management of the administration of charities. As mentioned, charitable trustees have significantly more freedom to act than normal trustees, but the 1993 Act has put restrictions on who may be a charitable trustee. Section 72 excludes people convicted of a crime involving dishonesty, bankrupts, people previously removed from charity trusteeship, and people struck off as directors of companies. Those trustees appointed have many duties when administering the trust, including informing the Commission of changes to the charity or its dissolution, registering the charity and keeping proper accounts and records, to be submitted annually to the Commission.\n\n ### Charity Commission\n\nThe Charity Commission originated as the Charity Commissioners, created by the Charitable Trusts Act 1853 to provide advice to charitable trusts. Currently governed by and exercising its functions under the Charities Act 2011, it has five core objectives:\n\nAlong with these objectives, it has six functions under the 2011 Act:\n\nThe Charity Commission has the power to issue an inquiry into a charity under Section 46 of the 2011 act and, if they are satisfied there has been mismanagement, they are allowed to suspend trustees or officers, appoint additional trustees, vest charity property in the Official Custodian for Charities or order debtors or people holding charity property not to transfer it without their permission. They can also remove trustees on the grounds of bankruptcy, mental incapacity, failure to act or the trustee's absence from the country. The Commission is also authorised to appoint new trustees to replace removed ones, or even to increase the number of trustees.\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Charity Commission is concurrent with that of the High Court of Justice. The High Court possesses all the powers of the Commission, who only exercise theirs on application of the charity or Attorney General, or trustees, beneficiaries and interested people when the charity has an income of less than \u00a3500. The Commission, under Section 29 of the 2011 Act, also keeps the register of charities. Under Section 110 of the Act, the Commission is tasked with giving advice or opinions to trustees relating to the performance or administration of their charity. The Commission also acts as the Official Custodian for Charities, who acts as a trustee for charities at the direction of the Commission.\n\n ### Schemes\n\nBoth the High Court and the Charities Commission are authorised to establish schemes administering charities. These can come about when money has been left for a charitable purpose which is not specified, or with no suggestion as to how it should be administered. The scheme may be used to appoint new trustees, except when the trustee's identity is crucial to the intentions of the testator, as in Re Lysaght. Schemes may also be used to fix administrative difficulties caused by uncertainty, as in Re Gott, or even to completely defeat the gift. Schemes can also be used, on the application of trustees, to extend powers of investment or consolidate funds. The trustees may apply to change the core purpose of the trust, which while enacted through a scheme, follows the doctrine of Cy-pr\u00e8s.\n\n","h_score":1684854.8875000002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":27465402,"revid":1172805399,"description":"Express trusts dedicated to charitable goals under English law","categories":["Charitable trusts","Charities based in England and Wales","Charity law","English trusts law"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Charitable Trusts: The Unsung Heroes of English Giving\n\nIn English law, charitable trusts are clever legal tools that lock away assets for public good, like a treasure chest for society\u2019s woes, blending altruism with strict rules.

Poole visited Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Drake and Marquette as a blue chip high school basketball recruit. Then, he visited Michigan for the September 26 football game between the 2015 Wolverines and BYU, receiving an offer that weekend. He returned to campus on October 17 for the rivalry game against Michigan State. On October 23, 2015, four-star recruit Poole became the first commitment for the Class of 2017 after a home gym visit from head coach John Beilein and assistant coach LaVall Jordan and multiple Michigan campus visits. Poole had several competing offers including Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, Memphis, Marquette, Virginia Tech and Auburn. At the time of his commitment, he was the 2nd-ranked overall prospect and the 1st-ranked shooting guard in the national class of 2017. As a junior, Poole was a 2016 WBCA All-State Boys Basketball first team selection.\n\nOn July 1, 2016, Poole announced that he would transfer from Rufus King to La Lumiere School in Indiana for his senior year, where he would experience a campus lifestyle, play a schedule with several ESPN broadcasts, and be teamed up with then-unsigned class of 2017 prospects Brian Bowen and Jeremiah Tilmon. By the time Poole signed his letter of intent to play college basketball for Michigan as part of a three-scholarship player incoming class with Isaiah Livers and Eli Brooks on November 11, 2016, he was the 90th-ranked overall prospect. Poole was a member of the 2017 Dick's National High School Champion La Lumiere team. In the Dick's National Championship game, Poole posted 13 points, three steals, three rebounds and four assists, and shot 3\u20137 on his three-point shots. The 13 points included a shot clock buzzer beater in the closing seconds of the third quarter. La Lumiere, which included 2017 McDonald's All-Americans Bowen and Jaren Jackson Jr., defeated perennial power Montverde Academy, who was led by Canadian sophomore R. J. Barrett.

Other than Clacton, the Butlins camps were relatively unscathed, and even Clacton, which had been damaged by troop occupation, re-opened in early 1946. In the post-war boom Butlin saw opportunities on foreign shores. He opened camps at Mosney, in the soon to be Republic of Ireland, in 1948 and on Grand Bahama, in 1949.\n\nIn most ways Mosney was identical to the existing successful camps, but in Ireland this was something that was seen to be feared, rather than embraced. A number of complaints appeared in the Catholic Standard, warning that holiday camps were an English idea that were undesirable in Catholic Ireland. Like the other camps, Mosney was designed to have a church and reassurances were given that it would be a Catholic chapel with a resident priest. Reassurances were also given that Irish nationals would have priority over British tourists in booking holidays. In July 1948 the camp was opened by William Norton, the Minister for Social Welfare, and it operated successfully as a Butlin's camp until the early 1980s.\n\nA more ambitious plan by Butlin was conceived on a trip to The Bahamas in 1946. Seeing potential for a camp in warmer climes, he formed a company under the chairmanship of Sir Bede Edmund Hugh Clifford and bought land in Grand Bahama. Butlin also purchased the Princess Hotel in Bermuda and the Fort Montagu beach hotel in Nassau. The camp was intended to be complete and open on New Years Day of 1950. After an investment of US\\$5 million (2011:\u00a3Expression error: Unexpected \\* operator) the camp opened, still only partially complete, in the winter of 1949. To celebrate its opening, Butlin ran a mystery flight, where guests, who had paid \\$129 (2011:\u00a3Expression error: Unexpected \\* operator) each, were taken on a flight to the resort without being informed in advance. Butlin did not celebrate for long; he required a further \\$2.25 million (2011:\u00a3Expression error: Unexpected \\* operator) to complete the camp, and American tourists unaccustomed to the holiday camp concept had little interest. In an attempt to save the camp, Butlin sold the hotel leases to an American firm. By November 1950, the subsidiary company handling the Caribbean resort was ordered to be wound up by a court. Butlin admitted defeat and focused his efforts back in Europe. In the late 1940s Butlin successfully opened hotels outside the Skegness and Ayr camps, so he now saw his opportunity to expand into this market. Butlin began acquiring hotels in Saltdean, Blackpool and Cliftonville.\n\n","h_score":1640490.2375,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":812451,"revid":1173561624,"description":"British, South Africa-born entrepreneur","categories":["1899 births","1980 deaths","20th-century British businesspeople","British hospitality businesspeople","Businesspeople from Cape Town","Businesspeople from Toronto","Butlins","Canadian Expeditionary Force soldiers","English emigrants to Canada","Freemasons of the United Grand Lodge of England","Knights Bachelor","Members of the Order of the British Empire","People from Stroud District","People in greyhound racing","South African emigrants to the United Kingdom","South African people of English descent"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Billy Butlin?  \nA1: Billy Butlin was a British entrepreneur born in 1899.

Recent developments following the Bosnian Crisis, such as Italy's announced naval expansion, the construction of the new Italian dreadnought battleship Dante Alighieri, and the modernization of Italy's torpedo flotilla all led Montecuccoli to warn the Emperor that the navy would be unable to protect Austria-Hungary's coastline, barring the \"urgent and quickest possible completion\" of his naval expansion program. This program included four proposed Tegetthoff-class battleships, the three Novara-class cruisers, six destroyers, 12 torpedo boats, six submarines, and four river monitors to patrol the Danube. Montecuccoli's plans were to cost 330 million Kronen and would be completed by 1915.\n\nThe Emperor supported this proposal and his support, combined with that of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the Austrian Naval League, were sufficient for Montecuccoli to obtain the necessary funds he needed from the Austrian and Hungarian delegations in December 1910. By this time, some of the dreadnought battleships in his plan, Viribus Unitis and Tegetthoff, had already been laid down, effectively forcing the hand of the remaining members of the Austro-Hungarian government who opposed Montecuccoli's project. The final version of Montecuccoli's proposal included a slight modification, with the build range for the ships expanding to 1916, and the final cost being brought down to 312.4 million Kronen. Despite heated debate among the deputies, including an attempt to kill the proposal outright and initiate talks with Italy to end the growing arms race between Austria-Hungary and its nominal ally, the vast majority of both the Austrian and Hungarian delegations supported Montecuccoli's plan to expand the navy.\n\nAt a meeting before Austria-Hungary's common Ministerial Council on 5 January 1911, Montecuccoli justified the construction of the Novara-class cruisers by arguing that a class of light or scout cruisers were necessary for operations in the Adriatic Sea, and that their design would enable them to operate in the Mediterranean Sea as well if required. The final price for the ships of the Novara class, tentatively labeled \"Cruiser G\", \"Cruiser H\", and \"Cruiser J\", was to be 30 million Kronen, or 10 million per ship. By February, the final political hurdles had been cleared and the contract for the first cruiser of the class, \"Cruiser G\", was awarded to Cantiere Navale Triestino in Monfalcone. In April 1911, the contracts for \"Cruiser H\" and \"Cruiser J\" were awarded to Ganz-Danubius in Fiume.\n\n","h_score":1661222.0875000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":57729635,"revid":1159675374,"description":"Scout cruiser class of the Austro-Hungarian Navy","categories":["Cruiser classes","Novara-class cruisers","Ship classes of the French Navy"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the Novara-class cruiser?  \nA1: The Novara-class consists of light cruisers built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy around 1913, sleek vessels designed for speed and scouting.\n\nQ2: Who designed and built them?  \nA2: Designed by the Austro-Hungarian Navy's engineers, they were constructed at shipyards like Ganz & Co., blending innovation with imperial might.\n\nQ3: What were their key features?  \nA3: These cruisers boasted high speeds over 26 knots, light armor, and armaments including 10cm guns, making them agile predators of the seas.\n\nQ4: When were they launched?  \nA4: Launched between 1912 and 1914, they entered service just before World War I, ready to patrol Europe's turbulent waters.\n\nQ5: What roles did they play in war?  \nA5: They served in reconnaissance and escort duties, notably in the Adriatic, where their swift maneuvers helped in key naval skirmishes.\n\nQ6: How did they compare to other cruisers?  \nA6: Lighter and faster than many contemporaries like British light cruisers, they excelled in hit-and-run tactics but lacked heavy firepower.\n\nQ7: What happened to them after the war?  \nA7: Post-1918, most were ceded as war prizes and scrapped, though one lingered in service, fading like echoes of empire.\n\nQ8: What is their historical legacy?  \nA8: As symbols of Austro-Hungarian naval prowess, they influenced interwar designs, their stories still rippling through maritime history books."}

Hyatt","reference":"Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt (short: Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Hyatt or Hyatt III), 587 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case that determined that unless they consent, states have sovereign immunity from private suits filed against them in the courts of another state. The 5\u20134 decision overturned precedent set in a 1979 Supreme Court case, Nevada v. Hall. This was the third time that the litigants had presented their case to the Court, as the Court had already ruled on the issue in 2003 and 2016.\n\nThe ruling ended a long tax dispute between Gilbert Hyatt and California regarding alleged tax fraud by Hyatt. Hyatt had been challenging the tax fraud penalties that the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) had ordered him to pay since 1993, both in court and through administrative proceedings. Because of the Supreme Court ruling, Hyatt was required to pay for all legal costs he incurred, without receiving a judgement against the FTB. On this matter, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote: \"The consequences for the inventor are that he'll suffer the loss of two decades of litigation expenses and a final judgment against the Board for its egregious conduct. ...

He became bishop of Lichfield in 779. At a Mercian council he attended that year at Hartleford he was styled \"electus praesul\", or \"bishop elect\". Two years later he witnessed a charter of Offa's concerning an ecclesiastical claim on a church in Worcester.\n\nPerhaps as early as 786 the creation of a Mercian archbishopric was being discussed at Offa's court. A letter to the papacy written by Coenwulf, who succeeded Offa's son Ecgfrith to the Mercian throne, claimed that Offa's motives were his dislike of J\u00e6nberht, the archbishop of Canterbury, and of the men of Kent. At the Council of Chelsea held in 787, Offa secured the creation of an archbishopric for his kingdom centred on the diocese of Lichfield (in modern Staffordshire). Offa may have justified the move by suggesting that J\u00e6nberht planned to allow the Frankish king Charlemagne to use a landing site in Kent if the latter decided to invade, although this is only known from a 13th-century writer, Matthew Paris. Another concern was probably that of prestige, as having the main Mercian diocese held by an archbishop rather than a bishop would increase the kingdom's status.\n\nAn archbishopric in Mercia would also reinforce the kingdom's independence and free it from ecclesiastical dependence on Canterbury in the kingdom of Kent, which Offa had recently brought under Mercian control. J\u00e6nberht supported the Kentish king Egbert II, who was not known as a firm supporter of Offa's; an archbishop at Canterbury who was either indifferent or in active opposition to Offa would be an impediment to Offa's ability to establish overlordship of Kent and other areas of England. By elevating another archbishop, Offa would reduce the political power of the archbishops of Canterbury. Elevation of a bishopric to an archbishopric was not unprecedented; in 735 the papacy had elevated another Anglo-Saxon bishopric to an archbishopric, when Ecgbert became the first archbishop of York.\n\n","h_score":1684733.9625000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":3637965,"revid":1161976711,"description":"8th-century Archbishop of Lichfield","categories":["8th-century archbishops","9th-century deaths","Anglo-Saxon bishops of Lichfield","Year of birth unknown"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Hygeberht: The Archbishop Who Upended Medieval Power\n\nIn the misty annals of 8th-century England, Hygeberht rose as Archbishop of Lichfield, courtesy of King Offa's cunning maneuvers.

Some said the game did not try to be more than a good time, and described it as a variant of \"ridiculous\", \"zany\", or \"absurd\". In another way, others called it \"juvenile\". Critics praised the degree of customization options, and had mixed views of the array of activities, but found Professor Genki's Super Ethical Reality Climax a high point. Some found the game's ironic sexism to verge on misogyny, and that its other humor sometimes fell flat. Several critics referred to the game as the perfection of the Saints Row formula It was a nominee for Best Narrative at the 2012 Game Developers Conference, an IGN Editor's Choice, and a recipient of perfect scores from GamesRadar and G4. Edge said that the series \"wants to be the WarioWare of open-city games\", \"a cartoon flipbook of anything-goes extremity\" to Grand Theft Auto's \"ostentatious crime drama\". They wrote that the game's \"single-minded\" \"puerile imagination\" demanded respect and noted the game's escalation of video game tropes and cultural references from Japanese game shows to text adventures to zombie apocalypses to lucha libre. IGN's Daemon Hatfield called the game \"an open world adult theme park\". He said that calling it \"a good time would be a severe understatement\" and praised its method of incentivizing almost every action in the game as \"fantastic game design\". Hatfield was \"addicted\" to efficiently expanding his in-game hourly income. GamesRadar's Michael Grimm wrote Saints Row: The Third was nearly surreal, and praised the player-character's running attacks. Referring to the historical comparison between the Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto series, Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer wrote that Grand Theft Auto IV's serious turn let the Saints Row series be a \"gleeful silly sandbox game\", and noted that Saints Row: The Third was \"marketed almost exclusively\" based on its wackiness, from the costumes to the sex toy weapons. He felt that the \"wacky hijinks\" quickly became \"predictable and repetitive\" and the activities felt \"sanitized and generic\". Edge wrote that they were \"one-off gags\". Eurogamer's Whitehead added that the tiger escort Guardian Angel missions appeared to draw from Will Ferrell's Talladega Nights, and that the Prof. Genki's Super Ethical Reality Climax shooting gallery drew from Bizarre Creations' The Club shooter. Eurogamer and PC Gamer both found the game easy. Ryan McCaffrey of Official Xbox Magazine thought that the game resolved some of the problems of open world design and thus allowed for an experience with good times and no filler, such as Burnout-style arrows on the streets instead of hidden in the minimap GPS.

Hilton still reported a loss on the year, albeit a greatly reduced one of between \\$250,000 and \\$300,000.\n\nOn the field, the Chargers repeated as Western Division champions, this time with a 12\u20132 record, before losing to the Oilers in the title game for the second straight year. They retained many of their offensive stars from the 1960 season. Kemp again ranked second in the league for passing yardage (2,686), but his completion percentage fell below 50%, and he threw only 15 touchdowns against 22 interceptions. Only 4 of these interceptions came in the first seven games of the season, against 18 in the next seven; he threw another 4 in the AFL title game. While Lowe didn't quite match his impact of the previous season, he still ranked 4th in the league for rushing yards (767), and joint first for rushing touchdowns (nine). Kocourek became the club's first 1,000 yard receiver with 55 catches for 1,055 yards, while Don Norton added 47 catches and 816 yards.\n\nOn defense, the 1961 Chargers set a modern-era pro football record with 66 takeaways, the most in AFL or NFL history (the 1946 Cleveland Browns recorded one more during an AAFC season). The Chargers also recorded the most interceptions returned for a touchdown in both league histories with nine, and the most total interceptions with 49. All three of these record still stand as of 2022. Charlie McNeil led the team with nine interceptions, which stood as a club record until Antonio Cromartie broke it 46 years later. Bob Zeman had eight interceptions and Dick Harris had seven, returning three for touchdowns (still a club record as of 2022). By contrast, only one Charger managed more than six interceptions in a season throughout the entire 1970s (Bryant Salter, 1972). Defensive end Ron Nery is unofficially credited with 8 quarterback sacks, again leading the team. Beyond Nery, the defensive line saw an overhaul, with rookies Faison, Bill Hudson and Ladd starting every game. Middle linebacker Allen and cornerback Claude Gibson, also new draftees, saw significant action. Another rookie, George Blair, doubled up as defensive back and kicker. His field-goal-conversion percentage was below 50% (he made 13 of 27), but still third best in the league, as was Paul Maguire's average of 41.5 yards per punt.\n\nLinebacker Bob Laraba had five interceptions and scored three touchdowns, including one on offense. He died in a car accident shortly after the season ended, at the age of 28.\n\n ### Schedule\n\n ### Game summaries\n\n #### Week 1: at Dallas Texans\n\nIn their first game of the season, San Diego capitalized on six takeaways and a pair of long runs to defeat their closest divisional rivals from the previous season. Following an exchange of punts, Lowe benefited from a key Ron Mix block as he broke away for an 87-yard touchdown. It set a club record for longest run that has since been tied, but not surpassed as of 2022. Blair missed the extra point, but kicked a pair of field goals in the first half, while Allen, Faison and McNeil each intercepted Dallas quarterback Cotton Davidson.\n\nThe Texans scored for the first time with a field goal early in the 4th quarter; they then recovered a Kemp fumble in Charger territory, but Gibson ended the threat with an interception. On the next Texans possession, Emil Karas recovered a fumble at the Dallas 14-yard line. Laraba then came in as quarterback, a role he played occasionally during his career; Laraba ran the ball himself on four of the next six plays, and scored from the 1-yard line. Roberson broke away for a 53-yard touchdown run late in the game, and the lone Dallas touchdown came too late to make a difference.\n\nLowe had no further breakaways after his touchdown run, but still finished with 100 yards from 13 carries.\n\n #### Week 2: vs. Oakland Raiders\n\nThe Chargers' first game in their new city proved a success, as they dominated their Californian rivals throughout. Oakland had lost their opener 55\u20130, and fared only slightly better here; on the third play of the game, Harris intercepted a Tom Flores pass and returned it 41 yards for a touchdown. The Raiders' best chance to score came on their next drive, when they reached the Charger 26 but missed a field goal. On the ensuing drive, San Diego drove 80 yards the other way, and Lowe swept around the left end for a 2-yard score.\n\nRoberson and Charlie Flowers rushed for two touchdowns each, giving San Diego a total of five for the game, a franchise record since tied multiple times (including the next game against the Raiders) but not surpassed as of 2022. Five different players had interceptions, and the Chargers forced six turnovers to none, while outgaining the Raiders in total offensive yards, 386\u2013106. Oakland crossed midfield only twice in 12 total possessions.\n\n #### Week 3: vs. Houston Oilers\n\nMcNeil had a record-breaking performance as the Chargers won a rematch of the 1960 AFL Championship Game. Houston were threatening to break a 3\u20133 tie in the 2nd quarter when McNeil intercepted a George Blanda pass at his own 7-yard line, and returned it for 76 yards up the right sideline. Kemp then converted a 4th and inches with a quarterback sneak, before hitting Kocourek for a 7-yard touchdown. Blanda's next pass was intercepted at the line of scrimmage by Faison, and Lowe scored within three plays to double the lead. Next, McNeil took a third interception all the way back for a 76-yard touchdown, before Blanda was picked off for the fourth time, by McNeil, and Luther Hayes had a 37-yard scoring catch to make it 31\u20133 at the break.\n\nHouston tried backup QB Jacky Lee after halftime. He managed three touchdowns, but also threw two further interceptions and lost a fumble; the Chargers had little difficulty in keeping Houston at bay. One of the interceptions was by McNeil, who finished the game with 177 interception return yards, still an AFL\/NFL record as of 2023. San Diego had intercepted 15 passes from 6 different quarterbacks in the first three weeks. This continuing defensive success covered up an indifferent offensive display, which saw the Chargers gain 158 yards and earn just seven first downs.\n\n #### Week 4: at Buffalo Bills\n\nIn contrast to the recent glut of takeaways, the Chargers only had two in this game, but both were significant. Only three plays into the game, Harris had his second interception-return touchdown of the season, this one covering 56 yards and putting the Chargers ahead to stay. Later in the opening quarter, Kemp was sacked to bring up a 3rd and 14, but responded with a 16-yard scramble to keep the drive going. Lowe broke off a 30-yard touchdown run three plays later, making it 13\u20130. Buffalo responded with field-goal attempts on their next three drives, though only the first was successful. Shortly before halftime Kemp threw an interception on 1st and 10; the Bills scored a play later and added a two-point conversion, making it 13\u201311 heading into halftime.\n\nSan Diego controlled the clock in the third quarter, running 23 plays to the Bills' 3, and scoring through Blair field goals on both their drives. After Buffalo missed a field goal, the Bills' offense had one more chance, starting at their own 8-yard line. They picked up three first downs, and reached a 3rd and 11 near midfield, before Faison recovered a fumble to end the threat. Lowe then picked up a first down, and San Diego ran out the clock. Lowe carried 22 times on the day, for 128 yards and a touchdown.\n\n","h_score":1644343.08125,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":15428670,"revid":1164306925,"description":"2nd season in franchise history, first in San Diego","categories":["1961 American Football League season by team","1961 in sports in California","San Diego Chargers seasons"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What league did the San Diego Chargers play in during 1961?  \nA1: The American Football League (AFL).  \n\nQ2: Who was the head coach?  \nA2: Sid Gillman.  \n\nQ3: What was their regular season record?  \nA3: 12 wins and 2 losses.  \n\nQ4: Did they win their division?  \nA4: Yes, the AFL Western Division.  \n\nQ5: Who were key players?  \nA5: Quarterback Tobin Rote and defensive end Earl Faison.  \n\nQ6: What happened in the AFL Championship Game?  \nA6: They lost to the Houston Oilers, 10-3.  \n\nQ7: How did this season impact the team?  \nA7: It boosted their AFL profile and fan base.  \n\nQ8: What is the legacy of the 1961 season?  \nA8: Marked their first division title and rising competitiveness."}

These documents appeared to show that the centre was operating as a de facto embassy and advising businesses about how to evade sanctions. For instance, the documents showed that the Rhodesian government referred to it as a \"mission\", using the same terminology as it applied to the overt diplomatic posts in Portugal and South Africa. Other documents provided examples of how the RIC was attempting to influence politicians and journalists, including by offering free trips to Rhodesia, and indicated extensive collaboration with the far-right Australian League of Rights. The documents also demonstrated that the South African Embassy in Canberra had violated customs regulations by importing Rhodesian films and propaganda on behalf of the centre. The Age and The Review published several stories about these revelations. The director of the RIC \"emphatically denied\" that it had smuggled publicity material into Australia or been involved in intelligence-gathering activities. The South African Ambassador, John Mills, also issued a statement denying that his staff had done anything improper. In response to the media coverage, the Australian government directed the Department of Foreign Affairs to investigate the possible violation of customs regulations. Customs officers also raided the centre. The Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Customs and Excise found that the material stolen from the RIC demonstrated that it was run by the Rhodesian government. The Department of Foreign Affairs recommended that the centre be closed, but the government decided to not take any action. The Minister for Foreign Affairs Nigel Bowen stated on 11 April 1972 that the government did not have the legal authority to close the centre. Richard V. Hall attributed this decision to the influence of the \"Rhodesia Lobby\" and an editorial in The Age stated that the government's lack of action \"showed clearly \u2013 all too clearly \u2013 where its sympathies lay\". During a parliamentary debate on racism and violence in May 1972 the federal opposition leader Gough Whitlam criticised the government for not closing the centre. Minister for Customs and Excise Don Chipp believed that the affair was the result of overly strict regulations on importing works from Rhodesia as he considered some of the material found to have violated the ban to be inoffensive. He gained the Cabinet's agreement for the regulations to be reviewed so that they would be enforced \"with common sense\" in the future. The Department of Foreign Affairs was unhappy with this outcome, as it believed that relaxing the regulations would reinforce the international perception that Australia was not serious about enforcing sanctions against Rhodesia. Bowen concurred, and told Chipp that easing the regulations would help the Rhodesian regime disseminate propaganda in Australia. In July 1972 the government announced that it would not renew the Australian passports that had been issued to the head of the Rhodesian Ministry of External Affairs and the Rhodesian representatives in Portugal and South Africa on the grounds that they were working for a government that Australia did not recognise. As part of a collection of official documents published in 2017, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade historian Matthew Jordan stated that the government's failure to act against the Rhodesia Information Centre in 1972 after its illegal activities had been revealed demonstrated its \"residual sympathy\" for the white Rhodesians. He also judged that Chipp's response to the revelations \"was symptomatic of the Australian Government's half-hearted commitment to the long-term objective of overturning the white minority regime in Salisbury\". ### Whitlam government\n\n","h_score":1642718.95625,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":68540215,"revid":1173921443,"description":"De facto embassy in Australia (1966\u20131980)","categories":["1966 establishments in Australia","1980 disestablishments in Australia","Australia and the Commonwealth of Nations","Australia\u2013Zimbabwe relations","De facto embassies","Diplomatic missions in Australia","Foreign relations of Rhodesia","History of the foreign relations of Australia","Political history of Australia","Propaganda organizations","Zimbabwe and the Commonwealth of Nations"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the Rhodesia Information Centre?  \nA1: It was an information bureau established by Rhodesia to promote its perspectives abroad.  \n\nQ2: When and where was it founded?  \nA2: It was created in the 1960s, mainly in London and other international cities.  \n\nQ3: What was its primary purpose?  \nA3: The centre aimed to counter negative publicity and share Rhodesian viewpoints.  \n\nQ4: Who operated it?  \nA4: It was run by Rhodesian government officials and supporters.  \n\nQ5: How did it function?  \nA5: It distributed materials like pamphlets and held events to influence opinions.  \n\nQ6: What role did it play in international relations?  \nA6: It sought to build support from sympathetic nations during Rhodesia's isolation.  \n\nQ7: Were there controversies?  \nA7: Yes, it faced criticism for alleged propaganda and misinformation efforts.  \n\nQ8: What is its legacy today?  \nA8: It represents colonial-era information warfare, influencing modern discussions on Zimbabwe's history."}

The bill of sale records that the property included \"... houses, tobacco houses (tobacco barns), stables, gardens, and orchards.\"\n\nBy the late 1750s, Hampton extended to more than 10,000 acres (4,000 ha) and included an ironworks. His son, Capt. Charles Ridgely (1733\u201390), expanded the family business considerably to include gristmills, apple orchards, and stone quarries. During the American Revolutionary War, the ironworks was a significant source of income for the Ridgelys, producing cannons and ammunition for the Continental Army. In 1783, Capt. Ridgely began construction of the main house, Hampton Mansion. He said its concept was inspired by Castle Howard in England, owned by relatives of his mother. When it was completed in 1790, the Hampton Mansion was the largest private home in the United States.\n\nWhen Capt. Ridgely died that same year, his nephew, Charles Carnan Ridgely (1760\u20131829), became the second master of Hampton. He had 10,590 feet (3,228 m) of irrigation pipes laid in 1799 from a nearby spring to provide water to the Mansion and the surrounding gardens, which he was extensively developing. Prominent artisans of the time were hired to design geometric formal gardens, which were planted on the Mansion's grounds between 1799 and 1801. An avid horseman, Charles Carnan also began raising Thoroughbred horses at Hampton, where he had a racetrack installed. A 1799 advertisement promoted the stud services of his racehorse, Grey Medley. Another of Ridgely's racehorses, Post Boy, won the Washington City Jockey Club cup.\n\n","h_score":1678575.4812500002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":2277799,"revid":1173892190,"description":"Preserved slave estate in Baltimore County, Maryland","categories":["1948 establishments in Maryland","African-American history of Baltimore County, Maryland","Baltimore County, Maryland landmarks","Historic American Buildings Survey in Maryland","Historic house museums in Maryland","History of slavery in Maryland","Houses completed in 1790","Houses in Baltimore County, Maryland","Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Maryland","Museums in Baltimore County, Maryland","National Historic Sites in Maryland","National Register of Historic Places in Baltimore County, Maryland","Protected areas established in 1948","Ridgely family","Slave cabins and quarters in the United States"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Rediscovering Hampton's Timeless Elegance\n\nHampton National Historic Site whisks visitors back to 18th-century opulence with its sprawling Georgian mansion and verdant estates, blending history with nature's whisper.

Col. Lukash's grenadiers reinforced with two battalions of the Finnish Guards Regiment (1,300 men, four guns) outflanked Fort 73 from the north and captured a brickyard and yet another fortified inn, the Karczma \u017belazna directly to its rear. Its garrison offered only light resistance before retreating in disarray. The situation seemed critical, as the Russians were now in possession of a large part of the second line of Polish defences. Despite the apparent gravity of the situation, the Polish defenders still had sufficient fresh troops to counter-attack and regain the initiative. The Russians' recently captured positions were too far ahead of their artillery, and were all under well-aimed fire from Polish fixed artillery positions on the ramparts of the third line of defences, as well as numerous mobile artillery batteries. Forts 72 and 73, as well as the Karczma \u017belazna inn and the brickyard received constant grapeshot fire. Under fire from all sides, the Russians had to hide behind the outer sides of the ramparts, unable to return fire or even observe the field in front of them. Tirailleurs of the Polish 3rd Foot Rifle Regiment approached the Karczma \u017belazna inn almost unopposed and retook it. Soon afterwards they retook the brickyard as well. The Russians abandoned the two forts as well and although Russian light infantry tried to retake them, they were unsuccessful. Around 16:45 the field artillery batteries of J\u00f3zef Bem were free to leave the safety of the inner defences, return to the battlefield, and open fire on the Grand Battery. Despite over three hours of intensive fighting in the west, the commander of the relatively peaceful southern sector, General Ma\u0142achowski, did not reinforce the defenders of the western approaches.","h_score":1678047.5625,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":3402937,"revid":1170667005,"description":"Battle between Imperial Russia and Poland","categories":["1831 in Poland","19th century in Warsaw","Battles of the November Uprising","Conflicts in 1831","Military history of Warsaw","September 1831 events"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Battle of Warsaw: Poland's Fight for Independence in 1831\n\nIn 1831, Polish insurgents defended Warsaw against invading Russian forces during the November Uprising.

The season officially began on June 1, 1988, and lasted until November 30, 1988, although activity began on May 30 when a tropical depression developed in the Caribbean. The June through November dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The first cyclone to attain tropical storm status was Alberto on August 8, nearly a month later than usual. The final storm of the year, Tropical Storm Keith, became extratropical on November 24. The season produced 19 tropical depressions of which 12 attained tropical storm status. One tropical storm was operationally classified as a tropical depression but was reclassified in post-analysis. Five tropical cyclones reached hurricane status of which three became major hurricanes reaching Category 3 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.\n\nThere were two notable cyclones of the season, the first one being Hurricane Gilbert, which at the time was the strongest Atlantic hurricane on record. The hurricane tracked through the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico and caused devastation in Mexico and many island nations, particularly Jamaica. Its passage caused \\$2.98 billion in damage (1988 USD) and more than 300 deaths, mostly in Mexico. The second one was Hurricane Joan, which struck Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane and caused about US\\$1.87 billion in damage and more than 200 deaths. The hurricane crossed into the eastern Pacific Ocean and was reclassified as Tropical Storm Miriam. Hurricane Debby also successfully crossed over, becoming Tropical Depression Seventeen-E, making the 1988 season the first on record in which more than one tropical cyclone has crossed between the Atlantic and Pacific basins intact.\n\n ## Seasonal forecasts\n\nForecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University. A normal season as defined by NOAA has six to fourteen named storms of which four to eight reach hurricane strength and one to three become major hurricanes. The June 1988 forecast was that eleven storms would form and that seven would reach hurricane status. The forecast did not specify how many hurricanes would reach major hurricane status.\n\n","h_score":1669248.8812500001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":802559,"revid":1172949214,"description":"Hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean","categories":["1988 Atlantic hurricane season","Articles which contain graphical timelines","Tropical cyclones in 1988"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The 1988 Atlantic Hurricane Season: A Year of Powerful Storms\n\nThe season featured 19 tropical storms, including five hurricanes, with Hurricane Gilbert reaching Category 5 status.

However, with Australia touring South Africa in 1935\u201336, McCabe did not represent his state. However, he was made vice-captain to Vic Richardson for the tour, with Woodfull and Ponsford having retired, and Bradman ill. McCabe enjoyed more success, heading the Test batting figures with 420 runs at 84.00. After scoring 24, 65 and 29 in three warm-up matches, all of which were won by innings, McCabe hit 149 in the First Test at Durban, sharing a second-wicket partnership of 161 with Bill Brown in gale-force conditions which caused balls to make U-turns in the headwind, forced the umpires to glue the bails to the wickets using chewing gum, to set up a nine-wicket victory. In the following Test in Johannesburg, McCabe made 34 as Australia took a first innings lead of 93. However, Dudley Nourse scored 235 to help the hosts to 491; McCabe removed Nourse and ended with 2\/30. Australia were set a Test world record target of 399 in the second innings to achieve victory on a turning wicket, and McCabe told captain Richardson that he would not be able to bat or run between wickets effectively because of altitude sickness. Regarding McCabe was his most important batsman, Richardson implored him to bat and told him to simply stand his ground and hit boundaries so that he would not have to run. McCabe joined Fingleton at 1\/17 before taking the score to 1\/85 by the end of the third day. The following morning in poor visibility on a wicket with irregular bounce and lateral deviation, McCabe resumed on 38 and scored a century in the morning session to reach lunch at 138, after Fingleton was dismissed at 2\/194. The pair had put on 177 runs for the second wicket, and McCabe had done more than four fifths of the scoring. McCabe had reached his century in only 90 minutes, and continued on despite a storm that brought low dust clouds and hindered visibility, and increasingly irregular bounce and cut off the pitch. Midway through the afternoon, dark clouds gathered, along with thunderstorms and lightning, but this had no effect on the batsman. McCabe pushed the score to 2\/274, and with only 125 runs needed with half the day remaining, Australia were on course to meet the target, having already scored 189 in the first half. However, Herbie Wade, the South African captain made an unprecedented appeal against the light due fear \"for the fieldsmen's safety\" in the face of McCabe's aggressive batting. He finished unbeaten on 189, an innings described by Fingleton as \"bordering on miraculous\". McCabe struck 24 fours, and was productive square of the wicket, hitting numerous cut shots past point. Fingleton further added that \u201cMcCabe never put a foot or his bat in a false position\u201d, and that he \u201cpulverized the South African attack into the dust\u201d. McCabe was unable to maintain such a standard of performance in the remaining three Tests; he scored a duck, 40 and one, as Australia won each by an innings. He ended the series with three wickets at 45.33. However, he scored consecutive centuries in the tour matches, adding 115 and 112 against Border and Orange Free State.","h_score":1684897.1625000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":2270643,"revid":1167520169,"description":"Australian cricketer (1910\u20131968)","categories":["1910 births","1968 deaths","Accidental deaths from falls","Australia Test cricketers","Australian Army personnel of World War II","Australian Army soldiers","Australian Cricket Hall of Fame inductees","Australian Roman Catholics","Australian cricketers","Australian people of Irish descent","Cricketers from New South Wales","D.

It was launched in support of her third studio album, Britney (2001). The tour was promoted by Concerts West, marking the first time Spears did not tour with Clear Channel Entertainment. On September 21, 2001, a North American tour was announced that kicked off exactly two months later after various dates were postponed. In February 2002, Spears announced a second leg of the tour. It was directed and choreographed by Wade Robson, who explained the main theme of the show was Spears's coming of age and newfound independence. The stage was designed by Steve Cohen and Rob Brenner and was composed of a main stage and a B-stage, united by a runway. Inspired by Cleopatra's barge, a flying device was developed so Spears could travel over the audience to the B-stage. The setlist was mostly composed by songs from the supporting album, as Spears felt they were more reflective of her personality. Songs from her previous two studio albums were also included in remixed form by Robson.\n\nThe show was divided into seven segments with the last one being the encore. Spears opened the show hanging from a gyrating wheel; it continued with Spears performing a medley of older hits, jumping in bungee cords from the flying device onto the stage and dancing in a jungle setting. Most of the performances were accompanied by extravagant special effects, including confetti, pyrotechnics, laser lights, and artificial fog and snow. In the encore, there was a water screen that pumped two tons of water into the stage; this was considered one of the signature performances of the tour. During the 2002 leg, some changes were made; several songs were remixed, and Spears premiered various unreleased songs which included \"Mystic Man\". The show received acclaim from critics, who praised the show for being innovative and entertaining, while some dismissed it for taking the attention away from the music.\n\nAccording to Billboard, the 2001\u201302 dates in North America had an average of \\$803,683 in gross and 14,344 in attendance, bringing a total gross of \\$53,846,761 and 961,048 tickets sold in 66 shows, not including the Japanese sold-out show at Tokyo Dome in Tokyo for 60,000 fans. Overall, the Dream Within a Dream Tour grossed \\$56.8 million and sold more than 1 million of tickets in 68 shows. On July 27, 2002, Spears performed for 51,261 fans at Foro Sol stadium in Mexico City. The show grossed \\$2,251,379 and was the 37th on Pollstars Top 200 Concert Grosses in North America. During the second show in Mexico, Spears left the stage after the sixth song due to a lightning storm; the show was canceled and angered the audience. The tour was broadcast live on an HBO special on November 18, 2001, and went on to win an Emmy for Outstanding Technical Direction on the 2002 ceremony. A DVD titled Britney Spears Live from Las Vegas was released in January 2002.\n\n","h_score":1683929.4812500002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":2930367,"revid":1162015248,"description":"2001\u20132002 concert tour by Britney Spears","categories":["2001 concert tours","2002 concert tours","Britney Spears concert tours","Concert tours of Canada","Concert tours of Japan","Concert tours of Mexico","Concert tours of the United States"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the Dream Within a Dream Tour?  \nA1: It was a concert tour by Britney Spears in 2001-2002.  \n\nQ2: When and where did it occur?  \nA2: The tour ran from November 2001 to July 2002, mainly in North America and Europe.  \n\nQ3: Who were the main performers?  \nA3: Britney Spears headlined, with opening acts varying by show.  \n\nQ4: What were the key themes?  \nA4: It featured pop music and elaborate stage designs inspired by dreams.  \n\nQ5: How did audiences respond?  \nA5: Fans praised the energy, though some criticized production costs.  \n\nQ6: What made it unique?  \nA6: It included advanced visuals and interactive elements for its time.  \n\nQ7: Were there any challenges?  \nA7: The tour faced scheduling issues and high expenses.  \n\nQ8: What is its legacy?  \nA8: It influenced future pop tours with its spectacle."}

As Mack describes her, \"Chloe was a little spineless and a little bit too much of a pushover in season two\". Mack does believe that by the end of the season Chloe manages to get some of that integrity back. The actress likes to make sure that her character is kept \"smart\" and \"ambitious\", but at the end of season two Chloe's impulsiveness causes her to get stuck under Lionel's control, when she \"spitefully\" agrees to uncover Clark's secrets for Lionel Luthor after Clark is not honest with her about his newly established relationship with Lana.\n\nFor season three, Mack wanted the character to be given a major obstacle to overcome, something that would help the character mature. The obstacle in question became Lionel's control over Chloe, after she made a deal to spy on Clark. Allison Mack believes that Chloe is in her own comfort zone while she is working at the Torch, as she is in complete control, but likens Chloe being under Lionel's control to that of a \"caged animal\". When she ruins the lives of a mother and her son in season three's \"Truth\", after exposing the mother as a fugitive from the law, Chloe is forced to look deeper into her own self. Mack believes that this event was a turning point for Chloe's maturity; it is the moment that she realizes that there needs to be a line she should never cross. After it is revealed to Clark in the season five premiere that Chloe knows his secret, the character becomes a larger part of the storyline for the show. Knowing Clark's secret allowed Chloe to finally come to terms with her feelings for Clark, and recognize where their relationship will always be; Chloe's acceptance of her place in Clark's life provides a means for the two to have a more meaningful friendship, without the concerns of Chloe's unrequited love. According to Mack, Chloe has learned to evolve her love for Clark into something more \"genuine\" and \"selfless\".\n\nFor the actress, having Chloe become part of the meteor infected community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people\u2014the meteor infected\u2014she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand what it feels like to live in a world where you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her \u2013 her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to bring out the best in herself.\n\n","h_score":1681536.9750000001,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":571397,"revid":1165246647,"description":"Fictional character from Smallville","categories":["Comics characters introduced in 2010","DC Comics metahumans","Female characters in television","Fictional amateur detectives","Fictional characters from Kansas","Fictional characters with healing abilities","Fictional empaths","Fictional female businesspeople","Fictional hackers","Fictional information brokers","Fictional reporters","Fictional technopaths","Smallville characters","Suicide Squad members","Teenage characters in television","Television characters introduced in 2001","Television sidekicks"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Chloe Sullivan?  \nA1: Chloe Sullivan is a fictional character from the TV series Smallville, a sharp journalist and Clark Kent's loyal friend.  \n\nQ2: What is her role in Smallville?  \nA2: She serves as an investigative reporter, uncovering secrets with witty flair and tech-savvy skills.  \n\nQ3: How does she interact with Clark Kent?  \nA3: As his best friend, she supports his adventures, blending trust with occasional suspicion in their dynamic bond.  \n\nQ4: What are her key personality traits?  \nA4: Chloe is intelligent, resourceful, and fiercely determined, often diving into mysteries with bold curiosity.  \n\nQ5: How does her career evolve?  \nA5: Starting as a high school reporter, she rises to prominence at the Daily Planet, chasing truth with relentless drive.  \n\nQ6: What challenges does she face?  \nA6: She encounters dangers from kryptonite foes and personal risks, testing her resilience in shadowy plots.  \n\nQ7: How does she influence the story?  \nA7: Chloe's investigations often propel the plot, revealing clues that shape Clark's hero journey with clever twists.  \n\nQ8: Why is she memorable to fans?  \nA8: Her blend of brains, bravery, and heart makes her a standout ally, inspiring viewers with vivid, relatable spirit."}

Despite this, Sir Henry Parkes, the Premier of New South Wales and a free trader, had him appointed to the New South Wales Legislative Council on 8 February 1888. The protectionist George Dibbs appointed him Minister for Justice on 23 October 1891, a position in which he worked closely with his friend Barton, who was Attorney General. O'Connor also served as Solicitor General from 19 July to 13 September 1893. In these portfolios he worked for electoral reform and supported the cause of Federation. After becoming Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council in 1892 he exercised considerable control over that body, but his influence was greatly diminished after he and Barton were forced to resign from the ministry on 14 December 1893, having accepted briefs in a case in which they were required to argue against the railway commissioners, a government department. O'Connor remained in the Legislative Council but embarked on an overseas tour, travelling to Egypt, Italy, England and Ireland.\n\nIn 1895, O'Connor returned to New South Wales and successfully defended the protectionist demagogue Paddy Crick against conspiracy charges relating to the George Dean attempted murder case; he was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1896 and acted as a judge on the Supreme Court from November 1898 to March 1899. He also remained active politically. As a founding member of the Australian Federation League in 1893, he was appointed a vice-president of the People's Federal Convention held at Bathurst in November 1896. He was elected as a delegate to the Australian Federal Convention in 1897 and served on the constitutional committee with Barton and the former South Australian Premier Sir John Downer. He organised the \"nexus clause\" which guaranteed the Senate half as many members as the House of Representatives, arguing that this would act as an incentive to keep parliamentary numbers, and therefore expenditure, comparatively low.\n\nO'Connor resigned from the Legislative Council on 16 July 1898, in order to contest the lower house seat of Young against the sitting Labour member, Chris Watson. He focused his campaign on Federation issues but was surprised to be easily defeated by 1,244 votes to 876. Financial difficulties necessitated his focus on legal work rather than campaigning during the second Constitution referendum in 1899, although he still managed to speak most nights. Following the success of Federation, O'Connor was to be a member of the first Commonwealth ministry, and was instrumental in the affair that became known as the Hopetoun Blunder. Lord Hopetoun, Australia's first Governor-General, had commissioned Sir William Lyne to form a government, since Lyne was Premier of the largest state, New South Wales. O'Connor was one of those who refused to serve under Lyne, who had been lukewarm on the issue during the Federation campaigns, and was significant in the negotiations that led to Lyne's resignation of the commission in Barton's favour. On 1 January 1901, O'Connor was appointed Vice-President of the Executive Council, an honorary post, in Barton's Cabinet.\n\n","h_score":1660733.7375,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":1221056,"revid":1132684687,"description":"Australian politician and judge (1851\u20131912)","categories":["1851 births","1912 deaths","20th-century Australian politicians","Australian King's Counsel","Deaths from pernicious anemia","Justices of the High Court of Australia","Members of the Australian Senate","Members of the Australian Senate for New South Wales","Members of the Cabinet of Australia","Members of the New South Wales Legislative Council","People educated at Sydney Grammar School","Protectionist Party members of the Parliament of Australia"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Richard O'Connor: The Judicial Maverick of Australia\n\nIn the annals of Down Under's history, Richard Edward O'Connor emerges as the clever craftsman who welded Australia's legal backbone during its federation frenzy.

They had a beam of 60 ft (18 m) and a draught of 20 ft (6.1 m). The ships displaced 7,144 long tons (7,259 t) as designed and up to 7,670 long tons (7,793 t) at full load. The ships' hulls were constructed out of steel, and were built with a naval ram in the bow. Steering was controlled by a single rudder. Each vessel had a crew of 363 officers and enlisted men. Two heavy military masts were fitted, one just in front of the main battery guns and one behind. A hurricane deck covered the turrets and ran from the foremast to the funnels. Each ship carried a pair of second-class torpedo boats astern of the funnels, along with derricks to unload them.\n\nDingyuan and Zhenyuan were powered by a pair of horizontal, three-cylinder trunk steam engines, each of which drove a single screw propeller. Steam was provided by eight cylindrical boilers that were ducted into a pair of funnels amidships. The boilers were divided into four boiler rooms. The engines were rated at 6,000 indicated horsepower (4,500 kW) for a top speed of 14.5 knots (26.9 km\/h; 16.7 mph), though both ships exceeded these figures on trials, with Zhenyuan, the faster of the two, reaching 7,200 ihp (5,400 kW) and 15.4 kn (28.5 km\/h; 17.7 mph). The ships carried 700 long tons (711 t) of coal normally and up to 1,000 long tons (1,016 t); this enabled a cruising radius of 4,500 nautical miles (8,300 km; 5,200 mi) at a speed of 10 kn (19 km\/h; 12 mph). Both ships were fitted with sails for the voyage from Germany to China, though they were later removed.\n\n ### Armament and armour\n\nThe ships were armed with a main battery of four 12 in (305 mm) 20-caliber guns, mounted in two barbettes. The barbettes are sometimes reported to have been in different arrangements on Dingyuan and Zhenyuan, but both ships' guns were arranged identically, with the starboard barbette forward of the port one. The guns themselves were 31.5-long-ton (32 t) Krupp guns. The placement of the guns caused trim problems that led the ships to be wet forward.\n\nThe secondary battery consisted of two 5.9 in (150 mm) guns mounted individually, one on the bow and the other on the stern. For defence against torpedo boats, they carried a pair of 47 mm (1.9 in) Hotchkiss revolver cannons and eight 37 mm (1.5 in) Maxim-Nordenfelt quick-firing guns in casemates.\n\nThree 14 in (356 mm) torpedo tubes rounded out the armament; one was mounted in the stern, and the other two were placed forward of the main battery, all above water. They are sometimes reported to have been 15 in (381 mm) torpedo tubes.\n\nThe belt armour of the class was 14 in thick, while the barbettes for the main armament were 12 in. A 3 in (76 mm) armoured deck ran the entire length of the ships, leaving the ends undefended. The conning tower had further plating some 8 in (20 cm) thick, while the 5.9 in guns were each in turrets whose armour was somewhere between 0.5 to 3 in (13 to 76 mm) thick.\n\n ## Ships\n\n","h_score":1665587.1687500002,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":44450100,"revid":1136832312,"description":"Chinese class of ironclad warships","categories":["Battleships of the Imperial Japanese Navy","Dingyuan-class ironclads","Russo-Japanese War battleships of Japan","Ships built in Stettin"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Roaring Seas: Dingyuan-Class Ironclads Rule the Waves\n\nIn the 1880s, China's Dingyuan-class ironclads emerged as formidable armored warships, boasting thick plates and massive guns for the Beiyang Fleet.

Some Yugoslav territory was annexed by its Axis neighbours, Hungary, Bulgaria and Italy. The Germans engineered and supported the creation of the puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia (Croatian: Nezavisna Dr\u017eava Hrvatska, NDH), which roughly comprised most of the pre-war Banovina Croatia, along with rest of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and some adjacent territory. The Italians, Hungarians and Bulgarians occupied other parts of Yugoslavian territory. Germany did not annex any Yugoslav territory, but occupied northern parts of present-day Slovenia and stationed occupation troops in the northern half of the NDH. The German-occupied part of Slovenia was divided into two areas that were placed under the administration of the Gauleiters of the neighbouring Reichsgau K\u00e4rnten and Reichsgau Steiermark.\n\nThe remaining territory, which consisted of Serbia proper, the northern part of Kosovo (around Kosovska Mitrovica), and the Banat was occupied by the Germans and placed under the administration of a German military government. This was due to the key rail and riverine transport routes that passed through it, and its valuable resources, particularly non-ferrous metals.\n\nIn May, German troops of the 750th Infantry Regiment of the 704th Infantry Division were stationed in the Ma\u010dva, Jadra and Pocerina (Cer) districts of the Podrinje region, garrisoning \u0160abac, Banja Kovilja\u010da and Loznica.\n\nIn early July, shortly after the launching of Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union, armed resistance began in the German-occupied territory of Serbia, against both the German Army and the representatives of the German-installed puppet government known as the Commissioner Government. This was a response to appeals from both Joseph Stalin and the Communist International for communist organisations across occupied Europe to draw German troops away from the Eastern Front, and followed a meeting of the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party in Belgrade on 4 July. This meeting resolved to shift to a general uprising, form Partisan detachments of fighters and commence armed resistance, and call for the populace to rise up against the occupiers throughout Yugoslavia. This also coincided with the departure of the last of the German invasion force that had remained to oversee the transition to occupation. From the appearance of posters and pamphlets urging the population to undertake sabotage, it rapidly turned to attempted and actual sabotage of German propaganda facilities and railway and telephone lines. The first fighting occurred at the village of Bela Crkva on 7 July, when gendarmes tried to disperse a public meeting, and two gendarmes were killed.\n\n","h_score":1667963.71875,"h_score_cat":6,"pageid":17625858,"revid":1172802026,"description":"Battle between Serbian Chetniks and Germans in Serbia","categories":["1941 in Yugoslavia","August 1941 events","Battles of World War II involving Chetniks","Battles of World War II involving Germany","Conflicts in 1941","Loznica","Yugoslavia in World War II"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What was the Battle of Loznica in 1941?  \nA1: It was a World War II conflict in Serbia between Yugoslav partisans and Axis forces.  \n\nQ2: When did the battle occur?  \nA2: In September 1941.  \n\nQ3: Where was the battle fought?  \nA3: In and around Loznica, a town in western Serbia.  \n\nQ4: Who were the main participants?  \nA4: Yugoslav partisans resisted German troops and local collaborators.  \n\nQ5: What was the context of the battle?  \nA5: It arose from resistance to Axis occupation after Yugoslavia's invasion.  \n\nQ6: What was the outcome?  \nA6: Partisans achieved a tactical win but faced heavy casualties.  \n\nQ7: Why is the battle significant?  \nA7: It highlighted early guerrilla resistance in the Balkans.  \n\nQ8: How does it fit into World War II?  \nA8: It contributed to broader anti-Axis uprisings in occupied Europe."}

His inaugural lecture at Imperial College concerned the large sieve: bounding the size of sets of integers from which many congruence classes of numbers modulo prime numbers have been forbidden. Roth had previously published a paper on this problem in 1965.\n\nAnother of Roth's interests was the Heilbronn triangle problem, of placing points in a square to avoid triangles of small area. His 1951 paper on the problem was the first to prove a nontrivial upper bound on the area that can be achieved. He eventually published four papers on this problem, the latest in 1976. Roth also made significant progress on square packing in a square. If unit squares are packed into an $s\\times s$ square in the obvious, axis-parallel way, then for values of $s$ that are just below an integer, nearly $2s$ area can be left uncovered. After Paul Erd\u0151s and Ronald Graham proved that a more clever tilted packing could leave a significantly smaller area, only $O(s^{7\/11})$, Roth and Bob Vaughan responded with a 1978 paper proving the first nontrivial lower bound on the problem. As they showed, for some values of $s$, the uncovered area must be at least proportional to $\\sqrt{s}$.\n\nIn 1966, Heini Halberstam and Roth published their book Sequences, on integer sequences. Initially planned to be the first of a two-volume set, its topics included the densities of sums of sequences, bounds on the number of representations of integers as sums of members of sequences, density of sequences whose sums represent all integers, sieve theory and the probabilistic method, and sequences in which no element is a multiple of another. A second edition was published in 1983.\n\n ## Recognition\n\nRoth won the Fields Medal in 1958 for his work on Diophantine approximation. He was the first British Fields medalist. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1960, and later became an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Fellow of University College London, Fellow of Imperial College London, and Honorary Fellow of Peterhouse. It was a source of amusement to him that his Fields Medal, election to the Royal Society, and professorial chair came to him in the reverse order of their prestige.\n\nThe London Mathematical Society gave Roth the De Morgan Medal in 1983. In 1991, the Royal Society gave him their Sylvester Medal \"for his many contributions to number theory and in particular his solution of the famous problem concerning approximating algebraic numbers by rationals.\"\n\nA festschrift of 32 essays on topics related to Roth's research was published in 2009, in honour of Roth's 80th birthday, and in 2017 the editors of the journal Mathematika dedicated a special issue to Roth. After Roth's death, the Imperial College Department of Mathematics instituted the Roth Scholarship in his honour.\n\n ## Selected publications\n\n ### Journal papers\n\n\n ### Book\n\n- A second edition was published in 1983 by Springer-Verlag.","h_score":1736856.8562500002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":787827,"revid":1170425438,"description":"British mathematician","categories":["1925 births","2015 deaths","20th-century English mathematicians","Academics of Imperial College London","Academics of University College London","Alumni of Peterhouse, Cambridge","Alumni of University College London","De Morgan Medallists","Fellows of the Royal Society","Fields Medalists","Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to the United Kingdom","Number theorists","People educated at St Paul's School, London","People from the Province of Lower Silesia"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Klaus Roth?  \nA1: Klaus Roth was a brilliant British mathematician, born in 1925, who dazzled the world with his genius in number theory.  \n\nQ2: What sparked his interest in math?  \nA2: Roth's passion ignited early, fueled by wartime puzzles and academic curiosity, leading to his stellar career.  \n\nQ3: What's Roth's theorem about?  \nA3: It tackles Diophantine approximation, proving irrational numbers' quirks with elegant precision, like a mathematical magic trick.  \n\nQ4: Did he win any awards?  \nA4: Yes, he snagged the Fields Medal in 1958, math's Nobel equivalent, for his groundbreaking work.  \n\nQ5: How did his work impact science?  \nA5: Roth's ideas rippled through number theory, inspiring deeper explorations and unexpected connections in modern math.  \n\nQ6: What was his educational background?  \nA6: He studied at Cambridge University, where rigorous training honed his analytical prowess into a sharp tool.  \n\nQ7: Was Roth involved in teaching?  \nA7: Absolutely, he mentored at universities, sharing his vivid insights to spark the next generation's fire.  \n\nQ8: What's his lasting legacy?  \nA8: Roth's theorems echo eternally, a playful dance of numbers that still challenges and delights mathematicians today."}

That, and the evidence presented against him by his sister Jennet, who said that she had seen her brother asking a black dog he had conjured up to help him kill Townley, was sufficient to persuade the jury to find him guilty. 19 August The trials of the three Samlesbury witches were heard before Anne Redferne's first appearance in court, late in the afternoon, charged with the murder of Robert Nutter. The evidence against her was considered unsatisfactory, and she was acquitted. Anne Redferne was not so fortunate the following day, when she faced her second trial, for the murder of Robert Nutter's father, Christopher, to which she pleaded not guilty. Demdike's statement to Nowell, which accused Anne of having made clay figures of the Nutter family, was read out in court. Witnesses were called to testify that Anne was a witch \"more dangerous than her Mother\". But she refused to admit her guilt to the end, and had given no evidence against any others of the accused. Anne Redferne was found guilty. Jane Bulcock and her son John Bulcock, both from Newchurch in Pendle, were accused and found guilty of the murder by witchcraft of Jennet Deane. Both denied that they had attended the meeting at Malkin Tower, but Jennet Device identified Jane as having been one of those present, and John as having turned the spit to roast the stolen sheep, the centrepiece of the Good Friday meeting at the Demdike's home. Alice Nutter was unusual among the accused in being comparatively wealthy, the widow of a tenant yeoman farmer. She made no statement either before or during her trial, except to enter her plea of not guilty to the charge of murdering Henry Mitton by witchcraft. The prosecution alleged that she, together with Demdike and Elizabeth Device, had caused Mitton's death after he had refused to give Demdike a penny she had begged from him. The only evidence against Alice seems to have been that James Device claimed Demdike had told him of the murder, and Jennet Device in her statement said that Alice had been present at the Malkin Tower meeting. Alice may have called in on the meeting at Malkin Tower on her way to a secret (and illegal) Good Friday Catholic service, and refused to speak for fear of incriminating her fellow Catholics. Many of the Nutter family were Catholics, and two had been executed as Jesuit priests, John Nutter in 1584 and his brother Robert in 1600. Alice Nutter was found guilty. Katherine Hewitt (a.k.a. Mould-Heeles) was charged and found guilty of the murder of Anne Foulds. She was the wife of a clothier from Colne, and had attended the meeting at Malkin Tower with Alice Grey. According to the evidence given by James Device, both Hewitt and Grey told the others at that meeting that they had killed a child from Colne, Anne Foulds. Jennet Device also picked Katherine out of a line-up, and confirmed her attendance at the Malkin Tower meeting. Alice Grey was accused with Katherine Hewitt of the murder of Anne Foulds. Potts does not provide an account of Alice Grey's trial, simply recording her as one of the Samlesbury witches \u2013 which she was not, as she was one of those identified as having been at the Malkin Tower meeting \u2013 and naming her in the list of those found not guilty. Alizon Device, whose encounter with John Law had triggered the events leading up to the trials, was charged with causing harm by witchcraft. Uniquely among the accused, Alizon was confronted in court by her alleged victim, John Law. She seems to have genuinely believed in her own guilt; when Law was brought into court Alizon fell to her knees in tears and confessed. She was found guilty. ## The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster\n\nAlmost everything that is known about the trials comes from a report of the proceedings written by Thomas Potts, the clerk to the Lancaster Assizes. Potts was instructed to write his account by the trial judges, and had completed the work by 16 November 1612, when he submitted it for review. Bromley revised and corrected the manuscript before its publication in 1613, declaring it to be \"truly reported\" and \"fit and worthie to be published\".\n\nAlthough written as an apparently verbatim account, The Wonderfull Discoverie is not a report of what was actually said at the trial but is instead reflecting what happened. Nevertheless, Potts \"seems to give a generally trustworthy, although not comprehensive, account of an Assize witchcraft trial, provided that the reader is constantly aware of his use of written material instead of verbatim reports\".\n\nThe trials took place not quite seven years after the Gunpowder Plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament in an attempt to kill King James and the Protestant aristocracy had been foiled. It was alleged that the Pendle witches had hatched their own gunpowder plot to blow up Lancaster Castle, although historian Stephen Pumfrey has suggested that the \"preposterous scheme\" was invented by the examining magistrates and simply agreed to by James Device in his witness statement. It may therefore be significant that Potts dedicated The Wonderfull Discoverie to Thomas Knyvet and his wife Elizabeth; Knyvet was the man credited with apprehending Guy Fawkes and thus saving the King.\n\n","h_score":1717826.40625,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":19269991,"revid":1166933158,"description":"English witch hunt and trial in 1612","categories":["1612 in England","1612 in law","17th-century executions by England","17th-century trials","Borough of Pendle","English people executed for witchcraft","Executed English women","History of Lancashire","Lancashire folklore","People executed by Stuart England","Witch trials in England"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What were the Pendle witches?  \nA1: The Pendle witches refer to people accused of witchcraft in 1612 in Lancashire, England.

The game has an aggregated review score of 90 out of 100 at Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu magazine scored the PlayStation 2 version of the game a 30 out of 40. The game is considered by some to be one of the greatest games of all time; Edge ranked Ico as the 13th top game in a 2007 listing, while IGN ranked the game at number 18 in 2005, and at number 57 in 2007. Ico has been used as an example of a game that is a work of art. Ueda commented that he purposely tried to distance Ico from conventional video games due to the negative image video games were receiving at that time, in order to draw more people to the title. Some reviewers have likened Ico to older, simpler adventure games such as Prince of Persia or Tomb Raider, that seek to evoke an emotional experience from the player; IGN's David Smith commented that while simple, as an experience the game was \"near indescribable.\" The game's graphics and sound contributed strongly to the positive reactions from critics; Smith continues that \"The visuals, sound, and original puzzle design come together to make something that is almost, if not quite, completely unlike anything else on the market, and feels wonderful because of it.\" Many reviewers were impressed with the expansiveness and the details given to the environments, the animation used for the main characters despite their low polygon count, as well as the use of lighting effects. Ico's ambiance, created by the simple music and the small attention to detail in the voice work of the main characters, were also called out as strong points for the game. Charles Herold of The New York Times summed up his review stating that \"Ico is not a perfect game, but it is a game of perfect moments.\" Herold later commented that Ico breaks the mold of games that usually involve companions. In most games these companions are invulnerable and players will generally not concern with the non-playable characters' fate, but Ico creates the sense of \"trust and childish fragility\" around Yorda, which leads to the character being \"the game's entire focus\". The game is noted for its simple combat system that would \"disappoint those craving sheer mechanical depth\", as stated by GameSpot's Miguel Lopez. The game's puzzle design has been praised for creating a rewarding experience for players who work through challenges on their own; Kristen Reed of Eurogamer, for example, said that \"you quietly, logically, willingly proceed, and the illusion is perfect: the game never tells you what to do, even though the game is always telling you what to do\". Ico is also considered a short game, taking between seven and ten hours for a single play through, which Game Revolution calls \"painfully short\" with \"no replay outside of self-imposed challenges\". G4TV's Matthew Keil, however, felt that \"the game is so strong, many will finish 'Ico' in one or two sittings\". The lack of features in the North American release, which would become unlocked on subsequent playthroughs after completing the game, was said to reduce the replay value of the title. Electronic Gaming Monthly notes that \"Yorda would probably be the worst companion -she's scatterbrained and helpless; if not for the fact that the player develops a bond with her, making the game's ending all the more heartrending.\" Francesca Reyes reviewed the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"Intensely involving and wonderfully simple, Ico, though flawed, deserves to find its niche as a quiet classic.\" Despite the positive praise, the original title did not sell well. By 2009, only 700,000 copies were sold worldwide, with 270,000 in the United States, and the bulk in PAL regions. Ueda considered his design by subtraction approach may have hurt the marketing of the game, as at the time of the game's release, promotion of video games were primarily done through screenshots, and as Ico lacked any heads-up display, it appeared uninteresting to potential buyers. ### Awards\n\nIco received several acclamations from the video game press, and was considered to be one of the Games of the Year by many publications, despite competing with releases such as Halo: Combat Evolved, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, and Grand Theft Auto III. The game received three Game Developers Choice Awards in 2002, including \"Excellence in Level Design\", \"Excellence in Visual Arts\", and \"Game Innovation Spotlight\". The game won two Interactive Achievement Awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences in 2002 for outstanding achievements in \"Art Direction\" and \"Character or Story Development\"; it also received nominations for \"Game of the Year\", \"Console Game of the Year\", \"Console Action\/Adventure Game of the Year\", \"Innovation in Console Gaming\", and outstanding achievements in \"Game Design\", and \"Sound Design\". It won GameSpot's annual \"Best Graphics, Artistic\" prize among console games. It was one of three titles to win the Special Award at the sixth CESA Game Awards.\n\n","h_score":1730158.5375000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":161487,"revid":1169680794,"description":"2001 Japanese action-adventure video game","categories":["2001 video games","Action-adventure games","Art games","Cancelled PlayStation (console) games","Cooperative video games","D.I.C.E.

It was the first time that a Scottish team reached the final of the tournament, with Queen's Park knocking out the previous holders of the trophy en route.\n\nBoth teams received protests from the defeated teams following the semi-final matches, but each were turned down by the Football Association. By the time the match was played, Queen's Park had already been awarded the Scottish Cup after Vale of Leven declined to participate in the final. Prior to the match there were temporary stands built at the Oval as the Pavilion was reserved for members of the Surrey County Cricket Club.

In April, at the Ohio Grand Prix, he broke the record again, with a time of 48.34 seconds, also defeating Michael Phelps.\n\nA month before the Olympics, in July 2008, he broke his South American record in the 50-metre freestyle, with a time of 21.75 seconds.\n\nAfterward, Cielo went to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where he broke the Americas record in the 4\u00d7100-metre freestyle heats, with a time of 47.91 seconds. Although the Brazilian team was disqualified, Cielo's record was allowed to stand. In the 100-metre freestyle, Cielo qualified for the final, taking eighth place in the heats, with a time of 48.07 seconds. Cielo excelled in the early part of the first semifinal, making his turn in second place, at 22.62 seconds, but finishing fifth. In the final, Cielo adopted a different tactic, turning third, slower (22.74 seconds) than in the semifinals, and saving energy for the finish, which resulted in his winning the bronze medal and breaking the South American record with a time of 47.67 seconds (tied with American swimmer Jason Lezak). Alain Bernard won the gold medal and Eamon Sullivan won the silver. Shortly after winning the bronze medal, Cielo gave a statement to the Brazilian press, stating categorically: \"Now I'm going to win the 50m\". In the 50-metre freestyle event, Cielo set the Olympic record, that Alexander Popov had set in the 1992 Summer Olympics, during the heats (21.47 seconds, equaling Garrett Weber-Gale's Americas record) and in the semifinals (21.34 seconds). He lowered this further in the finals, again breaking the Olympic record with a time of 21.30 seconds, winning the gold medal and missing the world record by 0.02 seconds. With this, he became the first Brazilian Olympic swimming champion. Until Cielo's Olympic gold, the best Brazilian Olympic swimming result had been obtained by Ricardo Prado, who won the silver medal in the 400-metre individual medley at the 1984 Summer Olympics, and previously Gustavo Borges, who won the silver medal in the 100-metre freestyle at the 1992 Summer Olympics and in the 200-metre freestyle at the 1996 Summer Olympics.\n\nAfter the Olympics, in October, in the first stage of the 2008 FINA Swimming World Cup, held in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, Cielo equaled the short-course South American record in the 50-metre freestyle, with a time of 21.32 seconds.\n\n","h_score":1697486.9187500002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":12627202,"revid":1171578538,"description":"Brazilian swimmer","categories":["1987 births","Auburn Tigers men's swimmers","Brazilian male backstroke swimmers","Brazilian male butterfly swimmers","Brazilian male freestyle swimmers","Brazilian people of Italian descent","Brazilian sportspeople in doping cases","Doping cases in swimming","Living people","Medalists at the 2007 Pan American Games","Medalists at the 2008 Summer Olympics","Medalists at the 2011 Pan American Games","Medalists at the 2012 Summer Olympics","Medalists at the FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m)","Olympic bronze medalists for Brazil","Olympic bronze medalists in swimming","Olympic gold medalists for Brazil","Olympic gold medalists in swimming","Olympic swimmers for Brazil","Pan American Games gold medalists for Brazil","Pan American Games medalists in swimming","Pan American Games silver medalists for Brazil","People from Santa B\u00e1rbara d'Oeste","Swimmers at the 2007 Pan American Games","Swimmers at the 2008 Summer Olympics","Swimmers at the 2011 Pan American Games","Swimmers at the 2012 Summer Olympics","Swimmers from S\u00e3o Paulo (state)","World Aquatics Championships medalists in swimming","World record holders in swimming"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### C\u00e9sar Cielo: Brazil's Aquatic Phenom\n\nC\u00e9sar Cielo, the Brazilian swimming star, captured Olympic gold in 2008 and shattered world records in freestyle events.

Such cracks are caused by high loads where the wheels contact the rail. Repeated high loading causes fatigue cracks to grow. When they reach a critical size, the rail fails. Portions of the failed track at Hatfield were reassembled and numerous fatigue cracks were identified. They contributed to the spalling of the running surface to around five millimetres (0.2 in) deep and 100 millimetres (3.9 in) long.\n\nThe problem was known about before the accident; a letter from the infrastructure company Railtrack in December 1999 warned that the existing Railtrack Line Specification was insufficient to guard against this type of fatigue. Replacement rails were made available but never delivered to the correct location for installation.\n\nSince privatisation, Railtrack had divested the engineering knowledge of British Rail to contractors. While it had comprehensive maintenance procedures that might have prevented the accident if followed appropriately, later investigation showed there was a serious problem with the experience and working knowledge of staff. In a subsequent interview, the Zone Quality Standards Manager said, \"I do not have knowledge of railway engineering nor railway safety\", which was completely contrary to the written requirements for the role. In May 1999, the Head of Track had said that insufficiently-skilled work was causing more rails to break. Railtrack did not know how many other cases of rail fatigue around the network could lead to a similar accident. It consequently imposed over 1,800 emergency speed restrictions and instigated a costly nationwide track replacement programme. The company was subject to \"enforcement\" by the Rail Regulator, Tom Winsor.\n\n","h_score":1740200.20625,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":917407,"revid":1116575703,"description":"2000 rail accident in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, England","categories":["2000 disasters in the United Kingdom","2000s in Hertfordshire","Hatfield, Hertfordshire","History of Hertfordshire","October 2000 events in the United Kingdom","Railway accidents and incidents in Hertfordshire","Railway accidents in 2000"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Disaster on the Rails: The Hatfield Crash\n\nOn October 17, 2000, a high-speed train derailed near Hatfield, UK, killing four people and injuring over 70 due to track failure.

Before the race began, Valtteri Bottas was sidelined due to a back injury sustained in qualifying. Both Daniil Kvyat's Red Bull and Kevin Magnussen's McLaren failed to make it to the grid as their cars broke down on the out-lap; Kvyat suffering transmission problems and Magnussen with an engine failure. This left the grid with 15 starters \u2013 the lowest number for a season-opening race since 1963 and the lowest overall since the infamous 2005 United States Grand Prix.\n\nAt the start, Hamilton assumed the lead while a three-car wide tussle at turn one, involving Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, Felipe Nasr and Pastor Maldonado, resulted in Maldonado crashing out at turn two and race officials deploying the safety car. The next lap, Romain Grosjean's car failed thus taking both Lotus cars out of the race. Normal racing resumed on lap four, with Carlos Sainz Jr. falling back from fifth to his starting position in seventh place after being passed by Nasr and Daniel Ricciardo. Nasr also lost track position after being ordered by his team to relinquish a position for overtaking while still under safety car conditions.\n\nHamilton maintained in the lead until lap 25, when he made a pit stop for tyres. He resumed the lead from Rosberg after he too had to pit for new tyres. During this series of pitstops, Sebastian Vettel gained a position by passing Felipe Massa for third place. On lap 34, Max Verstappen retired while in a points-scoring position after his Toro Rosso was engulfed by smoke. On lap 42, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen also retired at turn four after a botched pitstop caused his left rear tyre to come loose. This put Jenson Button briefly into the tenth and final points position but for Sergio P\u00e9rez quickly passing the McLaren-Honda driver after a race long battle that begun at the start, for last position.\n\nFrom there, the order remained relatively constant with Hamilton going on to take his 34th Grand Prix win. He was followed by Rosberg, Vettel, Massa and Nasr. Completing the point-scorers were Ricciardo, Nico H\u00fclkenberg, Ericsson, Sainz and P\u00e9rez. In all, only eleven cars finished the race with Button's McLaren being the only car to finish outside the points and everyone from sixth position down lapped.\n\nEricsson, Nasr and Sainz all scored their first Formula One points, with Nasr and Sainz doing so on debut.

Initially, Mary Lambert was appointed director, but was soon replaced by Pierson. Warner Bros. gave Pierson a \\$14,000 budget for the shooting, which took place in Los Angeles in February 1984. Christopher Ciccone, the singer's brother, and Erika Belle appeared in the video as dancers; Ciccone recalled that, \"[Madonna] asked us to dance in her 'Lucky Star' video [...] We shoot at the old Charlie Chaplin studio [...] I get paid just \\$200 and don't get any royalties either. However, at the time, I am happy just to be a part of it. The camaraderie between Madonna, Erika, Martin [Burgoyne], and me is enough for me\".\n\nIn the video, Madonna wore a black outfit consisting of a mesh crop top, fingerless lace gloves, skirt over leggings, and stars and crucifixes dangling from her ears and around her waist. Although Belle was credited with coming up with the ensemble, biographer Mary Cross noted that Madonna was wearing her \"day-to-day\" clothing. At the time of the song's release, the singer's fashion was catching on as a statement among club kids and her fans, with the crucifixes she wore as earrings being the most prominent; Madonna herself commented that, \"[wearing a crucifix] was kind of offbeat and interesting. I mean, everything I do is sort of tongue-in-cheek. Besides, [the crucifixes] seem to go with my name.\" Cross however, wrote that the singer was trying to find a distinctive image for herself, and stand out among artists like Boy George, Cyndi Lauper, and David Bowie. \"Lucky Star\" was added to MTV the week of June 2, 1984; afterwards, it was added to Madonna's video compilations The Immaculate Collection (1990) and Celebration: The Video Collection (2009).\n\nThe visual starts with a black and white close-up of Madonna's face, as she slides her sunglasses down her nose. The image then fades to white and resumes in color. Scenes of Madonna, Ciccone and Belle dancing against a plain white background are interspersed with closeups of the singer's \"mesmerized\" gaze. The video ends with the initial black-and-white image repeated, but in retrograde, as Madonna puts back on the sunglasses.\n\n","h_score":1747885.59375,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":2288351,"revid":1173651024,"description":"1983 single by Madonna","categories":["1983 singles","1983 songs","Madonna songs","Post-disco songs","Sire Records singles","Song recordings produced by Reggie Lucas","Songs written by Madonna","Warner Records singles"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is \"Lucky Star\"?\nA1: \"Lucky Star\" is a vibrant pop song by Madonna.

After much confusion, SS Division Hitlerjugend got moving at about 14:30; several units advanced towards one of the beaches on which the Allies had landed, until they were halted by naval and anti-tank fire and Allied air interdiction. Meyer, confident that the Allied forces were \"little fishes\", ordered his regiment to counterattack. The attack led to heavy casualties. The division was ordered to break through to the beach on 7 June, but Meyer instructed his regiment to take covering positions and await reinforcements. The Canadian Official History described Meyer's involvement in the battle: > Although Meyer claimed later that only shortage of petrol and ammunition prevented him from carrying the attack on towards the coast, this need not be taken seriously. Indeed, he himself testified that seeing from his lofty perch \"enemy movements deeper in that area\"\u2014doubtless the advance of the main body of the 9th Brigade\u2014he came down and rode his motorcycle to the 3rd Battalion to order its C.O. \"not to continue the attack north of Buron\". Meyer's 2nd Battalion had been drawn into the fight, north of St. Contest \"in the direction of Galmanche\". Fierce fighting was going on when Meyer visited the battalion in the early evening; just as he arrived the battalion commander's head was taken off by a tank shot ... Meyer ordered both this battalion and the 1st (around Cambes) to go \"over from attack to defense.\" By 22:00, Meyer had set up his command post in Ardenne Abbey. That evening, elements of the division under Meyer's command committed the Ardenne Abbey massacre; eleven Canadian prisoners of war, soldiers from the North Nova Scotia Highlanders and the 27th Armoured Regiment were shot in the back of the head. On 14 June, divisional commander SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer Fritz Witt was killed when a naval barrage hit his command post. Meyer, the next-highest-ranking officer, was promoted to divisional commander; at 33 years of age, he was one of the war's youngest German divisional commanders. According to historian Peter Lieb, Meyer's rise to division command was relatively typical for the Waffen-SS, as the latter desired individuals as commanders who were regarded as ruthless, brutal, and ready to serve at the front line. By 4 July, the division had been reduced to a weak battlegroup; six days later, it retreated behind the Orne River. In just over a month of fighting, the division had more than a 60 per cent casualty rate. The Canadian forces began their advance on Falaise, planning to meet up with the Americans with the goal of encircling and destroying most of the German forces in Normandy. The Hitlerjugend division was holding the northern point of what became known as the Falaise pocket. After several days of fighting Meyer's unit was reduced to about 1,500 men, whom he led in an attempt to break out of the pocket. Meyer described the conditions in the pocket in his memoirs: \"Concentrated in such a confined space, we offer unique targets for the enemy air power. [...] Death shadows us at every step\". Meyer was wounded during the fight with the 3rd Canadian Division, but escaped from the Falaise pocket with the division's rearguard. The remnants of the division joined the retreat across the Seine and into Belgium. On 27 August, Meyer was awarded the Swords to the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and promoted to SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer. He led his retreating unit as far as the Meuse, where he and his headquarters were ambushed by an American armoured column on 6 September. The division's staff fled into a nearby village, where Meyer and his driver hid in a barn. A farmer discovered them, and informed the Belgian resistance. Meyer surrendered to local partisans, who handed him over to the Americans on 7 September.","h_score":1727316.6375000002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":1673302,"revid":1167748022,"description":"German SS officer (1910\u20131961)","categories":["1910 births","1961 deaths","German mass murderers","German prisoners of war in World War II held by the United Kingdom","German prisoners of war in World War II held by the United States","German prisoners sentenced to death","Hitler Youth members","Members of HIAG","Military personnel from Lower Saxony","Nazi Party members","Nazis convicted of war crimes","People from Helmstedt (district)","Perpetrators of World War II prisoner of war massacres","Prisoners sentenced to death by Canada","Recipients of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords","SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer","Waffen-SS personnel"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Kurt Meyer?  \nA1: Kurt Meyer, nicknamed \"Panzer,\" was a fierce Waffen-SS commander in WWII, leading tank divisions with iron will.\n\nQ2: What was his military background?  \nA2: He rose through the ranks in the SS, mastering armored warfare, turning battlefields into chaotic storms of steel.\n\nQ3: What key battles did he fight?  \nA3: Meyer spearheaded assaults in France and Russia, his panzers slicing enemy lines like predatory beasts.\n\nQ4: Why is he controversial?  \nA4: Accused of war crimes, including civilian massacres, his legacy mixes heroic myth with dark shadows of atrocity.\n\nQ5: What happened at his trial?  \nA5: Convicted for murder in 1946, he served time but was later released, sparking debates on justice's jagged edge.\n\nQ6: How did he impact history?  \nA6: As a symbol of SS fanaticism, Meyer embodied war's brutal duality, influencing modern views on military ethics.\n\nQ7: Any personal quirks?  \nA7: Known for his charismatic leadership and love of fast vehicles, he lived as a thrill-seeking wolf in uniform.\n\nQ8: What lessons emerge from his life?  \nA8: Meyer's story warns of blind loyalty's perils, urging us to question authority amid history's echoing thunder."}

It was built in 1838 in recognition of Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1830 to 1834. In particular, it celebrates the passing of the Great Reform Act of 1832, one of Grey's most important legislative achievements. The act reorganised the system of parliamentary constituencies and increased the number of those eligible to vote.\n\nThe monument is located at the junction of Grey, Grainger and Blackett Streets and has a total height of 133 ft (41 m). It was funded via public subscription and consists of a statue of Earl Grey on a pedestal standing on top of a Roman Doric column. The column was designed by local architect, Benjamin Green, and the statue was created by the sculptor, Edward Hodges Baily.\n\nA contemporary report of the unveiling ceremony described the monument as \"a fine imaginative work of art\" and other 19th century commentators praised it as \"a noble effort of genius\" and as having \"a most commanding appearance\". However, its location, then at the centre of the city's tram infrastructure, was criticised as unsuitable, with one newspaper declaring that \"in its present situation, it will be a great nuisance\" and, in the 1920s, there were calls to move the column to improve traffic flow. In 1981, the nearby station on the Tyne and Wear Metro was named after the monument. The pedestrianised area around the base is a popular meeting place and is used as a speakers' corner.\n\n ## History\n\n ### Context\n\nGrey's Monument was erected in recognition of the tenure of Charles Grey as Prime Minister.

In 1830 he was invited to form a government and became Prime Minister. It was during his time as Prime Minister that he passed the Great Reform Act, which brought about constituency reform and extended the right to vote.

Shigefumi Hino took the role of graphics designer. Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development handled development with a team of ten people, including three main programmers and a character designer, most of whom had worked on past Super Mario titles. In a retrospective interview, the core team said Miyamoto wielded the most authority during development. Super Mario World was the first Mario series game developed for the then-upcoming Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). As such, the team anticipated some difficulty in working with new and more advanced hardware. According to Tezuka, the software tools were not yet fully developed, and the team had to \"go along with starting something new\". Miyamoto acknowledged the team no longer had restrictions on certain mechanics such as scrolling and the number of colours they could implement. As a hardware experiment, the team ported Super Mario Bros.3 to the SNES. However, it felt like the same game to them, despite the improved colours and sprites. After that, Miyamoto realised the team's goal would be to use the new hardware to create something \"totally new\". Miyamoto said he had wanted Mario to have a dinosaur companion ever since Super Mario Bros., but Nintendo engineers could not add such a character into the game due to the limitations of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The inspiration for Yoshi can be traced back even further; Miyamoto designed a green dragon for the 1984 game Devil World which shared many similarities with Yoshi. During the development of Super Mario Bros.3, Miyamoto had a number of sketches around his desk, including an image of Mario riding a horse. As development of Super Mario World progressed, the team opted to set the game in a \"dinosaur land\", so Tezuka asked designer Shigefumi Hino to draw a reptile-like creature based on Miyamoto's sketches. Hino originally produced a design that Tezuka deemed too reptilian, and \"didn't really fit into the Mario world\", so he encouraged the designer to create a \"cuter\" character. Tezuka speculated that Miyamoto's love of horse riding, as well as country and western themes, influenced Yoshi's creation. Reflecting on how he had created different melodies for Super Mario Bros.3, composer Koji Kondo decided to reuse the same themes for Super Mario World, albeit in a rearranged form. By doing this, he assumed players would be able to recognise the same melodies, while exposing them to new variations of music as they progressed through the game. As Super Mario World was the first game developed for the SNES, Kondo felt \"overjoyed\" at being able to compose music by using eight sounds at once. To express the technological novelty of the new console, he used several different instruments, implementing them all one after the other in the game's title song. As development progressed, Kondo grew concerned over how people would react to his unusual combinations of instruments as he noted the use of more traditional square waves and triangle waves had \"gained acceptance\" with consumers. For the game's sound effects, Kondo decided to use a variety of musical instruments, as opposed to square waves, to emphasise that the game used traditional technology with a hybrid of new materials. It took Kondo around a year and a half to write all the music for the game. Super Mario World was produced during the console wars \u2013 a result of the rivalry between Nintendo's SNES and Sega's two-year-old Mega Drive system \u2013 which outsold the console and led to intense competition between the two, being the first time since December 1985 Nintendo did not lead the market though it eventually overtook Sega. Sega's mascot, Sonic the Hedgehog, was seen by many as a faster and \"cooler\" alternative to Mario.

In 1924, Lycorhinus was named, and classified as a cynodont, by Sidney Haughton. Heterodontosaurus was named in 1962 and it, Lycorhinus and Geranosaurus were recognized as closely related ornithischian dinosaurs. Alfred Romer named Heterodontosauridae in 1966 as a family of ornithischian dinosaurs including Heterodontosaurus and Lycorhinus. Kuhn independently proposed Heterodontosauridae in the same year and is sometimes cited as its principal author. It was defined as a clade in 1998 by Paul Sereno and redefined by him in 2005 as the stem clade consisting of Heterodontosaurus tucki and all species more closely related to Heterodontosaurus than to Parasaurolophus walkeri, Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis, Triceratops horridus, or Ankylosaurus magniventris. Heterodontosauridae includes the genera Abrictosaurus, Lycorhinus, and Heterodontosaurus, all from South Africa. While Richard Thulborn once reassigned all three to Lycorhinus, all other authors consider the three genera distinct. Within the family, Heterodontosaurus and Lycorhinus are considered sister taxa, with Abrictosaurus as a basal member. Geranosaurus is also a heterodontosaurid, but is usually considered a nomen dubium because the type specimen is missing all its teeth, making it indistinguishable from any other genus in the family. More recently, the genus Echinodon has been considered a heterodontosaurid in several studies. Lanasaurus was named for an upper jaw in 1975, but more recent discoveries have shown that it belongs to Lycorhinus instead, making Lanasaurus a junior synonym of that genus. Dianchungosaurus was once considered a heterodontosaurid from Asia, but it has since been shown that the remains were a chimera of prosauropod and mesoeucrocodylian remains. Jos\u00e9 Bonaparte also classified the South American Pisanosaurus as a heterodontosaurid at one time, but this animal is now known to be a more basal ornithischian. The membership of Heterodontosauridae is well-established in comparison to its uncertain phylogenetic position. Several early studies suggested that heterodontosaurids were very primitive ornithischians. Due to supposed similarities in the morphology of the forelimbs, Robert Bakker proposed a relationship between heterodontosaurids and early sauropodomorphs like Anchisaurus, bridging the orders Saurischia and Ornithischia. The dominant hypothesis over the last several decades has placed heterodontosaurids as basal ornithopods.","h_score":1729578.2562500001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":5872429,"revid":1172505180,"description":"Extinct family of dinosaurs","categories":["Early Cretaceous extinctions","Heterodontosaurids","Norian first appearances","Prehistoric dinosaur families","Taxa named by Alfred Romer"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Unearthing Heterodontosauridae: The Toothy Dinosaurs of the Jurassic\n\nHeterodontosauridae, a family of small early dinosaurs, are famed for their mixed teeth adapted for various foods, offering a window into prehistoric life.

The Mahabharata, Harivamsa and Devi Bhagavata Purana assert that Satyavati was the daughter of a cursed apsara (celestial nymph) named Adrika. Adrika was transformed by a curse into a fish and lived in the Yamuna river. According to the legend, Vasu (also known as Uparicara Vasu), a Chedi King, was on a hunting expedition when he had a nocturnal emission while dreaming of his wife. Using an eagle, He sent his semen to his queen but due to fighting mid-air with another eagle, the semen fell into the river and was swallowed by the cursed Adrika-fish. Consequently, the fish became pregnant. Soon, A fisherman caught the pregnant fish and cut it open to find two babies in the womb of the fish, one male and one female. The fisherman presented the children to the king, who kept the male child. The boy grew up to become King Matsya, the founder of the Matsya Kingdom. The king gave the female child back to the fisherman, naming her Matsya-gandha (\"She who smells like fish\"). The fisherman raised the girl as his daughter and named her Kali (\"the dark one\") because of her complexion. Over the course of time, Kali earned the name Satyavati (\"truthful\"). The fisherman was also a ferryman, ferrying people across the river in his boat.

Roosevelt. She arrived at Annapolis, Maryland, on 22 December 1941, made a shakedown cruise to Bermuda in January 1942, and departed for Scapa Flow on 17 January with Churchill returning home by air. On 1 March 1942, she provided close escort for Convoy PQ 12 in company with the battlecruiser Renown, the cruiser Kenya, and six destroyers. On 6 March, that force was reinforced with one of Duke of York's sister-ships, King George V, and the aircraft carrier Victorious, the heavy cruiser Berwick, and six destroyers as a result of Admiral John Tovey's concerns that the battleship German battleship Tirpitz might attempt to intercept the convoy. On 6 March, the German battleship put to sea and was sighted by a British submarine around 19:40; no contact was made, however, except for an unsuccessful aerial torpedo attack by aircraft from Victorious. Later that month, Convoy PQ 13 was constituted and Duke of York again formed part of the escort force. In early April, Duke of York, King George V, and the carrier Victorious formed the core of a support force that patrolled between Iceland and Norway to cover several convoys to the Soviet Union. In late April, when King George V accidentally rammed and sank the destroyer Punjabi in dense fog, sustaining significant bow damage, Duke of York was sent to relieve her. She continued in these operations through May, when she was joined by the American battleship USS Washington. In mid-September, Duke of York escorted Convoy QP 14. In October 1942, Duke of York was sent to Gibraltar as the new flagship of Force H, and supported the Allied landings in North Africa the following month. During this time Duke of York came under air attack by Italian aircraft on several occasions, but the raids were relatively small scale and were swiftly dealt with by the \"umbrella\" provided by the aircraft from the accompanying carriers Victorious, Formidable and Furious. After this action, Duke of York returned to Britain for a refit. With her refit completed, Duke of York resumed her status as flagship from 14 May 1943 pending the departure of King George V and Howe for Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. Operation Gearbox in June 1943 involved a sweep by Duke of York and Anson, in company with the US battleships USS Alabama and South Dakota, to provide distant cover for minor operations in Spitsbergen and the Kola Inlet, while the following month diversionary operations, code-named \"Camera\" and \"Governor of Norway,\" were carried out in order to draw the Germans' attention away from Operation Husky. On 4 October, Duke of York and Anson covered a force of Allied cruisers and destroyers and the American carrier USS Ranger under Operation Leader, which raided German shipping off Norway. The attack resulted in the sinking of four German merchant ships and damage to seven others, which forced many of them to be grounded.","h_score":1710180.2562500001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":485618,"revid":1162203712,"description":"King George V-class battleship of the Royal Navy","categories":["1940 ships","King George V-class battleships (1939)","Ships built on the River Clyde","World War II battleships of the United Kingdom"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is HMS Duke of York (17)?  \nA1: HMS Duke of York was a British battleship from World War II, part of the King George V class, known for its imposing steel frame and powerful guns.\n\nQ2: When and where was it launched?  \nA2: It was launched in 1937 at the Vickers-Armstrong shipyard in Newcastle, England, emerging as a symbol of naval might amid rising tensions.\n\nQ3: What was its primary role in the war?  \nA3: As a battleship, it patrolled the Atlantic and engaged enemy fleets, showcasing Britain's seafaring prowess with its speed and firepower.\n\nQ4: Which major battle did it fight in?  \nA4: It played a key role in the Battle of the North Cape in 1943, helping sink the German battleship Scharnhorst in icy waters.\n\nQ5: What were its main armaments?  \nA5: The ship featured ten 14-inch guns in twin turrets, plus anti-aircraft weapons, making it a formidable floating fortress against air and sea threats.\n\nQ6: How did it compare to other ships of its era?  \nA6: It was advanced for its time with radar and armor, outpacing older designs while balancing speed and strength on the waves.\n\nQ7: What happened to it after the war?  \nA7: Decommissioned in 1951, it was scrapped in 1957, ending its storied career as a relic of wartime glory.\n\nQ8: What is its historical significance?  \nA8: HMS Duke of York exemplified Britain's naval innovation, influencing future designs and symbolizing resilience in the fight for freedom."}

The Northern Celestial Masters were a continuation of the Way as it had been practiced in Sichuan province by Zhang Lu and his followers.

Kou Qianzhi, from a family who followed the Celestial Master, brought a new version of Celestial Master Daoism to the Northern Wei. The Northern Wei government embraced his form of Daoism and established it as the state religion, thereby creating a new Daoist theocracy that lasted until 450 CE. The arrival of Buddhism had great influence on the Northern Celestial Masters, bringing monasticism and influencing the diet of practitioners. Art produced in areas dominated by the Northern Celestial Masters also began to show Buddhist influence. When the theocracy collapsed, many Daoists fled to Louguan, which quickly became an important religious center.

Although Plante had used his mask in practice since 1956 after missing 13 games because of a sinusitis operation, head coach Toe Blake was afraid it would impair his vision and would not permit him to wear it during regulation play. However, on November 1, 1959, Plante's nose was broken when he was hit by a shot fired by Andy Bathgate three minutes into a game against the New York Rangers, and he was taken to the dressing room for stitches. When he returned, he was wearing the crude home-made goaltender mask that he had been using in practices. Blake was livid, but he had no other goaltender to call upon and Plante refused to return to the goal unless he wore the mask. Blake agreed on the condition that Plante discard the mask when the cut healed. The Canadiens won the game 3\u20131. During the following days Plante refused to discard the mask, and as the Canadiens continued to win, Blake was less vocal about it. The unbeaten streak stretched to 18 games. Plante did not wear the mask, at Blake's request, against Detroit on March 8, 1960; the Canadiens lost 3\u20130, and the mask returned for good the next night. That year the Canadiens won their fifth straight Stanley Cup, which was Plante's last.\n\nPlante subsequently designed his own and other goaltenders' masks. He was not the first NHL goaltender known to wear a face mask.

When the Battle of Trafalgar was joined on 21 October, Harvey's Temeraire was the second ship in Nelson's division and was a faster and more agile ship than HMS Victory, Nelson's flagship. As a result, Temeraire began to pull ahead of Victory as the division closed on the Franco-Spanish fleet and Harvey was consequently reprimanded by Nelson, who hailed Temeraire: \"I will thank you Captain Harvey, to keep your proper station which is astern of the Victory\".\n\nDuring the combat that followed, Harvey was heavily engaged with the enemy, passing behind Bucentaure and astern of Redoutable. The broadside fired into Redoutable reduced the French ship to a wreck and forced its surrender soon afterwards when it became tangled with Victory and Temeraire. The three ships then drifted into the following French Fougueux, British fire disabling her and giving cover to a boarding party led by Temeraire's first-lieutenant, Thomas Fortescue Kennedy, which forced the surrender of Fougueux'''s crew. In later years Harvey would use this incident for his personal motto \"Redoutable et Fougueux\".\n\nOnce the fleet had returned to port, controversy erupted concerning Harvey's role in the battle. Although his bravery and skill were not questioned, his prominence in the dispatch sent home by Cuthbert Collingwood was. In the dispatch, Harvey was singled out over the other captains for his bravery, Collingwood writing: \"I have not words in which I can sufficiently express my admiration of it\". As a result of this special mention, Harvey was promoted to rear-admiral on 9 November 1805, and given the honour of being one of Nelson's pallbearers at the admiral's funeral despite their short acquaintance. Harvey's new motto and his penchant for \"bragging\" further alienated him from his fellow officers.\n\n","h_score":1690643.40625,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":7292320,"revid":1169175952,"description":"British Royal Navy admiral and politician","categories":["1758 births","1830 deaths","British MPs 1780\u20131784","Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath","Members of Parliament for Maldon","Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies","Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies","People educated at Harrow School","People educated at Westminster School, London","People from Chigwell","Royal Navy admirals","Royal Navy captains at the Battle of Trafalgar","Royal Navy personnel of the American Revolutionary War","Royal Navy personnel of the French Revolutionary Wars","Royal Navy personnel of the Napoleonic Wars","UK MPs 1802\u20131806","UK MPs 1806\u20131807","UK MPs 1807\u20131812","UK MPs 1820\u20131826","UK MPs 1826\u20131830"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Eliab Harvey?  \nA1: Eliab Harvey was a British naval officer, born in 1758, who rose to admiral rank.  \n\nQ2: What was his naval role?  \nA2: He commanded ships like HMS Temeraire, sailing the high seas with disciplined flair.  \n\nQ3: When did he live?  \nA3: He lived from 1758 to 1834, a era of roaring cannons and naval glory.  \n\nQ4: What battles did he fight?  \nA4: Harvey fought in the Napoleonic Wars, notably at Trafalgar's stormy clash.  \n\nQ5: How did he contribute at Trafalgar?  \nA5: He led HMS Temeraire into fierce combat, bolstering Britain's victory with bold maneuvers.  \n\nQ6: What honors did he earn?  \nA6: He received knighthood and various awards, reflecting his valor on turbulent waves.  \n\nQ7: What was his legacy?  \nA7: Harvey's service inspired naval tales, symbolizing Britain's seafaring spirit and strategy.  \n\nQ8: Why remember him today?  \nA8: His exploits highlight courage in conflict, offering lessons on leadership in history's vast tides."}

With 15,000 square metres (160,000 sq ft) of floor space it had seven gates, of which five had jetbridges. The two remaining gates were fitted with jetbridges in July 2012. V\u00e6rnes became the first airport in the Nordic countries with a train station in the terminal, when Trondheim Airport Station opened. In March 1996, the old terminal was named Terminal B and all international flights were moved there. A new taxiway, which extended the full length of the runway, was opened in 1999, after more artificial land has been created and a second tunnel built for the highway and railway. Oslo Airport, Gardermoen opened on 8 October 1998, replacing the congested Fornebu. For the first time, an airline could receive sufficient landing slots to challenge SAS and Braathens on domestic routes. The low-cost carrier Color Air was established, and started flights from Oslo to Trondheim using Boeing 737-300 aircraft. SAS and Braathens also saw the opportunity to increase the frequency on the route, and the three airlines between them introduced 39 daily flights. This made the route the fourth-busiest in Europe in terms of the number of aircraft. During this period, there were 84 daily departures to all destinations from V\u00e6rnes. Color Air filed for bankruptcy on 27 September 1999, ending a price war which had cost the airlines NOK 3 billion. By April 2000, the number of services by the main airlines was reduced to less than the level before the opening of Gardermoen, with 75 daily departures. Braathens had 33 daily departures, SAS had 22 and Wider\u00f8e had 20. Of Braathens' services, 14 were to Oslo, 15 to cities on the West Coast (of which four were operated by Norwegian Air Shuttle) and four were to Bod\u00f8, Harstad\/Narvik and Troms\u00f8. SAS operated 15 daily flights to Oslo, while eight were operated to Bod\u00f8, Harstad\/Narvik and Troms\u00f8. One flight was to their main hub in Copenhagen. This was the last year that SAS used DC-9s to Trondheim, phasing in Boeing 737 Next Generation aircraft, supplemented by occasional MD-80s. Wider\u00f8e had 15 daily flights to STOLports in Helgeland, and five flights to Sandefjord. In 2002, SAS acquired Braathens, and the two companies coordinated their routes. All flights from Trondheim to Oslo-Gardermoen were taken over by SAS, who increased to 23 departures per day in each direction. This included a 30-minute headway from 06:30 to 09:30 and from 15:30 to 19:00. This made the route Trondheim\u2013Oslo the busiest in the country. The routes northwards were taken over by Braathens, who increased to six daily trips to Bod\u00f8 with connections northwards. The daily trip with Braathens to Harstad\/Narvik was replaced by a two-round trips with SAS Commuter.","h_score":1714312.7250000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":303381,"revid":1173849262,"description":"International airport serving Trondheim, Norway","categories":["1914 establishments in Norway","Airports established in 1914","Airports in Tr\u00f8ndelag","Avinor airports","International airports in Norway","Stj\u00f8rdal","Transport in Trondheim"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Trondheim Airport: Norway's Vital Gateway\n\nTrondheim Airport serves as a key hub for central Norway, facilitating both domestic and international flights.

However, Gray did not furnish the name with a proper description, rendering it a nomen nudum. In December 1854, American ichthyologist William Orville Ayres gave a lecture describing the species as Mustelus felis, which included the first scientific description of the species. His lecture was reprinted first in The Pacific, a San Francisco newspaper, and then in the journal Proceedings of the California Academy of Natural Sciences. In April 1855, French biologist Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Girard published another description of this species, naming it Triakis semifasciata.\n\nDespite M. felis being the senior synonym, an error in recording the dates of publication resulted in the widespread use of T. semifasciata as the leopard shark's scientific name. As a result of this long-standing error, Triakis semifasciata came to be recognized as the valid name (as a nomen protectum) and Mustelis felis was invalidated (as a nomen oblitum). The specific epithet semifasciata comes from the Latin words semi (\"half\") and fasciatus (\"banded\"), describing this shark's dorsal pattern of saddle-like markings. In older literature, this species may be referred to as \"tiger shark\" or \"catshark\".\n\nThe genus Triakis contains two subgenera, Triakis and Cazon. The leopard shark is placed within the subgenus Triakis along with the banded houndshark (T. (Triakis) scyllium). A 2006 phylogenetic analysis by J. Andr\u00e9s L\u00f3pez and colleagues, based on protein-coding genes, revealed that Triakis and Cazon are in fact not closely related, and additionally that the leopard shark may be the most basal member of its family.\n\n","h_score":1740480.8687500001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":4269360,"revid":1138478260,"description":"Species of shark","categories":["Fauna of California","Fauna of the Baja California Peninsula","Fish described in 1855","Fish of Mexico","Fish of North America","Fish of the Gulf of California","Fish of the United States","Fish of the Western United States","Marine fauna of North America","Taxa named by Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Girard","Triakis","Viviparous fish","Western North American coastal fauna"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Leopard Sharks: Nature's Spotted Enigmas\n\nThe leopard shark, with its bold black spots on a silvery canvas, thrives in Pacific coastal waters as a gentle predator.

Kondracki wanted her first project to concern sex trafficking but was unsure how to create a moving, original plot. Her mother was born in Ukraine, and she was aware of what she described as the country's \"epidemic\" of trafficking. Victor Malarek's book The Natashas inspired her to produce a film on the subject. She said of her initiative being a challenge, \"No one wants to watch a film of an enslaved girl being raped for two hours.\" Bolkovac's experiences gave Kondracki a framework for the film and added the themes of corruption and wide-scale cover-ups. Film critic Rex Reed said that the abuse of power featured prominently in The Whistleblower; a number of government officials participate in the sex trade or turn a blind eye to it (including peacekeepers, UN members and mercenaries). Wallace Baine of the Santa Cruz Sentinel wrote that these aspects' portrayal made the movie \"slippery and true-to-life\". She said, \"There are clear and vivid monsters in this film, but there are also those existing in the shades-of-gray middle, nice-enough guys tolerating crimes of unspeakable barbarity.\" Justice, another prominent theme, does not materialize by the end. The sex trafficking victim Raya is killed, and none of the peacekeepers who participated in the trafficking are prosecuted (although several are sent home). According to Baine, viewers are left with the impression that \"the worst violence in Bolkovac's story was the violence done to justice\".\n\nBolkovac is portrayed as imperfect\u2014a \"noble but screwed up\" individual. In the film (which roughly mirrors her real life), her personal life is in disarray. She has lost custody of her children to her ex-husband and goes to Bosnia to earn money to move closer to them. While there, she has an affair with a fellow peacekeeper. Kondracki wanted to promote the idea of an average protagonist who acted against injustice while her peers looked the other way. Her flaws are offset by her determination to fight the sex trade, and reviewers found these aspects instrumental in making her a three-dimensional character.\n\nWeisz compared Bolkovac's story of \"one lone woman fighting injustice\" to that of David and Goliath, her favorite film genre. In the film, as in real life, Bolkovac begins by investigating a case of a kidnapped girl. As the story unfolds, she discovers a wide-ranging web of corruption and faces growing obstacles. The sex trade is facilitated by a large, influential organization. When she tries to report her findings to the UN and local officials, she receives threats and is \"shunned by coworkers and thwarted by higher-ups\". Weisz explained that she liked the idea of an ordinary person doing something extraordinary. She said, \"I love that kind of thriller, the ordinary person who, because of their character, it's their character that leads them.\"\n\n ## Release\n\nThe Whistleblower premiered on 13 September 2010, at the 2010 Toronto Film Festival. Screenings were also held at film festivals in North America, including the 2011 Human Rights Watch Film Festival in New York.\n\nA screening was held for The Whistleblower in Bosnia-Herzegovina for the first time in March 2014. The film was shown in Sarajevo and Mostar, with Kathryn Bolkovac being invited to speak to the Bosnian audience.\n\n ### Box office\n\nSamuel Goldwyn Films purchased rights to distribute the film in the United States. The film had a limited release starting on 5 August 2011. It initially screened in seven theaters and expanded to a maximum of 70 theaters before drawing down. Its theatrical run lasted 12 weeks, during which it grossed \\$1.1 million.\n\n","h_score":1726363.6812500001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":25245866,"revid":1173362022,"description":"2010 Canadian-German thriller film directed by Larysa Kondracki","categories":["2010 biographical drama films","2010 crime drama films","2010 directorial debut films","2010 films","2010 thriller films","2010s Canadian films","2010s English-language films","2010s feminist films","Canadian biographical drama films","Canadian crime drama films","Canadian thriller films","Crime films based on actual events","Drama films based on actual events","English-language Canadian films","English-language German films","English-language biographical drama films","Films about human trafficking","Films about the United Nations","Films about whistleblowing","Films set in Sarajevo","Films shot in Romania","Human trafficking in Bosnia and Herzegovina","Thriller films based on actual events","Voltage Pictures films"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is a whistleblower?  \nA1: A whistleblower is someone who exposes hidden wrongdoing in organizations.

Brood War'''s gameplay remains fundamentally unchanged from that of StarCraft, although it made small alterations to unit costs and some abilities, and added some new units. These changes make rushing tactics\u2014a factor that gained some criticism in the original StarCraft\u2014less practical. The single-player campaign has an increased difficulty; missions are no longer entirely linear, and a greater focus on strategy is needed to complete missions. In addition, the game's artificial intelligence (AI) has been augmented so that AI-controlled players are more intelligent and tend to use tactics more effectively.\n\nBrood War introduces seven new units. Each race is given access to a unique ground unit: the Zerg can create a defensive unit that can attack from the concealment of its burrow, while the Terrans can train combat medics. The Protoss are able to produce dark templar units, a powerful cloaked melee unit only given to the player in special missions of StarCraft. Protoss players can merge two of these units to create a special spellcaster unit. Each race is also given access to a dedicated air-to-air attack unit.\n\n ## Synopsis\n\n ### Setting\n\nBrood War takes place in the StarCraft universe, set around the early 26th century. Terran exiles from Earth have colonized a distant area of the Milky Way galaxy called the Koprulu Sector, having established several governments. Eventually, a civil war breaks out and ends with the formation of the Terran Dominion. However, humanity soon becomes caught in a war between the Protoss and the Zerg, which culminates at the end of StarCraft with the death of the Zerg leader, the Overmind, on the Protoss homeworld of Aiur. Without the Overmind to command, the Zerg rampage mindlessly across Aiur, while the cerebrates\u2014the secondary commanders of the Swarm\u2014attempt to regain control. After the discovery of alien life in the Koprulu Sector, the United Earth Directorate (UED)\u2014the international body governing Earth\u2014decides to send an expeditionary force to secure the sector and prevent the aliens from finding Earth. Brood War begins two days after the conclusion of StarCraft.\n\n ### Characters\n\nThe player assumes the roles of three anonymous characters over the course of the game. In the first campaign, the player assumes the role of a Protoss fleet commander. The player's character is commanded by Zeratul and Aldaris, two adversaries from StarCraft who have since reconciled their differences to lead their people in the face of the rampaging Zerg. They are joined by Jim Raynor, a Terran rebel on the run from the Dominion, Artanis, the previous Executor of the third campaign of StarCraft who has recently been promoted, and Raszagal, the matriarch of the dissident dark templar faction in Protoss society. The second campaign sees the player as a captain in the UED expeditionary force, reporting to the fleet's admiral Gerard DuGalle and his vice-admiral Alexei Stukov. To secure the sector, the UED plans to overthrow the Terran Dominion and its emperor Arcturus Mengsk, and are assisted in this by Samir Duran, a mysterious psionic ghost espionage agent, and his group of anti-Dominion rebels. The final campaign has the player assume the position of a Zerg cerebrate, a commander within the Zerg Swarm. The player is put under the control of Sarah Kerrigan, a Terran who was infested by the Zerg in StarCraft.\n\n","h_score":1690981.1812500001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":635841,"revid":1151678846,"description":"Expansion pack for StarCraft","categories":["1998 video games","Classic Mac OS games","Esports games","MacOS games","Multiplayer and single-player video games","Multiplayer null modem games","Saffire games","StarCraft games","Video game expansion packs","Video games developed in the United States","Video games with isometric graphics","Video games written by Chris Metzen","Windows games"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### StarCraft: Brood War's Lasting Impact\n\nStarCraft: Brood War is the 1998 expansion to the original StarCraft game, adding new units, campaigns, and strategic depth.

Some of the Twilight Zone episodes parodied include \"A Kind of a Stopwatch\", \"To Serve Man\", \"A Small Talent for War\", \"Living Doll\", \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\", \"Little Girl Lost\", and \"The Little People\". The \"Bart's Nightmare\" segment of \"Treehouse of Horror II\" parodies the episode \"It's a Good Life\" and is even presented in a format similar to an episode of The Twilight Zone.\n\nHorror and thriller films parodied include The Exorcist, The Amityville Horror, King Kong, Night of the Living Dead, The Shining, A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Fly, Paranormal Activity, and Dead Calm. Robert Englund had a cameo appearance in \"Treehouse of Horror IX\" as his character from A Nightmare on Elm Street, Freddy Krueger. Science fiction films have also occasionally been used as inspiration for segments, and in later episodes, many of the segments were based more on science fiction than horror. Science fiction works parodied include The Omega Man, the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, The Island of Doctor Moreau, and Orson Welles's The War of the Worlds radio broadcast. In \"Treehouse of Horror\", Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"The Raven\" is read by James Earl Jones, while the parts are acted by various characters.\n\nRecent parodies have included films and television specials in more varied genres, including Mr. & Mrs. Smith, It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown, Transformers, Sweeney Todd, the Twilight film series, and Jumanji.\n\n ### Closing logos\n\nA modified version of the production logo for Gracie Films is displayed after the closing credits. The shushing sound is replaced by either a scream or another sound effect from the episode, and the jingle is played in a minor key on a pipe organ. The first three episodes did not feature the scream. \"Treehouse of Horror VI\" and \"Treehouse of Horror XIX\" did not feature the organ or scream; the former incorporated a Myst homage and the latter used a piano rendition following its parody of Peanuts.

The attacker, Mateu Morral, acting on a desire to spur revolution, threw a bomb concealed in a floral bouquet from a Madrid hotel window as the King's procession passed, killing 24 bystanders and soldiers and wounding over 100 others, while leaving the royals unscathed. Morral sought refuge from republican journalist Jos\u00e9 Nakens but fled in the night to Torrej\u00f3n de Ardoz, whose villagers reported the interloper. Two days after the attack, militiamen accosted Morral, who killed one before killing himself. Morral was likely involved in a similar attack on the king a year earlier.\n\nThe affair became a pretext to stop Francisco Ferrer, an anarchist pedagogue who ran Escuela Moderna, the influential, rationalist, antigovernment, anticlerical, antimilitary, Barcelonean school in whose library Morral worked. An unrequited love interest from the school might also have influenced Morral. Ferrer was charged with masterminding the attack, and though he was acquitted for lack of evidence, he remained a target of the government and church. The journalist Nakens and two friends, however, received prison sentences, held partially responsible for the murder Morral committed after fleeing the city. Following a prominent campaign for royal pardon, the three were released within a year of sentencing. Nakens' role in the affair spotlighted fissures in the Spanish republican movement between gradualism and near-term revolution that would later become an identity crisis.\n\n","h_score":1747084.7000000002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":57148641,"revid":1144514603,"description":"1906 attempted murder of King Alfonso XIII and Victoria Eugenie","categories":["1900s in Madrid","1900s murders in Spain","1906 crimes in Spain","1906 in Spain","1906 murders in Europe","Alfonso XIII of Spain","Anarchism in Spain","Crime in Madrid","Failed regicides"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the Morral affair?  \nA1: It was an assassination attempt on King Alfonso XIII of Spain in 1906.  \n\nQ2: When and where did it occur?  \nA2: It happened in Madrid during the king's wedding procession.  \n\nQ3: Who was Mateo Morral?  \nA3: He was an anarchist who carried out the attack.  \n\nQ4: What method was used?  \nA4: Morral threw a bomb at the royal carriage.  \n\nQ5: Did the attempt succeed?  \nA5: It failed to kill the king but caused several deaths.  \n\nQ6: What were the immediate consequences?  \nA6: It led to arrests and heightened security measures.  \n\nQ7: How did it affect Spanish politics?  \nA7: It intensified anti-anarchist sentiments and repression.  \n\nQ8: What is its historical significance?  \nA8: It highlighted early 20th-century tensions in Europe."}

The largely instrumental \"One of These Days\" is followed by \"A Pillow of Winds\", which is distinguished by being one of the few quiet, acoustic love songs in the Pink Floyd catalogue. These two songs segue into each other across windy sound effects, anticipating the technique that would later be used on Wish You Were Here. The title of \"A Pillow of Winds\" was inspired by the games of Mahjong that Waters, Mason, and their wives played while in the south of France. \"One of These Days\" was developed around an ostinato bassline created by Roger Waters, by feeding the output through a Binson Echorec. The bassline was performed by Waters and Gilmour using two bass guitars, one on old strings. Drummer Nick Mason's abstruse \"One of these days I'm going to cut you into little pieces\" vocal line was recorded at double speed using a falsetto voice, and replayed at normal speed. The song \"Fearless\" includes field recordings of Liverpool F.C. fans in the Kop singing club anthem \"You'll Never Walk Alone\", which brings the song to an end in a heavily reverberated fade-out. \"San Tropez\", by contrast, is a jazz-inflected pop song with a shuffle tempo, composed by Waters in his increasingly deployed style of breezy, off-the-cuff songwriting. The song was inspired by the band's trip to the south of France in 1970. Pink Floyd uncharacteristically displayed their sense of humour with \"Seamus\", a pseudo-blues novelty track featuring Steve Marriott's dog (whom Gilmour was dog-sitting) howling along to the music. Although \"Seamus\" often tops polls of the worst songs Pink Floyd ever created, the band would use animal sounds again on Animals (albeit as part of the concept of the album). The final song on the album is the 23-minute \"Echoes\". First performed as \"Return of the Son of Nothing\" on 22 April 1971 in Norwich, the band spent about three months on the track in three studios (Morgan, AIR and EMI). \"Echoes\" began with a studio experiment involving Richard Wright's piano. Wright had fed a single note through a Leslie speaker, producing a submarine-like ping. The band tried repeatedly to recreate this sound in the studio but were unsuccessful, and so the demo version was used on what would later become \"Echoes\", mixed almost exclusively at AIR Studios. Combined with David Gilmour's guitar, the band were able to develop the track further, experimenting with accidental sound effects (such as Gilmour's guitar being plugged into a wah-wah pedal back to front, an effect they used live from 1970 for the central section of \u201cEmbryo\u201d). Unlike with Atom Heart Mother, the new multi-track capabilities of the studio enabled them to create the track in stages, rather than performing it in a single take. The final, 23-minute piece would eventually take up the entire second side of the album. \"Echoes\" also gave its name to the compilation album Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd, on which a much-edited version of the title track was included. On the compilation, multiple edits throughout the entire song cut the running length of the piece down by some seven minutes. Some of the material composed during the creation of Meddle was not used; however, one song would eventually become \"Brain Damage\", on The Dark Side of the Moon. ## Packaging\n\nThe album's title Meddle is a play on words: a medal, and to interfere. Storm Thorgerson of the art-design group Hipgnosis originally suggested a close-up shot of a baboon's anus for the album cover photograph. He was overruled by the band, who informed him via an intercontinental telephone call while on tour in Japan that they would rather have \"an ear underwater\". The cover image was photographed by Bob Dowling. The image represents an ear, underwater, collecting waves of sound (represented by ripples in the water). Thorgerson later expressed dissatisfaction with the cover, claiming it to be his least favourite Pink Floyd album sleeve: \"I think Meddle is a much better album than its cover\". Thorgerson's colleague Aubrey Powell shared his sentiments, saying: \"Meddle was a mess. I hated that cover. I don't think we did them justice with that at all; it's half-hearted.\" The gatefold contains a group photograph of the band, which would be their last until 1987's A Momentary Lapse of Reason.\n\n ## Release\n\nMeddle was released on 30 October 1971 in the US, and 5 November in the UK. It was later released as a remastered LP by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab, and in April 1989 on their \"Ultradisc\" gold CD format. The album was included as part of the box set Shine On on 2 November 1992.\n\nAlthough in the UK it reached number three, lacklustre publicity on the part of Capitol Records led to weak sales in the US, and a chart position of number 70. \"Pink Floyd had a strong following in the UK and other parts of Europe,\" recalled Rupert Perry, then head of A&R at Capitol. \"But they needed to be bigger in the United States, where they were only doing 200,000 units. They were very much an album act \u2013 no singles \u2013 which was bad news for us. They had a high credibility factor without the sales.\"\n\nOn 29 November 1971, \"One of These Days\" was released as a 7-inch single in the US, with \"Fearless\" on the B-side. \"One of These Days\" and \"Echoes\" were performed during Live At Pompeii (the latter in two parts) and also on the BBC's 1971 In Concert. Meddle was later certified gold by the RIAA on 29 October 1973 and then double platinum on 11 March 1994, following the added attention garnered by the band's later successes in the United States.\n\n","h_score":1743195.0562500001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":303876,"revid":1171966828,"description":null,"categories":["1971 albums","Albums produced by David Gilmour","Albums produced by Nick Mason","Albums produced by Richard Wright (musician)","Albums produced by Roger Waters","Albums recorded at AIR Studios","Albums recorded at Morgan Sound Studios","Albums with cover art by Hipgnosis","Albums with cover art by Storm Thorgerson","Capitol Records albums","EMI Records albums","Harvest Records albums","Pink Floyd albums"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Meddle?  \nA1: Meddle is Pink Floyd's 1971 album, a psychedelic rock gem blending experimental sounds.  \n\nQ2: Who created it?  \nA2: Pink Floyd, with David Gilmour on guitar and Roger Waters on bass leading the band.  \n\nQ3: When was it released?  \nA3: In November 1971, marking a pivotal shift in their style.  \n\nQ4: What are key tracks?  \nA4: \"Echoes\" stands out for its epic, echoing waves of sound.  \n\nQ5: What themes does it explore?  \nA5: Themes of isolation and nature weave through, like ripples in a pond.  \n\nQ6: How was it received?  \nA6: Critics praised its innovation, though it initially sold modestly.  \n\nQ7: What makes it influential?  \nA7: Its experimental production shaped progressive rock's evolution.  \n\nQ8: What's its lasting legacy?  \nA8: Meddle echoes in modern music, a timeless bridge to Pink Floyd's future hits."}

The gimbaling motion was used to control the flight path of the missile, replacing the system of the V-2 missile that used moving fins placed within a fixed engine. The gimbal system adds complexity to the engine mounting but preserves more of the energy of the rocket exhaust during maneuvering. The engine had a specific impulse of 210 s at sea level.\n\nThe Hiroc missile used liquid oxygen as its oxidizer, and alcohol for its fuel. The Hiroc missile did not have separate tanks for its fuel and oxidizer, which were instead contained in one tank separated by two bulkheads. The airframe of the rocket was supported by nitrogen gas pressure inside the tank, which could contain propellant or nitrogen gas when stored. Having gas pressure provide rigidity to the structure reduced the empty weight by requiring less metallic components for structural reinforcement, but made the missile fragile because it required continuous pressurization. The RTV-A-2 Hiroc had an airframe to propellant ratio three times better than the V-2.\n\nThe nose cone, which contained instrumentation, would separate from the rocket booster. This made the rocket lighter as only the nose cone and its instruments and recording camera had to be able to survive recovery, rather than the entire rocket. The unique innovations of the Hiroc missiles, such as the gimbaled thrust chambers, and the internal pressure supported airframe, would go on to be utilized in the Atlas rockets. Several changes were made in the Atlas, such as the aluminum used for the missiles airframe of the Hiroc, was changed to stainless steel in the Atlas. The early Atlas utilized the MX-774 project developed Azusa interferometry based guidance system which served Cape Canaveral during the early space age. The engines of the Atlas missiles were also much more powerful, generating a total of 150,000 lbf (670 kN) of thrust, compared to the Hiroc's total of 8,000 lbf (36 kN) thrust.\n\n","h_score":1722044.7375,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":4885910,"revid":1162957622,"description":"20th-century US research project","categories":["Atlas (rocket family)","Ballistic missiles of the Cold War","Experimental rockets of the United States","Intercontinental ballistic missiles of the United States"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is RTV-A-2 Hiroc?  \nA1: RTV-A-2 Hiroc is a Cold War-era American surface-to-air missile, designed for high-altitude defense like a vigilant sky guardian.\n\nQ2: When was it developed?  \nA2: It was developed in the late 1940s by Hughes Aircraft, entering service by the early 1950s as a key defense tool.\n\nQ3: What was its primary purpose?  \nA3: Its main role was intercepting enemy aircraft, providing a robust shield against aerial threats in military operations.\n\nQ4: How did it function?  \nA4: It used radar guidance to track and destroy targets, launching with precision like a swift arrow in the sky.\n\nQ5: What were its key features?  \nA5: Features included solid fuel propulsion and explosive warheads, making it effective yet compact for deployment.\n\nQ6: Was it used in conflicts?  \nA6: It saw action in the Korean War, demonstrating its reliability in real combat scenarios.\n\nQ7: What made it significant?  \nA7: It advanced missile technology, influencing later designs and symbolizing early Cold War innovation.\n\nQ8: What is its legacy today?  \nA8: Though obsolete, it paved the way for modern air defense systems, reminding us of evolving warfare strategies."}

Although these species also grow elsewhere, they are generally sparsely distributed and far smaller and younger than the coral growth on Davidson. Conversely, sea cucumbers, which are very common on the walls of Monterey Canyon, are all but absent on Davidson, an example of the polarity between Davidson and Monterey Bay.\n\nResearchers speculate that Davidson Seamount is an ideal habitat for deep-sea corals and sponges because it has favorable bottom rock (bare lava rock), a steady food supply (supplied by a water current favoring the seamount; see the section above), and has not been disturbed by strong bottom currents than often bother other seafloor areas.\n\nCraig McClain, one of the scientists studying the seamount, told PhysOrg:\n\n> \"The large groves of corals and sponges are unique to seamounts. The crests of seamounts are particularly good because they provide flat rocky surfaces that don't accumulate much sediment. This is partly due to the fact that seamounts are so far offshore. In contrast when you look at the seafloor in Monterey Canyon, it's mucky. That makes it tough for filter feeders, especially sponges. Any flat surface in the canyon collects mud. This makes it tough for corals to settle anywhere except on near-vertical surfaces.

The seamounts are likely to be a source of larvae that maintains the population of the species in nearby, sub-optimal areas, known as \"sinks.\" Sinks are low-lying areas in which species can live, but do so very poorly; if they are not replenished by nearby population centers, such as at Davidson, they could disappear from the area entirely.

The ground was also used as a cricket pitch during the summer by the East Suffolk Cricket Club who had played there since 1855. The cricket club had erected a pavilion, the first fixed building at the ground. More substantial elements of ground development did not begin for a further 11 years, though Ipswich became one of the first clubs to implement the use of goal nets in 1890. At this time, Ipswich were an amateur side (the team became professional in 1936) and the first visit of a professional club came in 1892, when Preston North End played a Suffolk County Football Association team. This was followed six years later by a visit from Aston Villa, a game which was so popular that a temporary stand was erected in order to accommodate a crowd of around 5,000. In 1901, a tobacco processing plant was built along the south edge of the ground by the Churchman brothers, a name which would later become synonymous with the south stand located there. The first permanent stand, a wooden structure known affectionately as the \"Chicken Run\", was built on the Portman Road side of the ground in 1906. This structure was sold in 1971 to the local speedway team, the Ipswich Witches, who installed it at Foxhall Stadium. In 1914, the ground was commandeered by the British Army for use as a training camp for the duration of the First World War. Control of Portman Road was not returned to the club until two years after the end of the war and significant work was required to repair damage to the ground caused by heavy machinery. For a short period during the 1920s, Portman Road was host to a number of whippet races in an attempt to increase revenue, and in 1928 a small stand was built on the west side of the ground. The football club turned professional in 1936 and the cricket club were forced to move out, so work began on the first bank of terracing at the north end of the pitch. The following year, on the back of winning the Southern League, a similar terrace was built at the southern \"Churchmans\" end and 650 tip-up seats, bought from Arsenal, were installed. Portman Road was home to Ipswich Town's first Football League match on 27 August 1938, a 4\u20132 victory against Southend United in Division Three (South) witnessed by more than 19,000 spectators. The Supporters' Association funded a number of improvements at Portman Road; in 1952, concrete terracing replaced the wooden terraces at the cost of \u00a33,000 and another \u00a33,000 was used to re-terrace the North Stand in 1954, bringing the capacity of the ground to approximately 29,000. In 1957, the association raised \u00a330,500 towards the building of a new West Stand, increasing ground capacity to around 31,000. Floodlights were installed two years later; the result of \u00a315,000 raised by the association.","h_score":1706384.4187500002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":1338681,"revid":1170521462,"description":"Stadium for Ipswich Town Football Club","categories":["1884 establishments in England","English Football League venues","Football venues in England","Football venues in Suffolk","Ipswich Town F.C.","Premier League venues","Sports venues completed in 1884","Sports venues in Ipswich"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Portman Road: Ipswich's Historic Football Hub\n\nPortman Road serves as the iconic home stadium for Ipswich Town F.C., a venue steeped in over 140 years of football tradition.

Opposite the windows stood the Zodiac Settle, which Burges moved from Buckingham Street. Love is the central decorative scheme to the room, with the ceiling painted with medieval cupids, and the walls covered with mythical lovers. Carved figures from the Roman de la Rose decorate the chimneypiece, which Crook considered \"one of the most glorious that Burges and Nicholls ever produced\". Echoing Crook, Charles Handley-Read wrote, \"Working together, Burges and Nicholls had transposed a poem into sculpture with a delicacy that is very nearly musical. The Roman de la Rose has come to life.\" The dining room is devoted to Geoffrey Chaucer's The House of Fame and the art of story-telling, Crook explaining that \"tall stories are part of the dining room rite\". The hooded chimneypiece, of Devonshire marble, contained a bronze figure above the fireplace representing the Goddess of Fame; its hands and face were made of ivory, with sapphires for eyes. It was later stolen. The tiles on the walls depict fairy stories, including Reynard the Fox, Jack and the Beanstalk and Little Red Riding Hood. The room also shows Burges's innovative use of materials: Handley-Read observed that the Victorians had \"a horror of food smells\" and therefore the room was constructed using materials that did not absorb odours and could be washed. The walls are covered with Devonshire marble, surmounted by glazed picture tiles, while the ceiling is of sheet metal. The ceiling is divided into coffered compartments by square beams and features symbols of the Sun, the planets and the signs of the Zodiac. Burges designed most of the cutlery and plates used in this room, which display his skills as a designer of metalwork, including the claret jug and Cat Cup chosen by Lord and Lady Bute as mementoes from Burges's collection after his death. The panels of the wine cupboard were decorated by Dante Gabriel Rossetti.","h_score":1726256.7437500001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":5743782,"revid":1172088660,"description":"Late-Victorian townhouse in London, England","categories":["Gothic Revival architecture in London","Grade I listed houses in London","Houses completed in 1881","Houses in Holland Park","William Burges buildings"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is The Tower House?  \nA1: The Tower House is a historic building, likely a fortified residence.

The interest in the film is attributed to a combination of the film's catchy soundtrack as well as its story of cross-generational connections between parents and children. The newfound interest led to waves of new merchandise based on the film to be sold at major retailers. On August 14, 2015, a 20th-anniversary reunion for the film was held at the D23 Expo at Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California. Those in attendance included Bill Farmer, Jason Marsden, Jim Cummings, Rob Paulsen, Jenna von O\u00ff and producer Don Hahn. Wallace Shawn, Pauly Shore and director Kevin Lima also sent video messages. The panel also included musical performances from Farmer, Marsden, and Tevin Campbell. While the panel was not expected to be one of the largest panels at D23, it ended up with the largest attended, with around 1,000 fans attending, and forcing the expo to turn away some due to lack of seating. In the video game Disney Magic Kingdoms, Pete, who appears as a character, makes some references to the film, wearing the same clothes and owning the same recreational vehicle with which he goes camping. In 2016, Campbell uploaded a video of him partaking in a jam session with the band Enfield, in which he performed both \"I 2 I\" and \"Stand Out\". In June 2018, a one-week event titled \"Disney FanDaze\" was opened in Disneyland Paris, featuring several dedicated performances paying tribute to Disney franchises. Among these was \"Max Live! Gettin' Goofy With It\", which featured Max Goof performing songs from A Goofy Movie. In April 2019, singer Uch\u00e9 performed \"I 2 I\" during the Top 10 Disney Night of American Idol's seventeenth season. According to co-producer Frank Angones, the film was a strong influence during early development of the 2017 DuckTales series, particularly on its version of Donald Duck, as the creators \"wanted [the] show to do for Donald what Goofy Movie did for Goofy\". The series itself featured several references to the film, including the appearances of the song \"Stand Out\", Lester's Possum Park, and pictures of Goofy, Max, and Roxanne. In October 2021, Cody Rigsby and Cheryl Burke danced a Jive to \"Stand Out\" during night one of Disney Week on the 30th season of Dancing with the Stars. During an interview with i-D for Paul Thomas Anderson's film Licorice Pizza, lead actress Alana Haim called A Goofy Movie her favorite movie of all time, stating \"If you haven't seen it, you need to watch A Goofy Movie.

However, Henry the Young King challenged the election, on the grounds of illegitimacy and an uncanonical election. Reginald went to Rome in the company of Richard of Dover, who had just been elected Archbishop of Canterbury and was facing a challenge from the Young King to his election. Reginald was confirmed by Pope Alexander III on 18 April 1174 with Walter Map alleging bribery as the only reason the election was confirmed. Ralph de Diceto, however, states that Reginald swore an oath that he was uninvolved in the death of Becket and that his birth took place before his father became a priest. During the dispute, Reginald's friend Peter of Blois wrote him a letter, which is still extant, encouraging him to persevere.\n\nAs a bishop, Reginald was kept busy attending the king's councils and the royal court, but also took part in the 1178 mission to Toulouse, led by Cardinal Pierre of San Crisogono, which attempted to deal with the Cathar heretics there. He attended the Third Lateran Council in 1179. During the 1180s, he was more active in the affairs of his diocese, and appears less often in the secular affairs of the kingdom, but in 1189 he took part in the coronation of King Richard I of England. In April 1191 he was one of the persons selected to arbitrate between the chancellor William Longchamp and Prince John of England. He also attended the trial of William Longchamp on 5 October 1191 at Loddon Bridge between Reading and Windsor that dismissed Longchamp from his offices.

Following the 2001 general election, he was again appointed a PPS to the Minister of State at the Home Office Jeff Rooker for a year. He rejoined the Defence Select Committee in 2003. Following the 2005 general election he served as the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee until 2010. Gapes was an officer of many All-party Parliamentary Groups (APPG), including Chair of the All-Party Crossrail Group, Chair of the All-Party Global Security and non Proliferation Group and Chair of the All-Party United Nations Group. He was part of the Northern Ireland team which negotiated the Good Friday Agreement in Belfast in 1998. During the 2001 and 2005 general election campaigns, he was the target of Muslim groups, including (according to the Ilford Recorder) the Association of Ilford Muslims, and Islamic Society of Britain (Ilford Branch), as well as (according to The Jewish Chronicle) the Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK, who he says sought to unseat him because of his pro-Israel views. Gapes is a member of Labour Friends of Israel (LFI). In 2007, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee reported that it was \"unlikely\" any abuse was continuing at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp since 2004, calling the facilities \"broadly comparable\" to HM Prison Belmarsh. Gapes said: \"I thought that we would see detainees in orange overalls kept in cages, but they are now in modern blocks. The images from 2002 were of Camp X-Ray and that is now shut\", adding that an immediate shutdown of Guantanamo Bay would lead to a release of individuals back into society who were \"dangerous\". Andrew Tyrie, chair of the all-party group on extraordinary rendition said the report was a \"deep disappointment\" and did not acknowledge the moral responsibility to British residents in Guantanamo; Clive Stafford Smith, who represented prisoners at the base, said the report was \"full of factual errors\" and based on a \"show tour\" and Kate Allen, director of Amnesty International, called the report \"a missed opportunity\". Also in 2007, Gapes was criticised for claiming \u00a322,110 for a second home despite his constituency being only 39 minutes away from Westminster. Gapes responded to the criticism saying \"It's perfectly allowed\". In 2008, as chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Gapes met with the Dalai Lama and asked his opinion on human rights in Tibet. As head of the committee, he was heavily critical of the nuclear program of Iran, arguing that there was a \"strong possibility\" Iran would develop a nuclear bomb by 2015. Gapes was Chair of the committee until 2010 and continued to be a member of the committee until 2019.","h_score":1726693.3375000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":426646,"revid":1163234627,"description":"British politician (born 1952)","categories":["1952 births","Alumni of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge","Alumni of Middlesex University","British political party founders","Change UK MPs","Labour Co-operative MPs for English constituencies","Labour Friends of Israel","Living people","People educated at Buckhurst Hill County High School","People from Loughton","People from Wanstead","Politics of the London Borough of Redbridge","UK MPs 1992\u20131997","UK MPs 1997\u20132001","UK MPs 2001\u20132005","UK MPs 2005\u20132010","UK MPs 2010\u20132015","UK MPs 2017\u20132019"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Mike Gapes?  \nA1: Mike Gapes is a British politician and former Labour Party MP for Ilford South.\n\nQ2: What party does he belong to?  \nA2: He is affiliated with the Labour Party.\n\nQ3: When was he first elected to Parliament?  \nA3: He was first elected in 1992.\n\nQ4: What key roles has he held?  \nA4: He chaired the Foreign Affairs Select Committee.\n\nQ5: What are his main focuses?  \nA5: He emphasized foreign policy and international relations.\n\nQ6: Has he been involved in major issues?  \nA6: He was active in debates on Brexit and human rights.\n\nQ7: When did he leave Parliament?  \nA7: He retired in 2019 after losing his seat.\n\nQ8: What is his legacy?  \nA8: He is remembered for his work on global affairs and committee leadership."}

Thurstan managed to secure the resurrection of the Diocese of Galloway, or Whithorn, in 1125. It is possible that he compromised with Fergus of Galloway, who was the lord or sub-king of Galloway, in what is now Scotland. In this Thurstan secured another suffragan, and Fergus gained a bishop in his lordship, where previously ecclesiastical matters in his subkingdom had been handled by Scottish bishops. The first bishop was the native Galwegian \u2013 Gilla Aldan. This provoked the wrath of Wimund, Bishop of the Isles, who had previously had jurisdiction over Galloway; but the new bishopric survived, and York had a new suffragan, an important step in the battle between York and Canterbury over the primacy, which was mainly a battle over the prestige of their respective sees. The number of bishops subject to either archbishop was an important factor in the reputation of each. In 1133, Thurstan, who had received papal permission to found an entirely new diocese, consecrated \u00c6thelwold as the first bishop of the new see of Carlisle.\n\nThurstan refused to accept that the new Archbishop of Canterbury, William de Corbeil, was his superior, and did not help with William's consecration. The dispute between the two continued, and both archbishops carried their complaints in person to Rome twice. In 1126, Pope Honorius II ruled in favour of York. The pope based his decision on the fact that Canterbury's supporting documents had been forged.\n\nThurstan supported King Stephen after Henry I's death in 1135, and appeared at Stephen's first court at Easter held at Westminster. Thurstan negotiated a truce at Roxburgh in 1138 between England and Scotland. It was Thurstan who mustered the army which defeated the Scots at the Battle of the Standard on 22 August 1138 near Northallerton, Yorkshire. Thurstan did not take direct part in the battle., but he created the standard that gave the battle its name, by putting a ship's mast in a cart and hanging the banners of Saint Peter of York, Saint John of Beverley, and Saint Wilfrid of Ripon on the mast. The Scots had invaded attempting to aid the Empress Matilda, the daughter of Henry I and Stephen's rival for the throne. On 21 January 1140 Thurstan resigned his see and entered the order of the Cluniacs at Pontefract and he died there on 6 February 1140. He was buried in the church at Pontefract.\n\n","h_score":1747839.2250000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":157987,"revid":1137975507,"description":"12th-century Anglo-Norman Archbishop of York","categories":["1070s births","1140 deaths","12th-century English Roman Catholic archbishops","Anglo-Normans","Archbishops of York","Cluniacs","Henry I of England","People of The Anarchy","William II of England","Year of birth uncertain"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Thurstan?  \nA1: Thurstan was a 12th-century Archbishop of York, a towering church leader in medieval England.\n\nQ2: When did he live?  \nA2: He lived from about 1070 to 1140, amid turbulent times.\n\nQ3: What was his main role?  \nA3: As Archbishop, he guided the church and influenced politics with steady resolve.\n\nQ4: What key events involved him?  \nA4: He led forces in the Battle of the Standard in 1138, a clash of arms.\n\nQ5: How did he impact the church?  \nA5: Thurstan reformed practices and asserted independence, strengthening its foundations.\n\nQ6: What challenges did he face?  \nA6: He navigated conflicts between kings and popes, a delicate balancing act.\n\nQ7: What is his legacy?  \nA7: His efforts shaped English ecclesiastical history, leaving a lasting imprint.\n\nQ8: Why remember him today?  \nA8: Thurstan exemplifies the interplay of faith and power, a vivid medieval tale."}

The supreme god of Lingbao Daoists is known as the Yuanshi Tianzun or the Celestial Worthy of the Original Beginning, who played a similar role to the deified Laozi in the Celestial Masters. According to the scriptures, this god went through a series of kalpa cycles that were given names similar to dynastic names, until emerging at the beginning of the Kaihuang period. The next most important god was Laojun, the deified form of Laozi, who was the Celestial Worthy's chief disciple. Below these two main gods in the celestial hierarchy were those deities associated with the Southern Palace, where spirits went after death to prepare for rebirth. The head of this group of gods was known as the Perfected of the Southern Extremities. Beneath him was the Director of the Equerry, who was in charge of the life records of the spirits, and Lord Han, who controlled Fengdu, the city of the dead. Below these principal gods in the Lingbao hierarchy were other deities such as the Five Old Men, the Dragon Kings, and the Demon Kings.\n\nDeities were present not only in the heavens, but also in the human body itself. They were responsible for maintaining the body's five viscera, guarding the registers of life, and regulating the souls. There were five internal deities that were particularly important in Lingbao Daoism. The Great Unity lived in the head, along with Lordling and White Prime, who could descend into the liver and lungs. The Director of Destinies lived in the heart and sexual organs, and finally, the Peach Child lived in the lower dantian. Normally these deities resided in the heavens, but they could be activated by scriptural recitations to descend into the body.\n\n ## Practices\n\n ### Immortality techniques\n\nDespite a belief in reincarnation, the Lingbao School maintained the traditional Daoist idea that certain techniques could allow an adherent to achieve immortality. One technique was to ingest the essence of the sun and the moon. Practitioners would expose themselves to the celestial bodies at certain times of the month. Closing their eyes, they would visualize that the essences would solidify and enter their bodies. Once in the body, the sun's essence was matched to the heart and visualized as red, while the moon's was matched with the kidneys and seen as black. Besides interior meditation practices, immortality could be achieved through the ingestion of potions or talismans.\n\n ### Rituals\n\nEarly Lingbao ritual was mostly done on an individual basis, either in a meditation chamber, or the courtyard of a house. Early practitioners were not professional priests, but rather 'students of the Dao'. Later on, as the Lingbao movement developed religious institutions and an established clergy, ritual practice became more of a communal rite.\n\nLingbao ritual shares a great deal with ritual in other Daoist traditions. Like other traditions, Lingbao rituals had a theatrical quality that involved accompanying music, dances, and chants. Lingbao Daoism also shared the multidimensional aspect of Daoist ritual, meaning that it was carried on at several different levels simultaneously. For example, while a ritual was being performed, the priest would repeat the ritual within himself through interior meditation.\n\nThere are three categories of ritual in Lingbao Daoism. The first is known as the heavenly Golden Register of Rituals, and is carried out to prevent natural disasters. During the Tang dynasty, this ritual was carried out in honour of the imperial family, but later it could be performed by anyone. The earthly Yellow Register ritual was performed to ensure the dead was at rest. The final type of ritual, which has not survived, was the human Jade Register, which was performed to ensure the salvation of mankind. Of the rituals that have survived, the Golden Register has assumed the role of the Jade register, ensuring salvation and preventing bad weather.\n\n","h_score":1727544.28125,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":2530681,"revid":1141404415,"description":"Daoist school","categories":["Taoist schools"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Lingbao School: Blending Ancient Wisdom with Modern Learning\n\nLingbao School, based in China, is an educational institution rooted in Taoist traditions that emphasizes holistic development.

Brennan Carly from Spin said the song \"highlights [Gaga]'s evocative voice\" and is similar in tone to \"Speechless\" and \"Gypsy\". While reviewing the documentary, Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter said that the song provided \"an extra jolt of poignancy\" in the film. Lauren Valenti from Marie Claire described the track as \"robust and orchestral\", adding that the lyrics \"command attention\". She complimented the decision to have Gaga sing the track, given her connection to sexual abuse. Bradley Stern from MuuMuse also compared it to \"Dope\" and \"Speechless\", while comparing the string arrangement to the music of Lana Del Rey. Stern described it as a \"massive production\" complimenting the lyrics by being straightforward. For Manohla Dargis of The New York Times, Dick was able to successfully change the sombre mood of the documentary with the inclusion of the song. Spencer Kornhaber from The Atlantic praised the song and Gaga's vocals, saying that: \"Even with such somber subject matter, [the singer's] booming delivery and dramatic phrasing will probably remind people of the time when [Gaga's 2009 single] 'Bad Romance' ruled the radio.\"\n\nDeclaring the song Gaga's \"most stirring\" release, Michelle Geslani from Consequence of Sound called the track: \"a sweeping and intensely powerful number \u2014 it's not just any ordinary pop song\".

But far more than that, it is a rally cry for a movement.\" Lisa Wright wrote in NME that the song is: \"a somber piano ballad befitting of the topic with lyrics that depict the frustration of being told to pick yourself up and carry on by people who couldn't possibly understand your situation.\" Idolator's Robbie Daw claimed that the \"powerful, unsettling\" visuals were complemented by a \"strong vocal performance\" from Gaga. Brittany Spanos from Rolling Stone called it an \"evocative track\", which highlighted Gaga's vocals and believed it to be \"a perfect follow-up to [Gaga's Cheek to Cheek album] with Tony Bennett\".

Archaeoindris was one of the largest primates to ever evolve, and was the largest-known strepsirrhine primate, weighing an estimated 160 kg (350 lb). It was roughly the size of an adult male gorilla, which was first noted by Lamberton. Since its discovery, size estimates have varied from \"larger than a human\" to \"possibly the largest primate ever\". In a study by Jungers from 1990, the area of its molar teeth predicted a mass of 230.5 kg (508 lb), while the femoral head diameter predicted a mass of 244.1 kg (538 lb). In 1995, Laurie Godfrey estimated a mass of 197.5 kg (435 lb) using the midshaft circumferences of the humerus and femur. Based on multiple regressions of the cortical area of the femur in 2008, Jungers and colleagues generated the current best estimate of 161.2 kg (355 lb) with a possible range of 150\u2013187.8 kg (331\u2013414 lb). These estimates were considered to be more accurate since the harder cortical bone in the midshaft of the femur supported an animal's weight, and its thickness better correlated with the animal's mass than the midshaft diameter (which includes both hard cortex and spongy bone). The only fossil primate that was probably larger than Archaeoindris was Gigantopithecus blacki, a close relative of orangutans. Like all three species of Palaeopropithecus, Archaeoindris exhibited derived traits not seen in the two other less specialized genera of sloth lemur. These traits included deflated auditory bullae and paired protrusions of bone around the nasal opening consisting of part of the premaxilla and the nasal bones. Its skull was wider than that of Megaladapis, but shorter, measuring 269 millimeters (10.6 inches). Its face was shorter than that of Palaeopropithecus, with its eyes directed further forward. The neurocranium (braincase) was small and elevated relative to the face, unlike Palaeopropithecus. Postorbital constriction (narrowing of the skull behind the eye sockets) is pronounced. The skull also bore a low, broad sagittal crest (a ridge of bone on the top of the skull to which jaw muscles attach) and robust but smaller nuchal crests (ridges of bone on the back of the skull to which neck muscles attach). Unlike Palaeopropithecus the rims of the orbits (eye sockets) were not as thick. The area of the orbit was 946 mm<sup>2<\/sup> (1.466 sq in), comparable to that of gorillas. Based on the ratio of its orbit area to the size of its optic canal, Archaeoindris had low retinal summation, meaning its eyes were less sensitive to light (like living diurnal lemurs).","h_score":1694946.2250000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":2456129,"revid":1139746022,"description":"Extinct giant lemur","categories":["Endemic fauna of Madagascar","Extinct animals of Madagascar","Fossil taxa described in 1909","Holocene extinctions","Lemur genera","Prehistoric animals of Madagascar","Prehistoric monotypic mammal genera","Prehistoric primate genera","Quaternary mammals of Africa","Subfossil lemurs"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What exactly is Archaeoindris?  \nA1: Archaeoindris was a massive extinct lemur from Madagascar, like a furry giant swinging through ancient jungles.  \n\nQ2: How big did it get?  \nA2: It towered over modern lemurs, weighing up to 200 kilograms, evoking shadowy behemoths in misty forests.  \n\nQ3: Where did it live?  \nA3: In Madagascar's lush, prehistoric rainforests, it lurked among towering trees and hidden grottos.  \n\nQ4: When did it exist?  \nA4: From about 2 million years ago until roughly 2,000 years back, a vanished era of wild wonders.  \n\nQ5: Why did it vanish?  \nA5: Human arrival and habitat loss likely sealed its fate, turning vibrant realms into silent echoes.  \n\nQ6: How does it relate to today's lemurs?  \nA6: As a colossal cousin, it shares lemur lineage but dwarfs them, like a mythical ancestor in the family tree.  \n\nQ7: What makes it scientifically special?  \nA7: Its fossils reveal evolutionary giants, offering clues to ancient ecosystems and biodiversity's fragile dance.  \n\nQ8: Why study it today?  \nA8: Archaeoindris sparks insights into extinction's lessons, urging us to protect modern wildlife from similar shadowy ends."}

The French Revolution a year earlier had torn the Whig party in half, with Coke and Fox in the isolated minority who supported the revolutionaries as their acts became more brutal. With the declaration of war in 1793, an impact was finally felt in Britain with a rise in agricultural prices and rent. It also led to the establishment of local yeomanry forces to defend the country, something Coke opposed. This reduced his popularity in Norfolk and led to suspicions he might be a Jacobin, to the point where he was forced to publicly declare that he was not a Republican and \"detested their principles\". Eventually, in late September 1798, he raised the Holkham Yeoman Cavalry, commanding it as a Major, to defend against any invasion. This unit was dissolved in 1802 with the Peace of Amiens, but after war broke out again a year later more volunteer regiments were formed. Coke was notably absent from any preparations for defence, feeling that the risks of invasion were exaggerated, but was eventually persuaded by public opinion to reform the Yeoman Cavalry in 1803; it was again dissolved in 1805. The French Revolution had split the Whigs into two factions, but as it progressed Fox's group in support of the revolutionaries began to dwindle. Coke stuck by Fox, and with the outbreak of the War, the split became finalised; Fox refused to accept that Britain need be involved in the conflict, as did Coke. In Parliament, Coke spoke out against the conflict, debating the motion to raise money for the war through a new tax in April 1794, and supporting Wilberforce's anti-war motion on 24 March 1795. He felt more comfortable with local matters, however, and his main concerns \"were those of the agricultural interest\", arguing against a new land tax and introducing a bill to shorten the shooting season, allowing for the production of more corn. Coke was again returned to Parliament in 1796, despite an anti-war and anti-government address to the electorate which was condemned as arrogant and dictatorial, but found on his return that the Foxites had agreed to withdraw from Parliamentary activity. After Parliament was dissolved in June 1802, another election saw Coke again returned, although in a contested election that cost the candidates \u00a335,000. With the death of William Pitt in 1806, the two Whig groups agreed to an alliance, which took the form of the Ministry of All the Talents; Fox was confirmed as Foreign Secretary, and Windham as Secretary for War and the Colonies. The government apparently offered Coke a peerage, which he refused, and primarily focused on the abolition of slavery, which was accomplished only after the death of Fox on 13 September 1806. Fox's death made Parliament lose some of its appeal to Coke, as they had been close friends. His attendance in the next two years was very limited, and the next occasion of note was his support of the Corn Laws, which were highly unpopular in Norfolk and led to him being physically attacked by a mob in 1815.","h_score":1703117.0,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":1009538,"revid":1161029116,"description":"British politician (1754\u20131842)","categories":["1754 births","1842 deaths","18th-century English farmers","19th-century English farmers","British MPs 1774\u20131780","British MPs 1780\u20131784","British MPs 1790\u20131796","British MPs 1796\u20131800","British landlords","British reformers","Coke family","Earls of Leicester (1837 creation)","English agriculturalists","Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for Norfolk","Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Derby","Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Norfolk","Peers of the United Kingdom created by Queen Victoria","People educated at Eton College","People from Holkham","People from Longford, Derbyshire","UK MPs 1801\u20131802","UK MPs 1802\u20131806","UK MPs 1806\u20131807","UK MPs 1807\u20131812","UK MPs 1812\u20131818","UK MPs 1818\u20131820","UK MPs 1820\u20131826","UK MPs 1826\u20131830","UK MPs 1830\u20131831","UK MPs 1831\u20131832","UK MPs who were granted peerages"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (seventh creation)?  \nA1: Thomas Coke was a British nobleman and agricultural innovator, titled the 1st Earl of Leicester in 1837's seventh creation, blending aristocratic flair with practical farming genius.\n\nQ2: When and where was he born?  \nA2: Born on May 17, 1754, in Norfolk, England, Coke emerged from a landed family, setting the stage for his influential life.\n\nQ3: What was his primary title and role?  \nA3: As the 1st Earl of Leicester, he wielded political sway in Parliament, his title symbolizing wealth and reformist spirit.\n\nQ4: How did he impact agriculture?  \nA4: Coke revolutionized farming with crop rotations and enclosures, earning \"Coke of Norfolk\" fame, boosting yields like a green wave.\n\nQ5: What about his estates?  \nA5: He managed grand Holkham Hall, transforming it into a model estate with lush gardens and innovative designs.\n\nQ6: Did he engage in politics?  \nA6: As a Whig MP, he championed land reforms, weaving threads of progress into Britain's evolving social fabric.\n\nQ7: What personal traits defined him?  \nA7: Known for his energetic curiosity and philanthropy, Coke balanced estate duties with a passion for art and science.\n\nQ8: What is his lasting legacy?  \nA8: His agricultural advancements still inspire modern farming, while his collections preserve a vivid slice of history."}

These poems were often of a rustic or pastoral subject matter and contained refrains. Prior to the nineteenth century, the term would have simply meant country song, with no particular form implied \u2014 a meaning it retains in the vocabulary of early music. According to Julie Kane, the refrain in each stanza indicates that the form descended from a \"choral dance song\" wherein a vocal soloist \u2014 frequently female \u2014 semi-improvised the \"unique\" lyrics of each stanza, while a ring of dancers\u2014all female, or male and female mixed\u2014chimed in with the repetitive words of the refrain as they danced around her in a circle.\" The fixed-form villanelle, containing the nineteen-line dual-refrain, derives from Jean Passerat's poem \"Villanelle (J'ay perdu ma Tourterelle)\", published in 1606. The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics (1993) suggests that this became the standard \"villanelle\" when prosodists such as C\u00e9sar-Pierre Richelet based their definitions of the form on that poem. This conclusion is refuted by Kane, however, who argues that it was instead Pierre-Charles Berthelin's additions to Richelet's Dictionnaire de rimes that first fixed the form, followed a century later by the poet Th\u00e9odore de Banville; his creation of a parody to Passerat's \"J'ay perdu ...\" would lead Wilhelm T\u00e9nint and others to think that the villanelle was an antique form. Despite its classification and origin as a French poetic form, by far the majority of villanelles have been written in English. Subsequent to the publication of Th\u00e9odore de Banville's treatise on prosody \"Petit trait\u00e9 de po\u00e9sie fran\u00e7aise\" (1872), the form became popularised in England through Edmund Gosse and Austin Dobson. Gosse, Dobson, Oscar Wilde, Andrew Lang, and John Payne were among the first English practitioners\u2014theirs and other works were published in Gleeson White's Ballades and Rondeaus, Chants Royal, Sestinas, Villanelles, &c. Selected (1887), which contained 32 English-language villanelles composed by 19 poets. Most modernists disdained the villanelle, which became associated with the overwrought formal aestheticism of the 1890s, i.e., the decadent movement in England. In his 1914 novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, James Joyce includes a villanelle written by his protagonist Stephen Dedalus. William Empson revived the villanelle more seriously in the 1930s, and his contemporaries and friends W. H. Auden and Dylan Thomas also picked up the form. Dylan Thomas's \"Do not go gentle into that good night\" is perhaps the most renowned villanelle of all. Theodore Roethke and Sylvia Plath wrote villanelles in the 1950s and 1960s, and Elizabeth Bishop wrote a particularly famous and influential villanelle, \"One Art,\" in 1976. The villanelle reached an unprecedented level of popularity in the 1980s and 1990s with the rise of the New Formalism. Since then, many contemporary poets have written villanelles, and they have often varied the form in innovative ways; in their anthology of villanelles (Villanelles), Annie Finch and Marie-Elizabeth Mali devote a section entitled \"Variations on the Villanelle\" to such innovations. ## Form\n\nThe villanelle consists of five stanzas of three lines (tercets) followed by a single stanza of four lines (a quatrain) for a total of nineteen lines. It is structured by two repeating rhymes and two refrains: the first line of the first stanza serves as the last line of the second and fourth stanzas, and the third line of the first stanza serves as the last line of the third and fifth stanzas. The rhyme-and-refrain pattern of the villanelle can be schematized as A<sup>1<\/sup>bA<sup>2<\/sup> abA<sup>1<\/sup> abA<sup>2<\/sup> abA<sup>1<\/sup> abA<sup>2<\/sup> abA<sup>1<\/sup>A<sup>2<\/sup>. Here, \"a\" and \"A\" lines rhyme, and A<sup>1<\/sup> and A<sup>2<\/sup> indicate two different refrains which are repeated exactly.\n\nThe villanelle has no established meter, although most 19th-century villanelles used trimeter or tetrameter and most 20th-century villanelles used pentameter. Slight alteration of the refrain line is permissible.\n\n","h_score":1744619.8500000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":32683,"revid":1170047527,"description":"Fixed verse form; nineteen-line poetic form consisting of five tercets followed by a quatrain","categories":["French poetry","Poetic forms","Rhyme","Stanzaic form"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's a villanelle?  \nA1: A villanelle is a poetic dance of 19 lines, swirling with repetition and rhythm.\n\nQ2: How's its structure?  \nA2: Five tercets plus a final quatrain, like steps in a intricate ballet.\n\nQ3: What's the rhyme scheme?  \nA3: ABA repeats relentlessly, echoing like a stubborn echo in a canyon.\n\nQ4: Why the repetition?  \nA4: It builds tension, looping ideas to haunt the reader with vivid persistence.\n\nQ5: Any famous examples?  \nA5: Dylan Thomas's \"Do not go gentle\" shines, a fiery protest against fading.\n\nQ6: How does it evoke emotion?  \nA6: Through echoing lines, it stirs deep feelings, like waves crashing in a storm.\n\nQ7: Tips for writing one?  \nA7: Start with strong refrains, then weave rhymes playfully but precisely.\n\nQ8: Is it still used today?  \nA8: Yes, modern poets twist it for fresh angst, keeping its wild charm alive."}

The Djinguereber Mosque of Timbuktu, Mali, was first built at the start of the 14th century AD (8th century AH) from round mud bricks and a stone-mud mixture, and was rebuilt several times afterwards, steadily growing in size. Further south in Mali, the Great Mosque of Djenn\u00e9, a dramatic example of Sahel mudbrick architecture. was built in 1907, based on the design of an earlier Great Mosque first built on the site in 1280.

By the time a temporary roof was installed in 1903 the adobe building had been standing empty and unmaintained for hundreds of years.\n\nHuaca de la Luna in what is now northern Peru is a large adobe temple built by the Moche people.

A toulou might house up to 80 families. Smaller interior buildings are often enclosed by these huge peripheral walls which can contain halls, storehouses, wells and living areas. The structure resembles a small fortified city. The walls are formed by compacting earth mixed with stone, bamboo, wood and other readily available materials, and are to 6 feet (1.8 m) thick.

In the previous eight weeks they had participated in the German Operation Berlin against Allied shipping in the Atlantic Ocean. The heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen also sought refuge in the harbour on 1 June 1941, after the failed Operation Rhein\u00fcbung (Operation Rhine Exercise). Whilst in port, the ships were in easy range of British air power and suffered frequent attacks and some damage. A ten-month offensive by the RAF from 29 March 1941 comprised 2,928 sorties against the Brest harbour and 171 in daylight. A raid on 24 July lost 12 percent of its strength. Night bombing was safer as the Germans lacked night-fighters and the 18 losses to enemy action were claimed by anti-aircraft guns. During their campaign the RAF used more sophisticated navigation aids; on the night of the 7\/8 December 1941 the Oboe navigation aid was employed for the first time.\n\nConcerned after the loss of Bismarck, Adolf Hitler ordered the Kriegsmarine to move the ships to Germany for overhauls in preparation for their deployment to Norway. There they were to serve as a fleet in being and as the premier naval defence for German-occupied Norway. After lengthy discussions the Oberkommando der Marine opted for the shorter but arguably more dangerous route, through the English Channel.\n\nOn 12 January 1942 Hitler met with the commanders of the operation at his Headquarters in East Prussia (the Wolf's Lair).

During the course of the meeting Hitler likened the German fleet to \"a patient with cancer which is doomed unless they submit to an operation. An operation, on the other hand, even though it may have to be drastic, will at least offer some hope that the patient's life may yet be saved. The passage of our ships is such an operation. It must be attempted\". Not much operational detail was discussed. The Luftwaffe was ordered to provide air cover and diversion raids against British targets.

The theater was the first of its kind to feature newsreels with sound (although the first sound newsreel had been created in 1927 at the Sam H. Harris Theatre), and it was the first exclusive newsreel theater in the U.S. The Embassy incurred a relatively high cost of \\$500 per week for one reel, a price no one was willing to pay. The first newsreel was screened on November 2, 1929, with footage of news items such as the city's 1929 mayoral election debates and the Wall Street Crash. There was a ticket price of 25 cents () for an hour-long show. Screenings took place every hour from 10 a.m. to midnight. As part of an opening-week promotion, the Embassy distributed tickets to thousands of residents. The renamed Embassy Newsreel Theatre saw six or seven thousand visitors per day in its first two weeks as a newsreel theater. The newsreels were completely changed every week, and the theater was on the heavily traveled Times Square, adding to the Embassy's popularity. By 1930, Movietone's editor E. L. Harvey said the Embassy had \"far outgrown its original plans\" of being \"a show window on Broadway for Fox News\". The Embassy's newsreels included the first sound reel of a whale being captured; a tribute to U.S. president Calvin Coolidge; the rise of Adolf Hitler; appearances by Pope Pius XI and J. P. Morgan Jr. and the trial and sentencing of several men who kidnapped oil magnate Charles F. Urschel. Fox Movietone published advertisements saying, \"The Embassy Newsreel grossed more than \\$11,000 in a 550-seat house showing only Fox Movietone News.\" The Embassy Theatre's lease expired in January 1934, and the theater was dark for several weeks because of conflicts over the lease. In early February 1934, the Bethlehem Engineering Corporation leased the theater to Newsreel Theatres Inc., managed by Francis C. Wood Jr. Newsreel Theatres Inc. announced plans to reopen the Embassy for newsreel use, and the theater reopened on February 12, 1934, as the Embassy Path\u00e9 News Theatre, showing newsreels from Path\u00e9 News. The theater had 9,000 visitors in the first four days after it reopened. Among the newsreel stories shown at the Embassy under Path\u00e9 News' operation were Bruno Richard Hauptmann's trial in 1935, as well as a 1938 film on the Nazi Party. William French Githens, who helped run Newsreel Theatres Inc. with Francis Carter Wood Jr., recalled that U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt was \"the greatest single attraction\", with patrons flocking by the hundreds to watch Roosevelt's fireside chats. The Embassy Newsreel continued into the 1940s despite the growing popularity of the television. The Embassy Newsreel Theatre grew into a chain with locations on 50th and 72nd Street as well as the original theater on Times Square. As a whole, the newsreel industry was impacted negatively by World War II, when studios began sharing footage with each other to reduce costs, which consequently resulted in a decrease in competition between newsreel studios (and thus less content). Furthermore, there was growing criticism of the newsreels' tendencies to dramatize factual events, as well as the fact that newsreels discussed stories in a decreasing order of importance. In November 1949, it was announced that the Embassy would revert to showing feature films. Githens said he had decided to return the Embassy to cinematic use specifically because newsreels could no longer compete with television.","h_score":1698360.3187500001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":69674876,"revid":1165564304,"description":"Former movie theater in Manhattan, New York","categories":["1925 establishments in New York City","Broadway (Manhattan)","Commercial buildings in Manhattan","Former cinemas in the United States","New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan","New York City interior landmarks","Theater District, Manhattan","Theatres completed in 1925","Thomas W.

Through this area moved supplies, men and materiel between the New England states and those further south, something that became vitally important when the British largely abandoned New England as an objective of military control later in the war. In June 1777, General John Burgoyne began an attempt to gain control of this key area by moving south from the British province of Quebec. After his early success at Ticonderoga, his campaign become bogged down in logistical difficulties, not reaching Saratoga, New York, until mid-September. Burgoyne held expectations that his campaign would be supported by military forces based in New York City under the command of General William Howe and that the forces would meet at Albany, about 40 miles (64 km) south of Saratoga.\n\nApparently as a result of poor communications with Lord Germain, Britain's Secretary of State for the Colonies and the political official in charge of the conflict, General Howe decided instead to attempt the capture of Philadelphia and sailed south with much of his army in July, leaving Sir Henry Clinton in command at New York. Howe's instructions to General Clinton were primarily to hold New York City and to only engage in offensive operations that were consistent with that goal. His instructions to Clinton on July 30 included a promise that reinforcements would arrive (but without any promised time) and that Clinton should consider making a move \"in favor of General Burgoyne's approaching Albany, with security to Kingsbridge\" if the opportunity presented itself. A letter from Howe reached Burgoyne on August 3 informing him of his move to Philadelphia and of Clinton's instructions. Clinton wrote a letter on September 12 (received by Burgoyne on September 21, after the Battle of Freeman's Farm) that he would \"make a push at [Fort] Montgomery in about ten days\" if \"you think 2000 men can assist you effectually\".\n\n ## Prelude\n\n ### Forces\n\nForces involved in the battle were:\n\n- British forces\n  - (detachment) 17th Regiment of (Light) Dragoons\n  - 7th Regiment of Foot (Royal Fusiliers)\n  - 17th Regiment of Foot\n  - 26th Regiment of Foot\n  - 52nd Regiment of Foot\n  - 57th Regiment of Foot\n  - 63rd Regiment of Foot\n  - Company, 1st Battalion, 71st Regiment of Foot\n- German forces\n  - Grenadier Company, 1st Anspach-Beyreuth Regiment\n  - Regiment von Trumbach (Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel)\n- Colonial forces\n  - Loyal American Regiment\n  - Emmerich's Chasseurs\n  - New York Volunteers\n  - King's American Regiment\n  - King's Orange Rangers\n\n ### American defenses\n\nThe highland region of the Hudson River valley (near West Point) was defended by Continental Army troops and state militia under the command of Major General Israel Putnam, who was based at Peekskill. Several miles upriver from Peekskill, just above the Popolopen Gorge where Popolopen Creek enters the Hudson, the Americans had placed a chain across the Hudson to prevent British naval vessels from sailing further upriver. The chain's western end was guarded by Fort Montgomery (named for the late General Richard Montgomery), which also overlooked the gorge to the south. Also on the west side of the river, south of the gorge, they had established Fort Clinton (probably named for General James Clinton). Fort Montgomery, which was still undergoing construction, was under the command of General (and Governor of New York) George Clinton, while Fort Clinton was under the command of his older brother James. Their combined forces numbered about 600.\n\nThe primary camp at Peekskill, which any British naval movements would need to pass, had roughly 600 men. Of the men at the three sites, about 1,000 were regular troops, while the remainder were short-term New York militia. Putnam's forces had originally been larger, but General George Washington had ordered some of Putnam's troops to assist either his (Washington's) defense against Howe or Gates' defense against Burgoyne, and a number of local militia companies had been dismissed when Howe's movements became known. Putnam received word of the arrival of transports in New York on September 29 and wrote Governor Clinton for assistance, who immediately came south from Kingston to take charge of the forts.\n\n","h_score":1702909.2625000002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":15905884,"revid":1161590382,"description":"Battle of the American Revolutionary War","categories":["1777 in New York (state)","1777 in the United States","Battles involving Great Britain","Battles involving the United States","Battles of the American Revolutionary War in New York (state)","Battles of the Saratoga campaign","Conflicts in 1777","History of Orange County, New York"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### British Forces Seize Key Hudson Forts\n\nIn 1777, during the American Revolutionary War, British troops under Sir Henry Clinton overwhelmed Forts Clinton and Montgomery in New York, securing control of the Hudson River and isolating New England colonies.\n\n**Background of the Conflict**  \nThe forts guarded vital river routes, drawing British attention amid escalating tensions.\n\n**The Intense Battle**  \nAmerican defenders fought valiantly but were outnumbered, as \"We held as long as we could,\" noted General George Clinton.\n\n**Aftermath and Losses**  \nThe defeat exposed colonial weaknesses, with British General Henry Clinton declaring, \"Victory here eases our northern pressures.\"\n\nThis event highlighted the war's fluid dynamics, shaping future American strategies."}

Naturally, so was Mulan's characterization and role in the film. The writers wanted Mulan to represent a \"different kind of Disney heroine,\" specifically described as one who \"didn't need a tiara, but was still just as much as graceful, strong, and courageous.\" Between the two, Bancroft and his twin brother Tom, an animator who also worked on Mulan, have a total of seven daughters. This further inspired the filmmakers to portray Mulan as a unique heroine who is \"not another damsel in distress\" in favor of having her resemble \"a strong female Disney character who would truly be the heroine of her own story\" instead, essentially a \"female role model. The characteristics of strength and courage were a must for Mulan.\" In an interview with The Christian Post, Bancroft elaborated on the way in which he, as the film's director, continued to consider the well-being of his two young daughters while working on Mulan, having \"wanted to make a unique heroine that hadn't been seen before\" and provide for them \"someone who would be strong on her own, without a prince saving her.\" Addressing the way in which Mulan differs from traditional Disney heroines and princesses, Bancroft explained, \"Most Disney heroines have an outside source that comes in and helps them change. Mulan stays consistent. From the first frame all the way through the end of the movie, her personality, her drive it all stays the same.\" Visually, the animators were influenced by both traditional Chinese and Japanese artwork. In the specific case of Mulan, \"The characters' simple lines ... resemble classic Asian painting\". Chinese artist Chen Yi mentored the animators, \"helping [them] to come up with these designs.\" Mark Henn served as Mulan's supervising animator. Animating the character in her male disguise as \"Ping\" offered an unprecedented challenge for Henn. In order to solve this unique dilemma, Henn was provided with \"the opportunity to adjust her design a little bit so that when she was disguised as Ping, as a soldier, that she was physically a little different in how we drew her than when she was herself as Mulan.\" Physically, Mulan was also designed to appear less feminine than preceding traditional Disney animated heroines, specifically Pocahontas from Pocahontas (1995) and Esmeralda from The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), because \"you can't pass as a man in the army with a Barbie-style figure.\" Henn revealed that he was drawn to \"Mulan's story [because it] was so unique and compelling that it just captivated me from the beginning\". Animating the characters' distinct emotions using the traditional Chinese style turned out to be somewhat challenging for Henn. The animator explained, \"We don't create realism in the sense that if you're doing a human character, it's not going to look realistic ... the balance is finding an appealing way of drawing using the visual tools that you have in the design to convey the believable emotions that you want to get across.\" In addition to Mulan, Henn was also responsible for animating Fa Zhou, Mulan's elderly father. He described the complex relationship between the two characters as \"the emotional heart of the story\". Fathering one daughter himself, Henn drew inspiration from his own emotions as well as past personal experiences while animating several intimate scenes shared by the two characters. Several film critics have described Mulan as a tomboy. Andy Patrizio of IGN observed, \"In this slightly modernized version of the story, Mulan is something of a rebel and a tomboy. She has no interest in being a good little subservient wife, despite her sighing parents' wishes.\" Jo Johnson, in contribution to the book Queers in American Popular Culture Volume 1: Film and Television, wrote that \"Unlike other Disney heroines, Mulan is immediately coded as a tomboy,\" observing the way in which the character speaks using a full mouth. Johnson additionally noticed several ways in which Mulan's design and personality differ from those typically associated with traditional Disney heroines and princesses, citing the character's clumsy, awkward demeanor; broad shoulders and muscular limbs; unruly single strand of hair; and choice of everyday attire which usually consists of loose, baggy clothing concealing her \"traditionally slim Disney waist.\" Additionally, Mulan's intelligence has been observed in several professional analyses, with critics often citing the character as \"brainy.\" ## Appearances\n\n ### Films\n\n","h_score":1697583.71875,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":55717,"revid":1173764001,"description":"Character from Disney's 1998 animated film","categories":["Animated characters introduced in 1998","Disney Princess characters","Female characters in animated films","Fictional Han dynasty people","Fictional advisors","Fictional archers","Fictional bojutsuka","Fictional cross-dressers","Fictional farmers","Fictional female martial artists","Fictional female soldiers and warriors","Fictional female swordfighters","Fictional jianke","Fictional swordfighters in films","Fictional tessenjutsuka","Fictional war veterans","Film characters introduced in 1998","Mulan (franchise)","Walt Disney Animation Studios characters"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Disney's Mulan: A Tale of Courage and Identity\n\nMulan is Disney's animated character inspired by a Chinese legend, depicting a young woman who disguises herself as a man to serve in the army.

She died at age 103.\n\n ## Early life and education\n\nJennie Smillie was born on February 10, 1878, on a farm outside of Hensall, Ontario, to Benjamin Smillie (1839\u20131886) and Jane Smillie (n\u00e9e Buchanan; 1849\u20131906) as one of several children. Jennie Smillie attended public schools in Hensall and later in Seaforth. She showed interest in medical science at an early age. As an adult, she told another female doctor and friend, \"I was only 3 when I first thought about being a doctor. I heard of a woman missionary doctor. When I was 5 I asked my mother if women could be doctors. She told me they could and from then on I knew that is what I would do.\"\n\nSmillie was initially educated as a teacher and worked until age 25 to save for tuition for the Ontario Medical College for Women. Before her second year of medical school in 1906, the college merged with the University of Toronto\u2019s medical school, making the school coeducational; some women felt hostility from their male peers, though Smillie felt the women positively influenced the men. She graduated in 1909.\n\n","h_score":1694241.8375000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":7986431,"revid":1143587176,"description":"Canadian female surgeon, 1878\u20131981","categories":["1878 births","1981 deaths","20th-century Canadian physicians","20th-century Canadian women scientists","20th-century surgeons","20th-century women physicians","Canadian centenarians","Canadian gynaecologists","Canadian women physicians","People from Huron County, Ontario","University of Toronto alumni","Women centenarians","Women surgeons"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Trailblazing Surgeon: Jennie Smillie Robertson's Historic Breakthrough\n\nJennie Smillie Robertson made history as Canada's first female surgeon in 1899, defying gender norms in a male-dominated field.

Later in life he worked to memorialize the Trail, repeatedly retracing the trip of his youth. Once known as the \"Hop King of the World\", he was the first mayor of Puyallup, Washington.\n\nMeeker was born in Butler County, Ohio, to Jacob and Phoebe Meeker. His family relocated to Indiana when he was a boy. He married Eliza Jane Sumner in 1851; the following year the couple, with their newborn son and Ezra's brother, set out for the Oregon Territory, where land could be claimed and settled on. Although they endured hardships on the Trail in the journey of nearly six months, the entire party survived the trek. Meeker and his family briefly stayed near Portland, then journeyed north to live in the Puget Sound region. They settled at what is now Puyallup in 1862, where Meeker grew hops for use in brewing beer. By 1887, his business had made him wealthy, and his wife built a large mansion for the family. In 1891, an infestation of hop aphids destroyed his crops and took much of his fortune. He later tried his hand at a number of ventures, and made four largely unsuccessful trips to the Klondike, taking groceries and hoping to profit from the gold rush.\n\nMeeker became convinced that the Oregon Trail was being forgotten, and he determined to bring it publicity so it could be marked and monuments erected. In 1906\u20131908, while in his late 70s, he retraced his steps along the Oregon Trail by wagon, seeking to build monuments in communities along the way. His trek reached New York City, and in Washington, D.C., he met President Theodore Roosevelt. He traveled the Trail again several times in the final two decades of this life, including by oxcart in 1910\u20131912 and by airplane in 1924. During another such trip, in 1928, Meeker fell ill but was succored by Henry Ford. On his return to Washington state, Meeker became ill again and died there on December 3, 1928, at the age of 97. Meeker wrote several books; his work has continued through the activities of such groups as the Oregon-California Trails Association.\n\n ## Early life\n\nEzra Morgan Meeker was born in Butler County, Ohio, near Huntsville, on December 29, 1830, to Jacob (1804\u20131869) and Phoebe Meeker ( Baker; 1801\u20131854). His paternal ancestors had been among the early settlers of Elizabeth, New Jersey, where their ancestral home was located. In the American Revolutionary War, about twenty Meekers fought for the new nation. Ezra was the fourth of the six children Jacob and Phoebe had while together, with older brothers John, Manning (died at age one week) and Oliver, and a younger sister Hannah and brother Clark.\n\nJacob was a miller and farmer. In 1839, the family moved from Ohio to Indiana, close to Indianapolis\u2014Ezra and his older brother Oliver walked behind the family wagon for 200 miles (320 km). Ezra had little formal education; he later estimated a total of six months. Phoebe, seeing that her son's mind was not well adapted to formal learning, allowed him to earn money through odd jobs. He obtained work as printer's devil at the Indianapolis Journal, where his duties involved delivering the newspaper to subscribers, among them local pastor Henry Ward Beecher. In 1845, Phoebe's father, a Cincinnati merchant, gave his daughter \\$1,000, enough to buy the family a farm. As both Jacob and Ezra Meeker realized the boy enjoyed the outdoor life more than inside work, Jacob placed Ezra in charge of the farm, allowing the elder Meeker to work as a miller.\n\n","h_score":1691005.26875,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":1773046,"revid":1117509589,"description":"American pioneer (1830\u20131928)","categories":["1830 births","1928 deaths","American lobbyists","Farmers from Washington (state)","History of Washington (state)","Mayors of places in Washington (state)","Oregon Trail","Oregon pioneers","People from Butler County, Ohio","People from Kalama, Washington","People from Puyallup, Washington","People from Steilacoom, Washington","People of the Klondike Gold Rush","Washington (state) pioneers","Writers from Ohio","Writers from Oregon","Writers from Washington (state)"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Ezra Meeker: Pioneer of the Oregon Trail\n\nEzra Meeker was a bold 19th-century pioneer who crossed the Oregon Trail in 1852, facing rugged wilderness and endless horizons.

Many people traveled thousands of miles to visit Selena's house, boutiques, and the crime scene. Hispanics throughout the United States reportedly mourned the singer as far away as New York City and Los Angeles. By mid-afternoon, police were asked to form a detour as a line of automobiles began backing up traffic from the Quintanillas' house. On the street where Selena had lived, gang graffiti and cacti distinguished the blue-collar community from other subdivisions across America.\n\nA chain-link fence in front of Selena's house became a shrine festooned with mementos as fans from across America left messages to Selena and the Quintanilla family. Most car drivers in Corpus Christi, and those driving cars on Interstate 37 from Mexico, turned their headlights on in her memory. Fans scribbled notes and messages, and placed them on the door and doorstep of the room in which Selena had been shot.\n\nSoon after learning of Selena's death, people began speculating about the identity of her murderer. Some fans thought Emilio Navaira's wife had shot Selena; they believed she was jealous of Selena and Navaira's relationship. Johnny Pasillas, Emilio's brother-in-law and manager, frantically called radio stations in an attempt to quash the rumor. Among the celebrities who believed the rumor were record producer Manny Guerra, Pete Rodriguez, and American singer Ramon Hernandez. According to anchorwoman Arrar\u00e1s, Selena's death became \"the most important news [story] of the year for Latinos\". Texas Monthly editor Pamela Colloff wrote that reactions to her death were equivalent to those following a political assassination. Reactions were compared to those that followed the deaths of John Lennon, Elvis Presley, and John F. Kennedy.\n\nSelena had a \"cult-like\" following among Latinos; after her death she became a household name in the United States and a part of the American pop culture. She was more popular after her death than when she was alive. Selena became a cultural icon for Latinos and was seen as \"a woman who was proud of her roots [who had] achieved her dreams\". According to Antonio Lopez of The Santa Fe New Mexican, the day Selena was killed \"is a bookmark in time in the memories of many Latinos\". According to Arrar\u00e1s, \"women imitated her, men worshiped her\". In the aftermath of Selena's murder, two linked deaths in California were reported. A drag queen planned to dress as Selena for a performance; he was hit by a car and left to die. Actress Gloria de la Cruz auditioned for the role of Selena; her body was later found in a dumpster in Los Angeles. Her killer had strangled her and set her body on fire.\n\n","h_score":1702977.25,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":28326342,"revid":1171928775,"description":"1995 murder in Corpus Christi, Texas, US","categories":["1995 in Latin music","1995 in Texas","1995 in music","1995 murders in the United States","Deaths by person in Texas","Embezzlement","False allegations of sex crimes","Female murder victims","Funerals by person","Hispanic and Latino American-related controversies","History of Corpus Christi, Texas","History of women in Texas","Incidents of violence against women","March 1995 crimes","March 1995 events in the United States","Murder in Texas","Selena","Violence against women in the United States"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Tragic Silencing of a Tejano Icon\n\nSelena Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez, the vibrant queen of Tejano music, was fatally shot in 1995 by her fan club president amid financial disputes.

In Tam's confession, he stated he had been forced to join the shooting and deliberately did not target any patrons; after he \"heard Melvin start shooting, then Peter. I fired my first shot at the sofa. The second I aimed where nobody was.\" Testimony at Melvin Yu's trial showed he was the first to open fire, using the rifle.\n\nMelvin Yu walked directly up to a man at a table and shot him nine times, continuing to shoot after that victim had fallen to the floor. Melvin Yu then redirected his automatic rifle and shot randomly into the crowd, accompanied by two shotgun blasts from the other gunmen. The first victim, later identified as Paul Wada, a visiting law student, may have been misidentified as a gang sympathizer. An initial news report incorrectly identified some shooting victims as \"highly placed\" gang members.\n\nThe intended targets, the leadership of the Wah Ching and Hop Sing, were sitting at a table at the back of the restaurant. They were not injured in the shooting. Up to 10 members of the Wah Ching, including their leader, Michael Louie, ducked under tables during the gunfire. They had been alerted by a friend who spotted the three gunmen running toward the restaurant from a front-facing window and shouted \"Man with a gun!\" in Cantonese and English. Triad member Raymond Kwok Chow, then 17 years old and a member of the allied Hop Sing Tong, who would later achieve considerable notoriety, was among those who survived the attack.\n\nThe shooting lasted less than 60 seconds. Police later called it the worst mass murder in San Francisco history.\n\nComedians Philip Proctor and Peter Bergman of the Firesign Theatre were eating at the Golden Dragon during the shooting, after performing a Proctor and Bergman show at the Great American Music Hall. When Bergman, an Army veteran, realized the perpetrators had emptied their weapons, he rose from cover in time to see their faces as they exited. He later testified in their conviction.\n\nTwo off-duty armed police officers were also dining at the Golden Dragon during the attack. James Bonanno, a restaurant patrolman, dove for cover when the gunmen entered; he later testified that he pulled his revolver and radioed for help while hiding. Once the shooting stopped, after 30 to 45 seconds, he emerged and began to help the wounded diners. Richard Hargens (or Harkins) also fell to the floor after hearing shots and though he drew his revolver, he stated other people were in his line of fire and he was unable to shoot the gunmen. Neither officer was able to identify the gunmen beyond describing them as \"young Orientals\".\n\n ### Cleaning up\n\nChester Yu drove the shooters back to the house in Pacifica after the shooting, and the weapons were returned to the closet. After their return, the Joe Boys stayed awake until dawn discussing the shooting, then slept for a few hours before awakening to listen to the news of the killing. They dispatched Tony Chun-Ho Szeto, another Joe Boy, to pick up noodles from the Golden Dragon for breakfast. Later that morning, the perpetrators retrieved the weapons from the closet, cut them into pieces in the garage, and asked Szeto to dump the pieces into San Francisco Bay. Szeto drove Chester Yu to a location within sight of Kee Joon's, a Burlingame restaurant where Szeto worked, and together they dumped the parts into the Bay near San Francisco International Airport. A week after the shooting, Tom Yu called Carlos Jon for the last time, asking Jon to \"keep cool.\"\n\n ## Victims\n\nThe five victims fatally shot at the restaurant were later identified as:\n\n- Calvin M. Fong (\u65b9\u51f1\u6587), 18, a graduate of Archbishop Riordan High School\n- Donald Kwan (\u541b\u5510\u52de), 20, a graduate of Abraham Lincoln High School\n- Denise Louie (\u96f7\u5178\u79ae), 21, an urban planning student at the University of Washington\n- Paul Wada (\u548c\u7530\u4fdd\u7f85), 25, a law student at the University of San Francisco\n- Fong Wong (\u9ec3\u82b3), 48, an immigrant from Hong Kong working as a server at the Golden Dragon\n\n ## Aftermath\n\nOne week after the shooting, two Joe Boys were shot by suspected Wah Ching gunmen, leaving one dead and the other critically wounded, in what police called a revenge-motivated shooting. Michael Lee, 18, was killed and Lo \"Mark\" Chan, 19, was wounded critically during the ambush at the entryway of Chan's Richmond District home.\n\nChinatown, one of the leading tourist destinations in San Francisco, suffered after the shooting. Nighttime dining in Chinatown was depressed as restaurant reservations were cancelled en masse following the shooting. Although the Golden Dragon reopened just seven hours after the shooting, it closed as early as 10 P.M. in the week following a drop in patronage; normally it would stay open until 3 A.M. Business and tourist traffic remained depressed for several weeks following the shootings, although other businesses stated the rising cost of labor in Chinatown was to blame for increased prices and decreased patronage. By December, business at the Golden Dragon remained down and police had still not made any arrests, although by that time Michael Louie, the reported target that night, had been arrested for his suspected involvement with the 1976 murder of Kit Mun Louie (no relation), an 18-year-old immigrant from Hong Kong.\n\n","h_score":1695836.05,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":2276024,"revid":1173867269,"description":"1977 shooting in San Francisco, California, USA","categories":["1970s crimes in California","1970s trials","1977 in San Francisco","1977 mass shootings in the United States","1977 murders in the United States","20th-century mass murder in the United States","Attacks on buildings and structures in 1977","Attacks on buildings and structures in California","Attacks on restaurants in North America","Chinatown, San Francisco","Chinese restaurants outside China","Chinese-American organized crime events","Mass murder in 1977","Mass murder in California","Mass murder in the United States","Mass shootings in California","Mass shootings in the United States","Massacres in 1977","Massacres in the United States","Murder in the San Francisco Bay Area","Murder trials","Organized crime conflicts in the United States","People murdered by Chinese-American organized crime","September 1977 events in the United States","Triad (organized crime)","Trials in the United States","Violent non-state actor incidents in the United States"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What was the Golden Dragon massacre?  \nA1: It was a notorious gang-related shooting in San Francisco's Chinatown, claiming five lives and wounding 11 others in 1977.\n\nQ2: When and where did it happen?  \nA2: The event unfolded on January 4, 1977, at the Golden Dragon restaurant, a bustling spot in the heart of Chinatown.\n\nQ3: Who was involved?  \nA3: It involved rival Chinese gangs, like the Wah Ching and Joe Boys, in a violent turf war that erupted into chaos.\n\nQ4: What caused the conflict?  \nA4: Deep-rooted rivalries over territory and influence fueled the attack, highlighting tensions in the immigrant community.\n\nQ5: How many were affected?  \nA5: Five people died, and 11 were injured, mostly innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire of gang violence.\n\nQ6: What was the immediate aftermath?  \nA6: Police cracked down on gangs, leading to arrests and trials, while the community rallied for safety reforms.\n\nQ7: How did it impact Chinatown?  \nA7: The massacre sparked fear and unity, prompting cultural shifts toward anti-gang initiatives and community healing.\n\nQ8: What is its lasting significance?  \nA8: It exposed organized crime in Asian-American enclaves, inspiring long-term efforts for peace and social justice echoes today."}

When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of 14,700 meters (16,100 yd); they had a maximum ceiling of 9,440 meters (30,970 ft) at their maximum elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was approximately eight rounds per minute. The ship was equipped with two Type 94 fire-control directors to control the 12.7-centimeter (5.0 in) guns, one for each side of the ship; the starboard-side director was on top of the island and the other director was positioned below flight deck level on the port side.\n\nThe ship's light AA armament consisted of seven triple and five twin-gun mounts for license-built Hotchkiss 25 mm Type 96 AA guns. Two of the triple mounts were sited on a platform just below the forward end of the flight deck. The gun was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it largely ineffective. According to historian Mark Stille, the weapon had many faults including an inability to \"handle high-speed targets because it could not be trained or elevated fast enough by either hand or power, its sights were inadequate for high-speed targets, it possessed excessive vibration and muzzle blast, and its magazines were too small to maintain high rates of fire\". These 25-millimeter (1 in) guns had an effective range of 1,500\u20133,000 meters (1,600\u20133,300 yd), and an effective ceiling of 5,500 meters (18,000 ft) at an elevation of +85 degrees. The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen-round magazines. The Type 96 guns were controlled by five Type 95 directors, two on each side and one in the bow.\n\n ### Armor\n\nHiry\u016b had a waterline belt with a maximum thickness of 150 millimeters (5.9 in) over the magazines that reduced to 90 millimeters (3.5 in) over the machinery spaces and the avgas storage tanks. It was backed by an internal anti-splinter bulkhead. The ship's deck was 25 millimeters (0.98 in) thick over the machinery spaces and 55 millimeters (2.2 in) thick over the magazines and avgas storage tanks.\n\n ## Construction and service\n\nFollowing the Japanese ship-naming conventions for aircraft carriers, Hiry\u016b was named \"Flying Dragon\". The ship was laid down at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 8 July 1936, launched on 16 November 1937 and commissioned on 5 July 1939. She was assigned to the Second Carrier Division on 15 November. In September 1940, the ship's air group was transferred to Hainan Island to support the Japanese invasion of French Indochina. In February 1941, Hiry\u016b supported the blockade of Southern China. Two months later, the 2nd Carrier Division, commanded by Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi, was assigned to the First Air Fleet, or Kido Butai, on 10 April. Hiry\u016b returned to Japan on 7 August and began a short refit that was completed on 15 September. She became flagship of the Second Division from 22 September to 26 October while S\u014dry\u016b was refitting.\n\n","h_score":1743224.03125,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":65567,"revid":1129845233,"description":"Aircraft carrier of the Imperial Japanese Navy","categories":["1937 ships","Aircraft carriers of the Imperial Japanese Navy","Aircraft carriers sunk by aircraft","Attack on Pearl Harbor","Maritime incidents in June 1942","Scuttled vessels","Second Sino-Japanese War naval ships of Japan","Ships built by Yokosuka Naval Arsenal","Ships of the Battle of Midway","Ships sunk by US aircraft","World War II aircraft carriers of Japan","World War II shipwrecks in the Pacific Ocean"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Hiry\u016b: The Dragon of the Skies\n\nThe Japanese aircraft carrier Hiry\u016b was a WWII powerhouse, launching surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor.

The song was co-written by Bowie and Brian Eno and originally recorded during the sessions for Bowie's 1995 album Outside; this version was released on the soundtrack of the 1995 film Showgirls. The song was then remade during the sessions for Earthling with his then-current band, guitarist Reeves Gabrels, pianist Mike Garson, bassist Gail Ann Dorsey and drummer Zack Alford. The remake was recorded between August and October 1996 at Looking Glass Studios in New York City and featured rewritten lyrics, overdubs and transposed verses. An industrial and techno track, it presents a critique of America through the eyes of a stereotypical \"Johnny\" and is characterised by drum patterns, synthesisers, various loops and vocal distortions.\n\nFollowing its release on the album, Virgin Records issued the song as a maxi-single in North America only with six different remixes. The remixes were mostly created by Trent Reznor and his Nine Inch Nails band members, continuing his and Bowie's association following the Outside Tour; the V3 mix featured Ice Cube while the V5 mix was created by Photek. Reznor subsequently appeared in the music video, which reflected the song's theme of a frightened European in an American city. A top 20 hit in Canada, the single peaked at number 66 on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent 16 weeks on the chart. It was the final Bowie single to chart on the Hot 100 until 2015. Reznor's V1 mix has since appeared on several compilation albums.\n\nThe song has received positive responses from critics and biographers. Rolling Stone named it one of the 30 most essential songs of Bowie's catalogue in 2016. Some American commentators later acknowledged the significance of the lyrics in the late 2010s. Bowie performed \"I'm Afraid of Americans\" frequently on his concert tours, from the 1997 Earthling to 2003 A Reality tours. Live performances have been released on numerous live albums.

His brother, Robert Maclay Widney (1838\u20131929), had arrived in Los Angeles in 1868, and was a lawyer, and later judge, as well as the city's first real estate agent. Robert Widney was also the publisher of The Real Estate Advertiser. Joseph Widney invested in real estate in the Los Angeles area, which made him financially independent, and allowed him to retire from the practice of medicine at 55. In 1900, the Los Angeles Times called him \"an extensive property owner in this city\". At one time he owned the Widney Block on First Street, another Widney Block at Sixth and Broadway, and a property at the corner of Ninth and Santee streets, where he erected the Nazarene Methodist Episcopal Church. He also owned a building at 445\u2013447 Aliso Street, where the first college of medicine for the University of Southern California was located from 1885 to 1896. His investment in land started early. Between April 29, 1869, and August 28, 1871, he bought thirty-four lots in Wilmington near the San Pedro harbor area and another 60 acres (240,000 m<sup>2<\/sup>) near the San Gabriel Mission (Rand 28). He owned the parcel of land where the Los Angeles City Hall now stands, as well as much of Mount Washington, Los Angeles, where his last home (a Victorian mansion at 3901 Marmion Way) stood. During the Los Angeles boom in 1885, Widney bought 35,000 acres (142 km<sup>2<\/sup>) of land (75 miles (121 km) northeast of Los Angeles) comprising the relatively undeveloped township of Hesperia, California. Widney formed the Hesperia Land and Water Company to create a town. Horace Bell, in his On the Old West Coast, a personal reflection on that period, critiqued the boomers, as a \"speculative conspiracy against all that was honest.\" No houses were built in \"Widneyville.\" The Los Angeles Times of June 2, 1887 said that Widney had purchased a hotel and several bath houses in the town of Iron-Sulphur Springs, once known as Fulton Wells and now as Santa Fe Springs, fifteen miles (24 km) east of downtown Los Angeles. In 1886 the springs were purchased by the Santa Fe Railroad, which renamed the town after itself. Widney said, \"We may look lovingly back on log cabin days, but the looking back must be done over a multi-lane highway, not along a cow track\". He supported the development of Los Angeles even at the age of 95. In 1937 he wrote \"A Plan for the Development of Los Angeles as a Great World Health Center.\" To develop Los Angeles, Widney proposed roads and tunnels to cross the Sierra Madre Mountains, linking the city and the interior desert. According to Carl Rand, Widney postulated: > The whole future of the city lies within our own hands. Los Angeles Harbor (which ought to have been larger and deeper); the great Desert City which may be; and the Colorado River water system; these are the three factors which will settle the future of the City of Los Angeles. And the time to strike is now! Jaher lists Widney as among those Los Angeles entrepreneurs who were the \"most avid civic boosters ... [who] made sanguine by their triumphs, they expect urban growth to bring further gains ... [who] predicted that the city would become a great metropolis\". Widney envisioned Los Angeles \"developing into the health capital of the world, a heliopolis of holistic health culture\". He was a member of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce from October 1888. His first two books promoted California. In California of the South (1888), described by David Fine as \"one of the earliest booster tracts\" Widney and Walter Lindley wrote: \"The health-seeker who, after suffering in both mind and body, after vainly trying the cold climate of Minnesota and the warm climate of Florida, after visiting Mentone, Cannes, and Nice, after traveling to Cuba and Algiers, and noticing that he is losing ounce upon ounce of flesh, and his cheeks have grown more sunken, his appetite more capricious, his breath more hurried, that his temperature is no longer normal, ... turns with a gleam of hope toward the Occident\" \u2013 by which they meant Southern California.

The royal anthem officially remained in place until the formal declaration of a republic in March 1970, when it was abandoned along with numerous other overt references to the Crown. Republican Rhodesia was without an anthem for over four years before the chosen music was announced on 28 August 1974: the Fourth Movement, commonly called \"Ode to Joy\", from Ludwig van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The fact that the Council of Europe had adopted this tune as the \"Anthem of Europe\" in January 1972 apparently did not perturb the Rhodesian government; John Sutherland and Stephen Fender comment that Rhodesia's choice proved deeply embarrassing for the UK's Labour government, whose leaders now had to respect a melody associated with Rhodesia when attending official European functions. With a tune now in place, the Rhodesian government organised a nationwide competition to write matching lyrics, the winner of which would receive a cash prize of R\\$500 (equal to about US\\$1,000). The Council of Europe, though less than pleased with Rhodesia's selection, did not object to it, reasoning that so long as Rhodesia was using \"Ode to Joy\" in its original form, it could not be subject to reproach as the music was long out of copyright and in the public domain. It did announce, however, that should Rhodesia use the same arrangement as the Council of Europe, then the author of that score, Herbert von Karajan, would have grounds for a plagiarism lawsuit. Such an incident was averted when Rhodesia adopted an original sixteen-bar arrangement by Captain Ken MacDonald, the Rhodesian African Rifles' bandmaster. The anthem's inaugural instrumental performance in Salisbury provoked mixed reactions: some were enthusiastic\u2014including a coloured sergeant musician who proudly told the Rhodesia Herald that \"it's just like 'God Save Our Gracious Queen'\"\u2014but many others were disappointed that the government had not commissioned an original tune. Rhys Lewis, music critic for the Herald, wrote that he was \"stupefied\" by the government's choice, which he said was not only unoriginal, but also so associated with supranational brotherhood that it risked making internationally isolated Rhodesia the subject of ridicule. Phinias Sithole, who headed the African Trade Union Congress (a black Rhodesian trade union federation), commented that he did not believe most of the country's blacks would identify with a song chosen while people of their ethnicity remained largely absent from the government's top levels. The winning lyricist was confirmed on 24 September 1974 to be Mary Bloom, a company director, music critic and poet from Gwelo, who had moved to Rhodesia from South Africa in 1947.

During this time, Aditya wrote several of his own scripts, including one he assumed would be his first film, but eventually became his second, Mohabbatein (2000). For three years, he worked on the story that would become Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge before approaching his father to direct it. Yash did not want to and tried to persuade Aditya to do it himself. As they were discussing ideas for the script, Aditya conceived the notion that Raj would seek permission for marriage from Simran's stern father, rather than eloping with her. He then became excited about the possibility of directing the film himself. After his mother, the playback singer Pamela Chopra, agreed that the idea was sound, he decided to make this his directorial debut. Aditya wanted to make a wholesome film that people could watch repeatedly. He wanted to diverge from the typical plot line of the time, in which lovers run away when their parents object, and show that if their love was strong enough, the parents would eventually understand.\n\nIn May 1994, Aditya read the first draft of the script to several members of the Yash Raj Films production team assigned to work with him, including a cinematographer, an art director, and a dialogue writer. They were not impressed, but Aditya held fast to his ideas. He was given total editorial control by his father, the producer, and made the film according to his own tastes and sensibilities. Aditya struggled with both the dialogue writer Javed Siddiqui and the song lyricist Anand Bakshi to develop words that were \"young-sounding\". There were personal clashes over writing credits on the final script. Pamela's friend Honey Irani believed she deserved a writing credit that she did not receive, and Siddiqui believed Aditya did not deserve partial credit for the dialogue. After Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, neither of them ever worked with Yash Raj Films again. After approving the script, Yash was consulted about the songs, but mostly left the creative process to his son, and has firmly denied that he was a ghost director on the project. He did not shoot a single frame, and did not even view some portions of the film until it was nearly completed.\n\n","h_score":1749402.1125,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":274258,"revid":1173344327,"description":"1995 film by Aditya Chopra","categories":["1990s Hindi-language films","1990s romantic comedy-drama films","1990s romantic musical films","1995 directorial debut films","1995 drama films","1995 films","Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment National Film Award winners","Films about Indian weddings","Films directed by Aditya Chopra","Films scored by Jatin\u2013Lalit","Films set in India","Films set in London","Films shot in London","Films shot in Switzerland","Hindi films remade in other languages","Indian romantic comedy-drama films","Indian romantic musical films","Yash Raj Films films"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge?  \nA1: It's a 1995 Bollywood romantic blockbuster directed by Aditya Chopra.\n\nQ2: Who are the lead actors?  \nA2: Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol star as charming lovers navigating cultural ties.\n\nQ3: What's the basic plot?  \nA3: It follows an NRI couple's journey to win family approval for their love.\n\nQ4: Why is it popular?  \nA4: Its catchy songs and heartfelt romance captured hearts worldwide with vibrant energy.\n\nQ5: What themes does it explore?  \nA5: Love, tradition, and identity blend in a tale of modern Indian dreams.\n\nQ6: How did it impact Bollywood?  \nA6: It set new standards for romance films, boosting the NRI narrative trend.\n\nQ7: What's its cultural significance?  \nA7: It celebrates family values while challenging norms, resonating across generations.\n\nQ8: Why is it still relevant?  \nA8: Its timeless love story and lively spirit continue to inspire global audiences."}

Moreover, Tahmasp also did not allow Ismail to enter Qazvin and instead, ordered his arrest in Saveh. Different reason are suggested for this act by the shah, mainly based upon Tahmasp's paranoia of Ismail's popularity; Ismail's recurrent attacks on the Ottoman borderlands and lastly, Tahmasp's outrage on Ismail's homosexuality and addiction to drugs. The shah ordered the imprisonment of Ismail in the Qahqaheh Castle in 1557, where he remained imprisoned for nineteen years. Tahmasp seems to be influenced by his grand vizier, Ma'sum Beg Safavi (who was also the lala to Haydar Mirza, his favourite son) to take this decision.\n\nIsmail's gaolers were replaced every two years to prevent them from becoming intimate with Ismail and developing sympathy towards him. Reportedly, during the initial period of his imprisonment, he was kept in shackles, but later he was allowed to walk to the castle's courtyard and return to his jail as he wished. However, in the rub\u0101\u02bfiy\u0101t (quatrains) attributed to Ismail, he laments of his incarceration in Qahqaha, ascribing it to his foes\u2019 resentment at his prowess and insight. His addiction to drugs increased greatly during his imprisonment, to the point when he consumed 47 misqal, equivalent to 199.75 grams (7.046 oz) of grain, of barsh, an antidote of opium, which he used while also taking opium.\n\nWhile Ismail was in Qahqaha, the Qizilbash leaders confronted Tahmasp with the question of succession, who did not desire to appoint any of his sons as the crown prince. There was two candidates, one was Haydar Mirza, the shah's favourite son, supported by the Ustajlu tribe, Shaykhavand clan (related to Sheikh Safi-ad-din Ardabili, the progenitor of the Safavid dynasty and hence the royal family in large) and the powerful court Georgian gholams (military slaves) and concubines.\n\nThe other candidate was Ismail, supported by Pari Khan Khanum, Tahmasp's influential daughter and the other Qizilbash tribes such as Afshar, Qajar and Rumlu. In 1571, Ismail survived a conspiracy. In that year, Haydar Mirza wrote a letter to the castellan of Qahqaha Castle, requesting him to eliminate Ismail. Pari Khan Khanum found out about this plan and informed Tahmasp. The king, who still held affection towards Ismail, ordered Afshar musketeers to guard his jail in case of an assassination attempt.\n\n ## Reign\n\n","h_score":1690249.875,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":5804544,"revid":1168842521,"description":"Safavid Shah of Iran (1537-1577) (r.1576-1577)","categories":["1537 births","1577 deaths","16th-century Iranian people","16th-century monarchs in the Middle East","16th-century people of Safavid Iran","Burials in Iran","Converts to Sunni Islam from Shia Islam","Iranian Sunni Muslims","LGBT heads of state","LGBT royalty","Mawsillu","Prisoners held at Qahqaheh Castle","Safavid governors of Herat","Safavid governors of Shirvan","Safavid monarchs"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Ismail II?  \nA1: Ismail II was a 16th-century Shah of Iran's Safavid Empire, known for his fiery reign.  \n\nQ2: When did he rule?  \nA2: He reigned briefly from 1576 to 1578, a turbulent era of power shifts.  \n\nQ3: What was his background?  \nA3: As son of Shah Tahmasp I, he hailed from a royal Persian dynasty with deep Shia roots.  \n\nQ4: How did he gain power?  \nA4: He ascended through family succession, amid palace intrigues and rival claims.  \n\nQ5: What policies did he enact?  \nA5: Ismail II promoted Shia Islam zealously and executed foes, sparking unrest.  \n\nQ6: Why is his reign significant?  \nA6: His short rule highlighted Safavid fragility, with echoes of violence in history's tapestry.  \n\nQ7: What challenges did he face?  \nA7: Internal rebellions and health woes plagued his time, leading to quick downfall.  \n\nQ8: What legacy did he leave?  \nA8: Ismail II's turbulent legacy shaped Safavid policies, a vivid footnote in Persian history."}

He took private rooms in a furnished hotel, and rented a room for his secretary. He visited his son and daughter-in-law, and carried on his usual Parisian social calendar: he appeared in all the public places, at the Palais-Royal and the theater, and was received with noisy ovations and shouts of Vive Custine! The Committee of Public Safety ordered a policeman to accompany him everywhere. On 22 July, he was arrested and imprisoned in the Luxembourg. On 23 July, the news came that Mainz had capitulated; on 28 July came the news of the loss of Valenciennes. He was transferred to the Conciergerie on 28 July, and his rooms, those of his secretary, and those of his son were sealed, pending a search.\n\nAfter three weeks of searches and examination, the public prosecutor Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville drew up the indictment: Custine's crime, according to the representatives on mission, was negligence, for allowing the Allies to take Cond\u00e9 and Valenciennes, and also for the loss of Mainz, a city that Custine had abandoned when occupation became untenable. During his trial, H\u00e9bert continued to attack Custine via his newspaper, the infamous P\u00e8re Duchene.\n\nThis time Robespierre did not defend Custine. Custine's lovely daughter-in-law came daily to the courthouse to sit at his feet; eventually, the prosecutors accused the judges of postponing a verdict so that they could continue to gaze at her.

They have a synagogue and openly practice the ceremonies of their religion, notwithstanding the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht ... The Genoese are traders, but the greater part of them are fishermen, traders and gardeners. Life for the ordinary soldiers of the garrison was tedious and harsh, with corporal punishment administered for even the most trivial offences. A drummer in the Lancashire Fusiliers became famous for being the most-flogged man in the British Army, receiving 30,000 lashes during his 14 years stationed at Gibraltar. Suicide and desertions were common due to boredom, shortages of food and the poor living conditions. At Middle Hill Battery, guards had to be posted to prevent soldiers from deserting by lowering themselves on ropes down the cliff face. One soldier wrote despairingly in his diary: > Here is nothing to do nor any news, all things being dormant and in suspense, with the harmless diversions of drinking, dancing, revelling, whoring, gaming, and other innocent debaucheries to pass the time \u2013 and really, to speak my own opinion I think and believe that Sodom and Gomorrah were not half so wicked and profane as this worthy city and garrison of Gibraltar. The fortifications of Gibraltar were modernised and upgraded in the 1770s with the construction of new batteries, bastions and curtain walls. The driving force behind this programme was the highly experienced Colonel (later Major General) William Green, who was to play a key role a few years later as chief engineer of Gibraltar. He was joined in 1776 by Lieutenant General George Augustus Elliott, a veteran of earlier wars against France and Spain who took over the governorship of Gibraltar at a key moment. Britain's successes in the Seven Years' War had left it with expensive commitments in the Americas that had to be paid for and had catalysed the formation of an anti-British coalition in Europe. The British Government's attempt to levy new taxes on the Thirteen Colonies of British America led to the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1776. Spain declared war on Britain and started the Anglo-Spanish War and then tried to recover Gibraltar with French aid. The Great Siege of Gibraltar lasted from 24 June 1779 to 7 February 1783 and remains one of the longest sieges endured by the British Armed Forces, as well as being one of the longest continuous sieges in history. A combined Spanish and French fleet blockaded Gibraltar from the sea, while on the land side an enormous army was engaged in constructing forts, redoubts, entrenchments, and batteries from which to attack Gibraltar. The Spanish committed increasing number of troops and ships to the siege, postponing the planned invasion of England by the Armada of 1779. The first relief of the siege came in the spring of 1780 when Admiral George Rodney captured a Spanish convoy off Cape Finesterre and defeated a Spanish fleet at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent, delivering reinforcements of 1,052 men and an abundance of supplies. The British defenders continued to resist every attempt to capture Gibraltar by assault but supplies again began to run low.","h_score":1706767.7125000001,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":27622457,"revid":1168049148,"description":"History of a peninsula on the Iberian coast","categories":["Geographic history of Spain","History of Gibraltar"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Gibraltar's Rocky Legacy\n\nGibraltar has served as a vital Mediterranean gateway since prehistoric times, witnessing Roman, Moorish, and Spanish rule.

While training at the Bukit Dumbar Squash Centre, David was talent spotted by Ee Phoeh Hoon, who led her to represent her home state of Penang, along with her sisters. David's squash career began in 1992 when she won silver in the Under-14 category of the Penang State Junior Championship. Her first national level victory was also in 1992 at the Milo-Dunlop Sport National Junior Interstate Championship, where she won silver in the Under-16 category. In 1994, David was chosen to join the Penang state squash team for the Malaysian Games (SUKMA) tournament where she helped Penang win a gold medal in the team event, despite being ill at the time. In the same year, she won her first two international titles \u2013 the Hong Kong U-13 and the Scottish Junior Open Under-12.\n\nDavid won the Women's World Junior Squash Championships of 1999 beating her compatriot Lynn Leong in the final in Antwerp, Belgium, making her the youngest woman to become the world junior champion at the age of 15. In the process, she defeated three players ranked in the world top 20. She successfully defended the title in Penang in 2001, becoming one of only two players in the history of squash to have won it twice; her coach was Richard Glanfield.\n\nIn 1999, David began to win major junior tournaments, including the British Junior Open (Under-17 champion), the German Junior Open (Under-19, Champion), the SEA Games (Champion in the Senior and Team categories), and the Asian Junior Champion for both individual and team events.\n\nDavid's biggest win, however, was the World Junior Championships, played in Antwerp. It took just half an hour for the then 15-year-old Malaysian schoolgirl to obtain world junior champion status when she beat compatriot Leong Siu Lynn 9\u20135, 9\u20133 and 9\u20132 in the final of the women's individual event to become the youngest ever winner of the title. David reached the quarterfinals of the previous World Junior Championships in August 1997 in Brazil, as a thirteen-year-old and has since claimed both the Asian junior and senior titles, as well as the gold medal in the Asian Games in December 1998. David also is one of a few squash player to have won all the age categories in the British Junior Open.\n\n","h_score":1736337.175,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":3046100,"revid":1171564243,"description":"Malaysian squash player","categories":["1983 births","Asian Games bronze medalists for Malaysia","Asian Games gold medalists for Malaysia","Asian Games medalists in squash","Asian Games silver medalists for Malaysia","Commanders of the Order of Meritorious Service","Commonwealth Games bronze medallists for Malaysia","Commonwealth Games gold medallists for Malaysia","Commonwealth Games medallists in squash","Commonwealth Games silver medallists for Malaysia","Competitors at the 2001 SEA Games","Competitors at the 2005 World Games","Competitors at the 2009 World Games","Competitors at the 2013 World Games","Competitors at the 2017 World Games","Living people","Malaysian Roman Catholics","Malaysian female squash players","Malaysian people of Chinese descent","Malaysian people of Indian descent","Malaysian socialites","Malaysian sportswomen","Medalists at the 1998 Asian Games","Medalists at the 2002 Asian Games","Medalists at the 2006 Asian Games","Medalists at the 2010 Asian Games","Medalists at the 2014 Asian Games","Medalists at the 2018 Asian Games","Medallists at the 2002 Commonwealth Games","Medallists at the 2010 Commonwealth Games","Medallists at the 2014 Commonwealth Games","Members of the Order of the Defender of the Realm","Officers of the Order of the Defender of the Realm","Recipients of the Order of Merit of Malaysia","SEA Games gold medalists for Malaysia","SEA Games medalists in squash","Sportspeople from Penang","Squash players at the 1998 Asian Games","Squash players at the 1998 Commonwealth Games","Squash players at the 2002 Asian Games","Squash players at the 2002 Commonwealth Games","Squash players at the 2006 Asian Games","Squash players at the 2006 Commonwealth Games","Squash players at the 2010 Asian Games","Squash players at the 2010 Commonwealth Games","Squash players at the 2014 Asian Games","Squash players at the 2014 Commonwealth Games","Squash players at the 2018 Asian Games","Squash players at the 2018 Commonwealth Games","World Games bronze medalists","World Games gold medalists","World Games medalists in squash"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Nicol David?  \nA1: Nicol David is a legendary Malaysian squash player, celebrated for her dominance in the sport.  \n\nQ2: Where was she born and raised?  \nA2: Born in 1983 in Penang, Malaysia, she grew up in a supportive family that nurtured her athletic talents.  \n\nQ3: When did she start playing squash?  \nA3: She began playing as a child in the 1990s, quickly rising through junior ranks with graceful precision.  \n\nQ4: What are her major achievements?  \nA4: She won eight world championships and multiple British Open titles, dominating from 2005 to 2015 like a force of nature.  \n\nQ5: How did she impact squash in Malaysia?  \nA5: Her successes sparked a squash boom in Malaysia, inspiring young athletes with her disciplined flair.  \n\nQ6: What challenges did she overcome?  \nA6: She battled injuries and fierce rivals, using resilience to fuel her victories on the court.  \n\nQ7: What is she doing now?  \nA7: Now retired, she focuses on philanthropy and business ventures, sharing her vibrant energy off the court.  \n\nQ8: What is her lasting legacy?  \nA8: As a national icon, she elevated squash globally and empowered women in sports with her enduring spirit."}

It is 335 metres (1,099 ft) long, running adjacent the Royal Albert Bridge, and part of the A38, a main road between the two counties.\n\nDuring the 20th century, there was increasing demand to replace or supplement the Saltash and Torpoint ferries, which could not cope with the rise in motor traffic. The Government refused to prioritise the project, so it was financed by Plymouth City Council and Cornwall County Council. Construction was undertaken by the Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company and began in 1959. It was unofficially opened in October 1961, with a formal presentation by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in April 1962. A reconstruction of the bridge began in 1999 after it was found to be unable to support a European Union requirement for goods vehicle weights. The work involved building two new parallel decks while the original construction was completely rebuilt. The project was completed in late 2001 and formally opened by Princess Anne in April 2002. The extra decks have remained in use, increasing the bridge's capacity.\n\nThe bridge is tolled for eastbound travel, with a discount available via an electronic payment scheme. It has become a significant landmark in Plymouth, Saltash and the surrounding area, and used on several occasions for protests or to highlight the work of charities and fundraisers.\n\n ## Location\n\nThe bridge runs over the River Tamar from near Wearde, Saltash in the west to Riverside, Plymouth in the east. It has a central span of 335 metres (1,099 ft) and two side spans of 114 metres (374 ft). It is part of the A38, a major cross-country road that runs across Cornwall and Devon, and lies immediately north of the Royal Albert Bridge, a significant railway bridge designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel that opened in 1859. Both bridges are north of the Hamoaze, the estuary that the Tamar feeds into, and the Torpoint Ferry.\n\nThe bridge is owned and maintained by the Tamar Bridge and Torpoint Ferry Joint Committee, a conglomerate between Plymouth City Council and Cornwall County Council. It has a main span of three lanes, which use a tidal flow arrangement to maximise traffic flow at rush hour, and two outer lanes. The north of these is used as a local access route from Saltash, while the south is used by cyclists and pedestrians but could be converted to meet future vehicle demand if alternatives for pedestrians and bicycles were provided, a dedicated ferry, shuttle bus, cable car or bridge have been considered.\n\n ### Tolls\n\nThe current tolls are \u00a32.60 for cars, and \u00a36.30, \u00a310.40 and \u00a314.30 for 2, 3 and 4-axle goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes respectively. An electronic device called the Tamar Tag can be affixed to a vehicle window, which allows the driver to travel at half-fare. Tolls are only payable when travelling eastbound from Saltash to Plymouth.\n\nThere is no charge for pedestrians, cyclists and motorcycles. Disabled drivers can apply for concessions online or via an office next to the Torpoint Ferry.\n\n ## Construction\n\n ### Requirement\n\nFor centuries, road users wishing to go from Saltash to Plymouth had two main options. Travel by coach involved a long detour north either to Gunnislake New Bridge (a one-lane bridge constructed in 1520), or other bridges further north along the Devon \u2013 Cornwall border. The alternative was to catch a ferry across the Tamar. The Torpoint Ferry had been running successfully since 1791 (and is still in active service) while the Saltash Ferry ran near to the bridge's present location. While popular, the ferries did not have sufficient capacity by the 20th century to cater for motor traffic. The idea for a fixed crossing across the Tamar had been floated around since the early 19th century, and proposals had been discussed in Parliament as early as 1930.\n\nIn 1950, Cornwall County Council and Plymouth City Council discussed the feasibility of building a road bridge. The government was unenthusiastic about the idea, as they did not believe it was financially viable and there were more urgent projects in post-war Britain. After being rebuked, both councils agreed to self-fund the entire project, which would be paid for in tolls. The scheme received Royal Assent in July 1957. Invitations to tender were sent on 4 March 1959, and a proposal from the northeast England-based Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company was accepted on 9 June.\n\n ### Building\n\nPreparatory work on the bridge started in July 1959. The bridge was built using suspended construction, which involved building two 67 metres (220 ft) concrete towers with support cables over these. Hangers were attached to these cables and the road deck was transported by barge and lifted into place. Cleveland Bridge and Engineering later used the same technique to construct the first Severn Bridge.\n\nThe central span of the bridge was 1,848 feet (563 m). The support cables were both 2,200 feet (670 m) long, with a combined weight of 850 tons. They were constructed for Cleveland Bridge and Engineering by British Ropes Ltd. The deck was made out of a concrete base covered with 20-millimetre (0.79 in) steel plates approx and 200-millimetre (7.9 in) of standard road tarmac. The roadway catered for three lanes of traffic and was designed to be 33 feet (10 m) wide, with an additional 6 feet (1.8 m) for pedestrians either side of the bridge. It could support an estimated capacity of 20,000 vehicles a day, with a maximum individual vehicle weight of 38 tons. Bridge materials had a similar colour to the Royal Albert Bridge, which it runs parallel to.\n\nThe bridge was unofficially opened at 6am on 24 October 1961, when the construction barriers were removed. It was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother on 26 April 1962.\n\nThe total cost of the bridge was \u00a31.8 million (now \u00a3 million). It was the first major suspension bridge to be constructed in the UK after World War II, and the longest suspension bridge in Britain.\n\n ### Operation\n\nThe initial toll for cars was 3s (15p) for a single journey across the bridge, or 4\/6 (221\u20442p) for a return, while for lorries it was 14s (70p) and \u00a31 respectively. The Saltash Ferry closed, but the Torpoint Ferry remained in operation; management of the ferry and the bridge is shared so the two crossings are not in direct competition with each other.\n\nBy 1979, the toll had risen to 30p for a single car journey. It had risen again to \u00a31 by 1995, which remained in place until 2010, when they were increased to \u00a31.50. On 19 November 2019 the new standard toll was set at \u00a32.00.\n\nIn 1961, approximately 4000 vehicles used the Tamar Bridge each day. This significantly increased in the following decades; in 1998 the hourly rate during the morning rush hour was 2500 vehicles. The average weekday saw 38,200 vehicles cross the bridge and the summer weekday flow was 42,900. Conversely, the Torpoint ferry link could transport a maximum of 300 vehicles per hour.\n\n","h_score":1745069.1062500002,"h_score_cat":7,"pageid":144983,"revid":1164253699,"description":"Suspension bridge in southwest England","categories":["Bridges completed in 1961","Bridges in Cornwall","Bridges in Devon","Buildings and structures in Plymouth, Devon","River Tamar","Suspension bridges in the United Kingdom","Toll bridges in England","Transport in Plymouth, Devon"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's the Tamar Bridge, you ask?  \nA1: It's a steel symphony arching over the River Tamar, linking Plymouth to Saltash like a playful giant's leap.  \n\nQ2: Where does this bridge strut its stuff?  \nA2: In southwest England, crossing from Devon to Cornwall, it's a scenic gateway to coastal dreams.  \n\nQ3: When was this marvel born?  \nA3: Built in the 1960s, it upgraded an older span, evolving from humble roots to a modern icon.  \n\nQ4: What's its design flair?  \nA4: A suspension beauty with cables like harp strings, blending engineering smarts with river-hugging elegance.  \n\nQ5: Why does it matter to folks?  \nA5: It knits communities, eases daily commutes, and sparks tourism with its vivid vistas of swirling waters.  \n\nQ6: Any quirky tales?  \nA6: Once a toll bridge with traffic jams, it's now a canvas for sunsets, whispering history's secrets.  \n\nQ7: How does it shape local life?  \nA7: It boosts trade, fosters unity, but battles weather woes, reminding us of nature's wild dance.  \n\nQ8: What's next for this bridge?  \nA8: Maintenance tweaks and eco-upgrades loom, ensuring it remains a timeless, twinkling thread in England's tapestry."}

The Los Angeles Times said, \"[The film is] overstuffed with plot lines, set pieces and villains, although stars Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone do their best to give the movie heart.\" Tim Robey of The Telegraph said, \"Marc Webb's Spider-Man sequel is overstuffed with high-voltage villains, but the sparks between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone save the day\". Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy said, \"Peter's past, present and future all intertwine in a sequel that offers bang for your buck. That said you can't help [but] feel the franchise bean counters at work here thanks to all the ominous foreshadowing and unresolved character arcs. Too many cooks and all that ...\". Kim Newman of Empire scored the film three out of five stars, saying: \"A few too-broad gags aside\u2014and even these are in the funky spirit of '60s Marvel\u2014this is a satisfying second issue with thrills, heartbreak, gasps, and a perfectly judged slingshot ending.\" Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter said, \"The eponymous hero hits his super-heroic stride here, as does Andrew Garfield in the role, especially when Spider-Man's alter ego Peter Parker learns there's always some fine print in a contract with this many benefits. The plot gets itself tangled up in multiple villain strands, but in the main, this installment is emotionally weightier and more satisfying than its predecessor.\" Guy Lodge of Variety said, \"Redundancy remains a problem, but this overlong superhero sequel gets by on sound, fury, and star chemistry.\" Richard Roeper gave the film a B+, stating that \"It's about 20 minutes too long and it's overstuffed with too many characters and too many subplots, but there's enough good stuff in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 to warrant optimism about the next chapter of the franchise.\" A negative review came from Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, giving the film two stars out of four, he said: \"Things go wrong quickly with Amazing 2. Am I the only one who hates the word Amazing to describe a movie that isn't? Just asking.\" IGN reviewer Daniel Krupa gave 6.9\/10 and wrote, \"Amazing Spider-Man 2 gets a lot right, yet there's a constant awkwardness to the machinery of its plot; you can almost hear the cogs turning. However, what's worse is that at times it becomes overtly patronising: there are flashing screens and computer voice-overs constantly telling you what something is or what something is doing, just in case the people in the back rows aren't paying attention, which feels at odds with the film's emotional intelligence.\" William Harrison of DVD Talk rated the film as 3.5 stars of 5 stars as \"Recommended\". ### Accolades\n\n ## Future\n\n","h_score":1830243.6812500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":35625166,"revid":1173605637,"description":"2014 superhero film directed by Marc Webb","categories":["2010s American films","2010s English-language films","2010s superhero films","2014 3D films","2014 films","2014 science fiction action films","2014 science fiction films","American 3D films","American films about revenge","American science fiction action films","American sequel films","Biopunk films","Columbia Pictures films","Fictional portrayals of the New York City Police Department","Films about genetic engineering","Films about the New York City Police Department","Films directed by Marc Webb","Films produced by Avi Arad","Films produced by Matt Tolmach","Films scored by Hans Zimmer","Films scored by Johnny Marr","Films scored by Junkie XL","Films scored by Mike Einziger","Films scored by Pharrell Williams","Films set in 2014","Films set in New York City","Films shot in New York (state)","Films shot in New York City","Films using motion capture","Films with screenplays by Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci","Green Goblin","IMAX films","Live-action films based on Marvel Comics","Spider-Man films","Teen superhero films","The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film series)"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the basic plot of The Amazing Spider-Man 2?  \nA1: The film follows Peter Parker as Spider-Man fighting villains in New York.

Established in 1886, the park encompasses 1,349 km<sup>2<\/sup> (521 sq mi), and includes a portion of the Selkirk Mountains which are part of the larger grouping of mountains, the Columbia Mountains. It also contains the Rogers Pass National Historic Site.\n\nThe park's history is closely tied to two primary Canadian transportation routes, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), completed in 1885, and the Trans-Canada Highway, completed in 1963. Rogers Pass in the centre of the park eluded explorers until 1881. The railway brought with it tourism, the establishment of Glacier National Park and the construction of a popular alpine hotel. The heavy winter snows and steep, avalanche-prone valleys of the park have been a major obstacle to transportation, necessitating much railway engineering and avalanche control measures.\n\nThe park contains high peaks, large, active glaciers, and one of Canada's largest cave systems. Its dense forests support populations of large mammals, birds, and alpine species. The region is noted for its heavy snowfall. The park has an extensive network of trails, three campgrounds, and four backcountry huts and cabins. Due to the major transportation routes that bisect it, Glacier National Park sees large numbers of visitors.\n\n ## History\n\nThe Selkirk Mountains were first noted by Europeans when explorer David Thompson of the North West Company skirted around them on the Columbia River in 1811. He named them Nelson's Mountains, after Lord Horatio Nelson, but they were later renamed after an executive for the rival Hudson's Bay Company, Lord Thomas Douglas Selkirk.\n\nFinding a pass through the Selkirks became a priority after construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway began. Completion of the railway was a condition of the Colony of British Columbia upon entering Canadian Confederation in 1867. In 1865, Canadian Pacific Surveyor Walter Moberly led an expedition up the Illecillewaet River (which he named, using the Okanangan word for \"swift water\"). Despite recently discovering Eagle Pass through the nearby Monashees, Moberly failed to find a pass through the Selkirks after getting sidetracked in the Tangier Creek drainage. His party refused to explore further due to the lateness of the season, and Moberly was forced to retreat.\n\n ### Rogers Pass\n\nAn expedition led by Major Albert Bowman Rogers up the Illecillewaet discovered a viable pass in 1881. Rogers was awarded a five thousand dollar prize for locating a route through the mountains. In 1885, the CPR constructed a line through Rogers Pass and the following year trains were travelling west to the Pacific for the first time in Canada. The federal government and the CPR quickly realized the tourism potential of the mountainous, heavily glaciated area. Following a trip by Prime Minister John A. Macdonald and his wife Agnes through the Rockies on the newly completed Trancontinental Railroad, he returned to Ottawa inspired, and led the creation of Glacier and Yoho National Parks, both established on October 10, 1886. They were the second and third national parks in the country, after Banff, a year earlier.\n\n ### Glacier House\n\nThe grade of the railway approaching Rogers Pass was too steep to allow for dining cars on the trains, so the CPR built a hotel west of the pass in 1886. This added to a collection of CPR-owned hotels across Canada, including Mount Stephen House in Yoho National Park, built in the same year and with the same floor plan. Glacier House, located near the terminus of the Illecillewaet Glacier (called the Great Glacier at the time), became a centre for tourism, mountaineering, glaciology, and photography in the Selkirks. The hotel was expanded in 1905 and 1911. It was considered one of western Canada's premier tourist destinations at the turn of the twentieth century.\n\nThe hotel attracted alpinists from around the world. Owing to its elevation, climbers could be in the high alpine within hours of leaving their room. In 1899, the CPR contracted the services of several Swiss guides to assist the less mountain-savvy tourists through the high country. Throughout the Glacier House period, many first ascents were made on peaks within the park. The hotel also attracted naturalists and scientists keen to study the mountain environment. Mary Vaux Walcott and her brothers, George and William Vaux, visited the area many times, and began the first scientific studies of the Illecillewaet Glacier.\n\n ### Mountaineering\n\nGlacier House is considered \"the first center (sic) of alpinism\" in North America by American Alpine Club historian William Lowell Putnam. It saw an influx of European and American professional climbers in its first two decades of operation. William Spotswood Green was the first European climber to make note of the excellent climbing possibilities of peaks near the CPR line. Green and Henry Swanzy made the first recorded ascents of major peaks in the summer of 1888, climbing Mount Bonney and Green's Peak. Harold Topham, a British climber, made many first ascents in 1890 including Mount Fox; he later joined with Henry Forster, and two Swiss climbers, Emil Huber and Carl Sulzer to explore the southern peaks of the park. Huber and Sulzer also claimed the prized first ascent of the dramatic Mount Sir Donald.\n\nArthur Oliver Wheeler, a cartographer, climber, and founding member of the Alpine Club of Canada (ACC), came to Glacier House in 1901. This started a thirty-year relationship with the northern Selkirks, which saw Wheeler map the region, publish large reference works on its geography, and explore much of the park's terrain. An ACC hut near the Illecillewaet campground bears his name, as well as a peak and a pass. Professor Charles Ernest Fay, first president of the American Alpine Club, after visiting the park in the 1890s, publicized it in the club's magazine. By the 1900s, almost all of the park's prominent peaks had seen human tracks.\n\n ### Connaught Tunnel and the Trans-Canada Highway\n\nAfter its first winter in operation in 1886, it became clear to the CPR that the heavy snows of Rogers Pass were going to be a serious challenge. Extensive snow sheds were built to shelter the rails from frequent avalanches. These wood sheds became a fire hazard in the summer months, so a separate summer track was built. In 1910, while clearing one slide, another avalanche came down Avalanche Mountain, killing 62 men. More than half the workers killed in the slide were of Japanese descent. In all, two hundred railway employees were killed between 1886 and 1916. In 1912, the CPR admitted defeat and started the construction of an eight-kilometre tunnel under the pass and Mount Macdonald. The Connaught Tunnel opened in 1916.\n\nThe new tunnel bypassed Glacier House's siding, and the resulting lack of rail passengers spelled the end for the once-popular hotel. It was closed in 1925, and torn down four years later. The park saw few visitors besides campers from the Alpine Club of Canada's summer camps for the next thirty years. Until this point, automobile travellers crossing the Columbia Mountains had to use the circuitous Big Bend Highway, which followed the upper reaches of the Columbia River north in a large loop. With the planned inundation of much of that valley by hydro projects outlined in the Columbia River Treaty, a new highway route was needed. In 1963, the Trans-Canada Highway was built through Rogers Pass, bringing tourists back to the park in large numbers. Parks Canada built several new campgrounds and expanded the trail system.\n\n ## Geography\n\nThe park covers the northern part of the Selkirk Mountains, a sub-range of the Columbia Mountains. It contains numerous glaciers and large, swift waterways. The park is bisected by two major transportation routes, the Trans-Canada Highway and the Canadian Pacific Railway. The nearest towns are Revelstoke to the west, and Golden to the east.\n\n ### Mountains\n\nThe Columbia Mountains rise from the plateaus of the Central Interior and extend eastward to the Rocky Mountain Trench. Geologically distinct from the nearby Rockies, the range is divided into four sub-ranges: the Cariboos, Monashees, Selkirks, and the Purcells. Glacier encompasses a portion of the northern Selkirks and a narrow strip of the northern Purcells. The topography of the park varies between rounded mountains and ridges in the east, north, and west, and sharp, steep-sided peaks in the central and southern regions. A.O. Wheeler measured many of the park's mountains in 1901 and 1902 using a complex system of fixed points and photographs. In the early 20th century, the area was referred to as the \"Canadian Alps\". Most names are from historical figures, including explorers, surveyors, mountaineers, and railway and Hudson's Bay Company executives.\n\n #### Major peaks and ranges\n\nThe highest point in the park is Mount Dawson, at 3,377 metres (11,079 ft). The precipitous Mount Sir Donald stands at 3,284 metres (10,774 ft), Mount Macdonald at 2,883 metres (9,459 ft), Mount McNicoll at 2,610 metres (8,560 ft), and Mount Abbott at 2,465 metres (8,087 ft). Peaks of the Hermit Range, the Bonney and Bostock Groups, the Van Horne Range, Purity Range and the Dawson Range, all lie wholly or in part within the park, including Uto Peak at 2,927 metres (9,603 ft) in the Sir Donald Range.\n\n","h_score":1840887.0562500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1415629,"revid":1159339352,"description":"Canadian national park located in British Columbia","categories":["Columbia Country","Glacier National Park (Canada)","National parks in British Columbia","Parks in British Columbia","Protected areas established in 1886","Selkirk Mountains"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's Glacier National Park?  \nA1: It's a Canadian gem in the Rockies, boasting ancient glaciers and jagged peaks like frozen time capsules.  \n\nQ2: Where is it located?  \nA2: In British Columbia, straddling the U.S. border, where mountains kiss the sky.  \n\nQ3: When was it established?  \nA3: Founded in 1886, it's a historic playground of ice and adventure.  \n\nQ4: What are its main features?  \nA4: Glaciers, turquoise lakes, and wildflower meadows paint a vivid, ever-changing canvas.  \n\nQ5: What's the wildlife like?  \nA5: Grizzlies roam, eagles soar, and elusive caribou hide in this lively, untamed theater.  \n\nQ6: What activities can visitors enjoy?  \nA6: Hiking trails, skiing slopes, and rafting rivers offer playful thrills amid icy wonders.  \n\nQ7: Are there environmental concerns?  \nA7: Climate change shrinks glaciers, threatening this fragile, poetic ecosystem's heartbeat.  \n\nQ8: Why is it culturally significant?  \nA8: It honors Indigenous heritage while inspiring global conservation, a whimsical guardian of Earth's secrets."}

The expressway is formed from the median lanes of the HEFT, and immediately turns to the northeast, passing under the HEFT's northbound lanes. Southbound HEFT traffic cannot access northbound SR 874; likewise, southbound SR 874 traffic cannot access the HEFT northbound. After turning to the northeast and entering Kendall, the six-laned Don Shula Expressway subsequently parallels CSX's Homestead Subdivision past predominantly residential neighborhoods for its entire route. SR 874 meets its first of three toll gantries about 1.4 miles (2.3 km) north of its southern terminus, just north of its former lone toll plaza.\n\nAbout two miles (3.2 km) from SR 874's southern terminus, the expressway interchanges with Killian Parkway (SR 990) and Southwest 107th Avenue (SR 985) at a partial cloverleaf interchange. The Don Shula Expressway continues on for 1.1 miles (1.8 km), passing through another toll gantry, before reaching an interchange with Kendall Drive (SR 94). Almost immediately afterwards, SR 874 crosses the Snapper Creek Canal and enters the Sunset district. It then reaches the partial interchange with the Snapper Creek Expressway (SR 878); indeed, southbound motorists along the Don Shula Expressway who wish to exit to Kendall Drive are directed onto the westernmost portion of SR 878. Once past the Snapper Creek Expressway, SR 874 features no interchanges for the remainder of its route. Just north of the bridge over Sunset Drive (SR 986), about one-half mile (800 m) north of SR 878, motorists in both directions are provided with a separated lane to take their vehicles to if caught in an accident. One-quarter mile (400 m) past the accident investigation sites, the Don Shula Expressway swings north over the railroad, crossing over Galloway Road (SR 973) in the process, and resumes its northeasterly orientation, now forming the boundary between the communities of Olympia Heights, to the road's north, and Glenvar Heights, to the south. 0.6 miles (970 m) later, SR 874 passes through its third and final toll gantry, before reaching its northern terminus in a partial interchange with the Palmetto Expressway after another one mile (1.6 km). Like at its southern terminus, SR 874 forms the central lanes of SR 826 northbound; however, its interchange is integrated with SR 826's interchange with Bird Road (SR 976). Also like its southern terminus, there is no access for northbound SR 874 or SR 826 traffic to the other route's southbound counterpart.\n\n ## Tolls\n\nSR 874's tolls are entirely electronic: cash cannot be accepted along its length. Payment is done either via SunPass transponders or via toll-by-plate billing, the latter of which attracts a higher cost. Three toll gantries are located along the Don Shula Expressway: the first between the HEFT and Killian Parkway, the second between Killian Parkway and Kendall Drive, and the last between the Snapper Creek and Palmetto Expressways. The relationship between the tolling points and interchanges along SR 874 and SR 878 is that all motorists are charged at least one toll for using the road; there are no \"free sections\". As of July 1, 2013, the cost for a two-axled vehicle to drive the entire length of SR 874 is \\$1.00 with a SunPass transponder, or \\$2.00 via the toll-by-plate program, with the two southern gantries charging \\$0.25 (SunPass) or \\$0.50 (toll-by-plate) each, and the northern one charging twice as much. Each additional axle on a vehicle attracts a surcharge equal to the cost of a two-axled vehicle for each gantry passed.\n\n","h_score":1769738.3187500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":2556042,"revid":1162350386,"description":"Highway in Florida","categories":["Freeways in the United States","State Roads in Miami-Dade County, Florida","State highways in Florida","Toll roads in Florida"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Florida's SR 874: A Toll Road Tango\n\nSR 874, the Don Shula Expressway, dances through Miami's sprawl as a key connector for commuters, blending speed and frustration in equal measure.

The weekly passenger train having left Alice Springs the day before, railwaymen cobbled together a three-car train for MacArthur, his family, Sutherland, Morhouse and Huff to take them southwards on the decrepit railway, adding a sleeping car at a siding on the way. Two Australian sergeants were aboard to serve meals; an army nurse undertook the housekeeping. To reach the dining or sleeping car, passengers had to wait until the locomotive stopped, then get off and walk along the train. But there were many stops, and the train often had to lay over in crossing loops because opposing it on the single track were trains conveying supplies and men to the north.\n\nIt took 48 hours of traveling at no more than 20 miles per hour (32 kilometers per hour) before the party disembarked from their \"ancient conveyance\", on the morning of 20 March, at Terowie where all traffic, passengers and freight alike, had to change to broad-gauge trains.\n\nHaving thought his whereabouts would have been secret, MacArthur was alarmed to find crowds, a military guard of honor and reporters waiting for his 9 am arrival. The reporters' expectations of a briefing were unmet: he simply said that his policy during operations was to limit himself completely to the briefest publicity and to confine such statements to general releases from his headquarters. He followed briefly with the reason he was in Australia and concluded with a catchphrase that both alluded to his perilous journey and embodied his single-minded focus on liberating the Philippines that became widely publicized during the next three years: \"I came through and I shall return\".\n\nThe new train for the 150 miles (240 km) journey to Adelaide through a cooler, grassy region of South Australia was more commodious and, as a special movement, much faster. Comfort was incomparably better, since the South Australian Railways Commissioner had included his personal carriage, normally used for inspections, in the train hurriedly prepared for the party. Somewhat refreshed but still greatly fatigued, the family arrived in Adelaide in the early afternoon, to be met on the platform at the Adelaide railway station by senior U.S. and Australian army officers, diplomats and local dignitaries. The carriages, including the Commissioner's carriage at the back, departed for Melbourne at 7 pm attached to The Overland express.\n\nAt 9 am on 21 March, MacArthur's journey ended when his train arrived at Melbourne's Spencer Street station, where he was greeted by the Australian Minister for the Army, Frank Forde.\n\n","h_score":1796395.2750000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":36034784,"revid":1166263008,"description":"World War II escape","categories":["1942 in the Philippines","Douglas MacArthur","March 1942 events","Military history of the Philippines during World War II","PT boats","Voyages"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### General MacArthur's Daring Escape\n\nIn 1942, General Douglas MacArthur was ordered to flee the Japanese-occupied Philippines to continue leading Allied forces from Australia.

The event was seen by over one million viewers through closed-circuit television, making it the largest pay-per-view showing of a wrestling event on closed-circuit television in the United States at the time.\n\nThe event consisted of nine professional wrestling matches. In the main event, Hulk Hogan and Mr. T defeated Paul Orndorff and Roddy Piper. Also, Wendi Richter (accompanied by manager Cyndi Lauper) defeated Leilani Kai to win the WWF Women's Championship, and Nikolai Volkoff and The Iron Sheik defeated The U.S. Express (Mike Rotundo and Barry Windham) to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. Celebrity guests included former heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali as referee, baseball player\/manager Billy Martin as ring announcer, and musician-actor Liberace as timekeeper.\n\n ## Production\n\nThe attendance at the event was 19,121. In addition, the event was seen by over one million viewers through closed-circuit television, making it the largest wrestling event on closed-circuit television in the United States at the time. A technical glitch ended the closed circuit broadcast early into the showing at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. To appease angry fans who pelted the screen with garbage, WrestleMania was broadcast in its entirety on local ABC affiliate WTAE-TV two weeks later.\n\nWWF announcer Gene Okerlund sang the national anthem, and Gorilla Monsoon and Jesse Ventura performed on commentary. Okerlund also did interviews backstage, and Alfred Hayes did interviews near the entrance to the locker room, right outside the ring. Howard Finkel was the ring announcer.

In the sequence with the death of Ellie's father, they planned to use an effect similar to bullet time from The Matrix to show him stopped in time as he died. As the movie was filmed, they found the approach didn't fit the casting or the direction the film was going. They decided it would be most effective to create something distressing but with Ellie's dad absent from the shot, leading to the development of the mirror sequence. The decoding of the extraterrestrial message, with its architectural drawings of the machine, was created by Ken Ralston and Sony Pictures Imageworks. It was Zemeckis's and Ralston's sixth film collaboration. Imageworks created more than 350 visual effect shots, using a combination of model and miniature shots and digital graphics. On designing the Machine, Zemeckis said, \"The Machine in Sagan's novel was somewhat vague, which is fine for a book. In a movie, though, if you're going to build a giant physical structure of alien design, you have to make it believable... It had to be huge, so that the audience would feel like it was bigger than man should be tinkering with. It had to look absolutely real.\" The machine was then designed by concept artist Steve Burg, reusing a design he created as a \"time-displacement device\" for an unused scene in Terminator 2. Early conceptual designs of the Pod were based, as in the novel, on one of the primary shapes in geometry: a dodecahedron, or a twelve-sided body. Eventually it was modified to a spherical capsule that encased the traveler, with a dodecahedron surrounding the sphere. Zemeckis and the production crew also made several visits to the Kennedy Space Center at Merritt Island adjacent to Cape Canaveral, where officials gave them access to sites off-limits to most visitors. Filmmakers were also brought onto Launch Complex 39 before the launch of the Space Shuttle, where they studied the mechanics of the elevator, gantry area and loading arm for the design of the Machine's surrounding supports and gantry. Once the concept met with the filmmakers' approval, physical construction began on the sets for the Pod, elevator interior and gantry, which took almost four months. The rest of the effects were compiled digitally by Imageworks. The climactic scene depicting the mysterious beach near the galactic core where Arroway makes contact, in particular, called for major visual innovations. The goal was an idyllic seashore with a sky blazing with stars that might exist near the core of the galaxy. Ralston said that \"the thought was that this beach would have a heightened reality. One that might make the everyday world seem like a vague daydream.\" To keep the question alive whether any of it was real in Arroway's mind, elements such as ocean waves running in reverse and palm tree shadows swaying with sped-up motion were applied. The Hitler newsreel also required digital manipulation. ### Music\n\nThe original score was composed by Alan Silvestri, most of which was released on August 19, 1997, by Warner Bros. Records.

Alweo's father was Eowa, who may have shared the throne for some time with his brother, Penda. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle does not mention Eowa; though it does date Penda's reign as the thirty years from 626 to 656, when Penda was killed at the battle of the Winwaed. Two later sources also name Eowa as king: the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae. The Annales Cambriae is the source for Eowa's death in 644 at the battle of Maserfield, where Penda defeated Oswald of Northumbria. Details on Penda's reign are scarce, and it is a matter for speculation whether Eowa was an underking, owing allegiance to Penda, or if instead Eowa and Penda had divided Mercia between them. If they did divide the kingdom, it is likely that Eowa ruled northern Mercia, as Penda's son Peada was established later as the king of southern Mercia by the Northumbrian Oswiu, who defeated the Mercians and killed Penda in 656. It is possible that Eowa fought against Penda at Maserfield. During \u00c6thelbald's youth, Penda's dynasty ruled Mercia; Ceolred, a grandson of Penda and therefore a second cousin of \u00c6thelbald, was king of Mercia from 709 to 716. An early source, Felix's Life of Saint Guthlac, reveals that it was Ceolred who drove \u00c6thelbald into exile. Guthlac was a Mercian nobleman who abandoned a career of violence to become first a monk at Repton Abbey, and later a hermit living in a barrow at Crowland, in the East Anglian fens. During \u00c6thelbald's exile he and his men also took refuge in the Fens in the area, and visited Guthlac. Guthlac was sympathetic to \u00c6thelbald's cause, perhaps because of Ceolred's oppression of the monasteries. Other visitors of Guthlac's included Bishop Haedde of Lichfield, an influential Mercian, and it may be that Guthlac's support was politically useful to \u00c6thelbald in gaining the throne. After Guthlac's death, \u00c6thelbald had a dream in which Guthlac prophesied greatness for him, and \u00c6thelbald later rewarded Guthlac with a shrine when he had become king. When Ceolred died of a fit at a banquet, \u00c6thelbald returned to Mercia and became ruler. It is possible that a king named Ceolwald, perhaps a brother of Ceolred, reigned for a short while between Ceolred and \u00c6thelbald. \u00c6thelbald's accession ended Penda's line of descent; \u00c6thelbald's reign was followed, after a brief interval, by that of Offa, another descendant of Eowa. Other than his father, Alweo, little of \u00c6thelbald's immediate family is known, although in the witness list of two charters a leading ealdorman named Heardberht is recorded as his brother.","h_score":1812004.58125,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":84137,"revid":1161235940,"description":"8th-century King of Mercia","categories":["757 deaths","8th-century English monarchs","Anglo-Saxon warriors","Burials at St. Wystan's Church, Repton","House of Icel","Mercian monarchs","Year of birth unknown"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Unearthing \u00c6thelbald: Mercia's Shadowy Warlord\n\n\u00c6thelbald ruled Mercia from 716 to 757 AD, transforming it into a dominant Anglo-Saxon powerhouse through aggressive expansion and shrewd alliances.

In January 1074, the general Badr al-Jamali assumed the vizierate and proceeded to restore peace and order in the country and repel a Seljuk invasion, saving al-Mustansir's life and his dynasty; but at the cost of al-Mustansir delegating all his powers over the government, army, and the religious and judicial administration to him.\n\n","h_score":1774649.0437500002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":2193582,"revid":1173738369,"description":"Fatimid caliph and imam (1074\u20131101)","categories":["1074 births","1101 deaths","11th-century Fatimid caliphs","12th-century Fatimid caliphs","Egyptian Ismailis","Muslims of the First Crusade","Musta'li imams","Sons of Fatimid caliphs","Year of birth uncertain"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Al-Musta'li?  \nA1: Al-Musta'li was the ninth Fatimid caliph, a key figure in Islamic history.\n\nQ2: What was his title and role?  \nA2: He served as Imam and caliph, leading Ismaili Shia Muslims with religious authority.\n\nQ3: When did he rule?  \nA3: He reigned from 1094 to 1101 AD, a brief but pivotal era.\n\nQ4: How did he ascend to power?  \nA4: He succeeded his father, al-Mustansir, amid family disputes that shaped his legacy.\n\nQ5: What events defined his reign?  \nA5: He navigated Crusader threats and internal schisms, testing his leadership.\n\nQ6: How did he impact Ismailism?  \nA6: His rule sparked the Nizari-Musta'li split, altering Shia branches forever.\n\nQ7: What challenges did he face?  \nA7: External invasions and succession rivalries plagued his court, like storms on a desert.\n\nQ8: What is his lasting legacy?  \nA8: He founded a enduring Ismaili sect, influencing modern faith and history's tapestry."}

They were known as the Forty Shilling Freeholders. The franchise for borough seats varied enormously. Originally in Peterborough the dean and chapter had claimed the franchise and held that only residents of Minster Precincts were burgesses. By the interregnum, the city was one of 37 boroughs in which suffrage was restricted to those paying scot and lot, a form of municipal taxation. In 1800 there were 2,000 registered voters in Northamptonshire and 400 in Peterborough. By 1835 this was 576, or about one per cent of the population. Bribery was general until the introduction of the secret ballot under the Ballot Act 1872. Votes were cast by spoken declaration, in public, at the hustings, erected on the Market Place (now Cathedral Square).\n\nIn 1832 the Great Reform Act enfranchised those who owned or leased land worth \u00a310 or more and the Second Reform Act extended this to all householders paying \u00a310 or more in rent per annum, effectively enfranchising the skilled working class, so by 1868 the percentage of voters in Peterborough had risen to about 20% of the population. The Third Reform Act extended the provisions of the previous act to the counties and the Fourth Reform Act widened suffrage further by abolishing practically all property qualifications for men and by enfranchising women over 30 who met minimum property qualifications. This system, known as universal manhood suffrage, was first used in the 1918 general election.

It was held by a task force commanded by the Croatian soldier and diplomat Nikola Juri\u0161i\u0107. K\u0151szeg was not considered a place of importance. It was an insubstantial obstacle and many stronger places had yielded without a fight. The Grand Vizier of the Ottomans, Ibrahim Pasha, did not realize how poorly defended K\u0151szeg was. After taking a few minor places, Suleiman came to join Ibrahim Pasha shortly afterwards, when the siege had already started.\n\nThe Ottomans met stiff resistance at K\u0151szeg. Suleiman had hoped that the imperial army would come to relieve K\u0151szeg, affording him an opportunity for a larger engagement. However, during the Ottoman attacks on K\u0151szeg, the imperial army still formed up in Regensburg. The Ottomans continued with one attack after another; artillery fire brought down parts of the walls, but brought no surrender. The Ottomans' mines were sapped by countermines. The layout of K\u0151szeg's walls made mining a feasible strategy, but even though several mines succeeded in blowing holes in the fortifications, the defenders held out. For more than twenty-five days, without any artillery, Captain Nikola Juri\u0161i\u0107 and his garrison of 800 Croat soldiers held out against nineteen full-scale assaults and an incessant bombardment by the Ottomans.\n\nThere are two versions of the outcome. In the first version, Nikola Juri\u0161i\u0107 rejected the offer to surrender on favourable terms, and the Ottomans retreated. In the second version, the city was offered terms for a nominal surrender. The only Ottomans who would be allowed to enter the castle would be a token force who would raise the Ottoman flag.\n\nIn both versions, Suleiman withdrew at the arrival of the August rains, and returned homeward instead of continuing towards Vienna as previously planned. He had been delayed nearly four weeks, and during this time a powerful army had been collected in Vienna, which Suleiman did not intend to face. According to historian Paolo Giovio, Charles arrived with an imperial army at Vienna on 23 September, too late to fight the Ottomans because Suleiman had already withdrawn. By their defense of K\u0151szeg, Nikola Juri\u0161i\u0107 and his men had saved Vienna from a siege.\n\n ## Aftermath\n\nAlthough he was stopped at K\u0151szeg and failed to conquer Vienna, Suleiman additionally secured his possession in Hungary by conquering several forts, since Ferdinand and Charles evaded an open field battle. Immediately after the Ottoman withdrawal, Ferdinand reoccupied devastated territory in Austria and Hungary. Nevertheless, Suleiman concluded a peace treaty with Ferdinand in 1533, in Constantinople. The treaty confirmed the right of John Z\u00e1polya as a king of all Hungary, but recognised Ferdinand's possession of that part of the country that enjoyed the status quo. Also the Austrian archiduke was considered equal to the Ottoman Grand Vizier.\n\nThis treaty did not satisfy Z\u00e1polya or Ferdinand, whose armies began to skirmish along the borders. After Z\u00e1polya's death in 1540, Suleiman annexed Hungary to the Ottoman realm. Although from 1529 to 1566 the borders of the Ottoman Empire moved further west, none of the campaigns after 1529 achieved the decisive victory that would secure the new Ottoman possessions.","h_score":1839405.96875,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":30940778,"revid":1169074671,"description":"A siege of K\u0151szeg (German: G\u00fcns) in the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary in 1532","categories":["1532 in Europe","1532 in the Ottoman Empire","Battles involving Habsburg Croatia","Battles of the Ottoman\u2013Hungarian Wars","Conflicts in 1532","Hundred Years' Croatian\u2013Ottoman War","Sieges involving Hungary","Sieges involving the Ottoman Empire","Suleiman the Magnificent"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Defiant Stand: The Siege of G\u00fcns Halts an Empire\n\nIn 1532, a scrappy Austrian garrison at G\u00fcns repelled a massive Ottoman assault, showcasing ingenuity against overwhelming odds.

Eichelberger took two officers with him from I Corps: Byers and Colonel Frank S. Bowen, his G-3. The Eighth Army assumed control of operations on Leyte Island from Sixth Army on 26 December, the day after MacArthur and Krueger announced that organized resistance there had ended. The troops there included Eichelberger's old command, the 77th Infantry Division. In two months, Sixth Army had killed over 55,000 Japanese soldiers on Leyte, and estimated that only 5,000 remained alive on the island. By 8 May 1945, the Eighth Army had killed over 24,000 more.\n\nIn January, the Eighth Army entered combat on Luzon, landing Major General Charles P. Hall's XI Corps on 29 January near San Antonio and Major General Joseph M. Swing's 11th Airborne Division at Nasugbu, Batangas two days later. Combining with Sixth Army, the Eighth Army enveloped Manila in a great pincer movement. Eichelberger assumed personal command of the operation, which involved an advance on Manila by the lightly equipped 11th Airborne Division. The audacious advance made rapid progress until it was halted by well-prepared positions on the outskirts of Manila. MacArthur awarded Eichelberger another Silver Star.\n\nEighth Army's final operation of the war was that of clearing out the southern Philippines, including the major island of Mindanao, an effort that occupied the soldiers of the Eighth Army for the rest of the war. In six weeks, the Eighth Army conducted 14 major and 24 minor amphibious operations, clearing Mindoro, Marinduque, Panay, Negros, Cebu, and Bohol. In August 1945, Eichelberger's Eighth Army became part of the Occupation of Japan.

He then released a statement to the public, condemning the Ku Klux Klan as a violent group and stating that responsibility for the disorder \"rests squarely\" on Klan leaders. Other white observers\u2014both locally and nationally\u2014had mixed feelings about responsibility, expressing sympathy for the Lumbees' actions but suggesting that Cole's First Amendment rights may have been violated. Mayor Oxendine received telegrams, letters, and phone calls of approval from Native and non-indigenous Americans from around the United States. Alabama Governor Jim Folsom issued a statement reading, \"The white man has mistreated the Indian for 400 years. This is one time I'm glad to see and hope the Indians continue to beat the paleface.\"\n\nThe day after the failed rally, large North Carolinian newspapers such as The News and Observer and The Charlotte Observer ran stories on the clash. Most were favorable to the Lumbees and portrayed the Klansmen as antagonists. Initial reports in state and national newspapers were melodramatic and portrayed the Lumbees using stereotypes associated with Western Plains Indians. The Santa Fe New Mexican misidentified the Lumbees as part of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. The local media in Robeson County did not publish on Sundays, thus it was not until later in the week that the Scottish Chief and The Robesonian released their reporting. Their stories covered the affair and preceding events in detail and avoided the use of caricatures, treating the Lumbees as they did other community residents. On January 23 the Scottish Chief issued an editorial titled \"Setting the Record Straight,\" which criticized the national sensationalism, saying, \"all too frequently news mediums are searching for a colorful angle to a story and in doing so stretch or add to the facts.\"\n\nLocal editorials sided with the Lumbees, framing the clash as a conflict between locals and outsiders, though the editorial board of The Robesonian downplayed local discontent with segregation, proclaiming there was \"no racial rift\" between Native Americans and whites in Robeson County.

The Anti-Defamation League reported that the affair \"sent a ripple of laughter clear across the country.\" Reflecting on the national praise for the Lumbees' actions at Hayes Pond in contrast to the muted response to the armed black resistance to the KKK in Monroe in 1957, Robert Williams wrote, \"The national press played up the Indian-Klan fight because they didn't consider this a great threat\u2014the Indians are a tiny minority and people could laugh at the incident as a sentimental joke\u2014but no one wanted Negroes to get the impression that this was an accepted way to deal with the Klan.\"\n\n","h_score":1763525.0875000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":2644584,"revid":1169602777,"description":"1958 armed confrontation near Maxton, North Carolina, US","categories":["1958 in North Carolina","1958 riots","January 1958 events in the United States","Ku Klux Klan crimes","Ku Klux Klan in North Carolina","Lumbee","Native American history of North Carolina","Race riots in the United States","Riots and civil disorder in North Carolina","Robeson County, North Carolina"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Lumbee Clash with Klan at Hayes Pond\n\nIn 1958, Lumbee Native Americans confronted Ku Klux Klan members at Hayes Pond in North Carolina, disrupting a rally.

It was first observed in 1968 by Cameron and Angela Kepler while they were conducting observations on two Puerto Rican endemic birds, the Puerto Rican amazon and the Puerto Rican tody. On May 18, 1971, a specimen was captured in El Yunque National Forest, which at the time was believed to be its only location. A year later, Cameron Kepler and Kenneth Parkes described the species and named it Dendroica angelae, making it the most recently-discovered New World warbler. It is the first species described in the Caribbean since 1927 and the first Puerto Rican species described in the 20th century. Although the species was initially placed in the genus Dendroica, phylogenetic studies in 2010 using mitochondrial DNA sequences from New World warblers led to a revision of warbler genera. As a result, the study's authors recommended subsuming the genus Dendroica into the genus Setophaga. The same studies showed that the elfin woods warbler is most closely related to the arrowhead warbler, which is endemic to Jamaica, and the plumbeous warbler, which is endemic to the islands of Dominica and Guadeloupe. In 2011, the American Ornithologists' Union reorganized the classification of the family Parulidae and transferred species in Dendroica to Setophaga. This revised classification was subsequently adopted by the International Ornithologists' Union.\n\nThe genus name is a combination of the Ancient Greek words ses, meaning \"moth\", and phagos, meaning \"eating\". The specific name, angelae, is a tribute to Angela Kepler. Elfin-woods warbler is an alternative spelling, and Reinita de Bosque Enano is the Spanish name.\n\n ## Description\n\nThe elfin woods warbler is a small passerine, averaging 12.5 cm (5 in) in length and 8.4 g (0.30 oz) in weight. Its upperparts are predominantly black with white areas, and its underparts are white with black streaks. Other identifying characteristics are dark brown eyes, white patches on its ears and neck, an incomplete white eyering, a white eyestripe, and two white spots on its outer tail feathers. Like other Antillean warblers (Adelaide's warbler, Saint Lucia warbler, plumbeous warbler, and arrowhead warbler), it has a long bill and short, round wings (53.8 mm or 2.12 in average). Among Setophaga species, only Adelaide's warbler has a shorter average wing length. Juveniles differ from adults, retaining a grayish-green back for approximately a year and partially molting from July to October.\n\n ### Similar species\n\nThe elfin woods warbler can be confused with the black-and-white warbler, a non-breeding visitor that occurs in Puerto Rico from mid-September to early May. The main physical distinction between the two is in the face. The elfin woods warbler has an incomplete white , while the black-and-white warbler has a bold white above the eye, and the lower half of a white eye-ring. The elfin woods warbler has an entirely black while the black-and-white warbler's is bisected by a white stripe. The latter species tends to forage on larger branches, while the elfin woods warbler forages in the canopy and on smaller branch tips.\n\n ### Voice\n\nThe elfin woods warbler's song and call are difficult to hear. The species has a subtle voice and its call and song resemble those of the bananaquit, the most abundant bird in Puerto Rico. The song is a series of \"short, rapidly uttered, rather unmusical notes on one pitch, swelling in volume and terminating with a short series of distinct double syllables sounding slightly lower in pitch\" while the call has been described as \"a single, short, metallic chip\".\n\n ## Behavior\n\n ### Breeding\n\nThe elfin woods warbler breeds from March to June. Both parents are involved in the construction of the nest and in feeding the chicks. Nests are built close to the tree trunk within dry aerial leaf litter, usually Cecropia leaves (a material used by no other Parulidae species), in Bulbophyllum wadsworthii trees. Nests are well-concealed and located 1.3 to 7.6 meters (4.3 to 24.9 ft) above ground level. In 2003 a nest with four chicks was found inside a tree stump of Colorado tree, Cyrilla racemiflora, at Maricao. The nest was at about 15 feet above ground level, with little cover in a secondary forest area. Nests are cup-shaped and made from small roots and twigs, dry leaves of Chusquea abietifolia and B. wadsworthii, and dry Panicum maximum leaves. The interior is made from fibers of C. abietifolia, dry leaves and other plant matter. Females lay two or three white eggs with red-brown spots. The chick's diet consists of insects\u2014parents have been observed offering lepidopteran and orthopteran adults and lepidopteran larvae to hatchlings.\n\n ### Feeding\n\nThe elfin woods warbler is commonly found foraging the middle canopy for insects. While searching for food it often flocks with other birds, such as black-and-white warblers, Puerto Rican tanagers and Lesser Antillean pewees. Three maneuvers used for catching prey\u2014gleaning, sally-hovering and probing\u2014have been described. Gleaning is described as a hunting maneuver made by a standing or moving bird.

Precise calculations about the number who actually died in these camps are difficult to make. Newsweek reporter Roy Gutman claimed that US State Department officials, along with representatives of other Western governments, told him that 4,000\u20135,000 people, the vast majority of them non-Serbs, perished at Omarska. Journalist Bill Berkeley puts the death toll at 2,000. A member of the United Nations (UN) Commission of Experts testified during the trial of Du\u0161ko Tadi\u0107 at the ICTY that their number was in the thousands, but she could not be precise, despite the fact that Serbian officials confirmed there were no large scale releases of prisoners sent there. A member of the Crisis Committee, Simo Drlja\u010da, who served as chief of police for Prijedor, has stated that there were 6,000 \"informative conversations\" (meaning interrogations) in Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje, and that 1,503 non-Serbs were transferred from those three camps to Manja\u010da, leaving 4,497 unaccounted for according to Human Rights Watch. According to the Association of Camp Detainess of Prijedor 1992, between May and August 1992, around 6,000 prisoners passed through Omarska, 700 of whom were killed.\n\n ## International reaction\n\nIn early August 1992, Vulliamy, Independent Television News (ITN) reporter Penny Marshall, and Channel 4 News reporter Ian Williams gained access to the Omarska camp. Their reporting served as one of the catalysts of a UN effort to investigate war crimes committed in the conflict. The camp was closed less than a month after its exposure caused international uproar.\n\n ### 1997\u20132000 controversy\n\nBetween 1997 and 2000, there was academic and media controversy regarding the events that took place in Omarska and Trnopolje in 1992, due to claims of false reporting and \"lies\". These allegations, promoted by the state-controlled Radio Television of Serbia (RTS) and the British Living Marxism (LM) paper, prompted the ITN network to accuse the LM of libel; ITN won the case in 2000, effectively forcing the paper to close down.\n\n","h_score":1763648.1812500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":4038993,"revid":1173245575,"description":"1992 Bosnian Serb concentration camp","categories":["1992 disestablishments in Bosnia and Herzegovina","1992 establishments in Bosnia and Herzegovina","Anti-Muslim violence in Europe","Bosnian War internment camps","Bosnian genocide","Serbian concentration camps in the Yugoslav Wars","Serbian war crimes in the Bosnian War"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Omarska's Dark Legacy\n\nOmarska camp, a notorious detention site in Bosnia during the 1992 war, symbolized ethnic cleansing horrors where thousands faced torture and death.

I'm like, 'Y'all, this is music, motherfuckers.'\" DJ Premier recalled that West told him during the production \"no electro Preem, I swear no electro\". The DJ further stated, \"'Ye is still that crazy dude he's always been. He's really focused on making this album raw. So I gave him a banger and he said he wanted two more on top of that one. I'm giving him two more this week.\" West ensured that the album's recording sessions were secretive, placing sheets of paper in the studio reading \"no tweeting, no talking, no e-mailing\", and also prohibiting talking to anyone outside of the location. Pusha T recalled West's attitude in an interview for Rolling Stone, saying that \"there happened to be a leak, and I remember Kanye ranting and raving, like, 'Fuck this! We're not going to ever work there again! We're going to work in hotel rooms!\" In October 2010, West tweeted that the recording of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy had been finished.

Bob Coie, a local builder, had bought a strip of land along the tracks in 1959 and acquired a large parcel along their west side in 1982. In 1985, he convinced the town to upzone the land for commercial use with the intention of eventually building a \"pre-planned business district\" and commuter rail station there. A state study of rail corridors was completed in 1994 and the Northeast Corridor was designated as the highest-priority line for commuter service to Providence. An addendum in 1995, assuming a quick start to operations, projected that daily ridership from Wickford would be 2,869 in 2000 and 3,386 in 2020. An operations plan was released in 2001, and environmental assessment was completed in 2003.\n\nBy November 2006, the station and associated track work was expected to cost \\$43.7 million, of which \\$24.99 million would be Federal Transit Administration New Starts funding. The station received a total of \\$59 million in federal funds, including the \\$24.99 million from New Starts and \\$4.35 million in stimulus funds. In late 2009, the State of Rhode Island spent \\$3.2 million to purchase 350,000 square feet (33,000 m<sup>2<\/sup>) of land for the station and parking garage, with hopes that it could be in service in 2011.\n\nGround was broken for the new station on August 18, 2010. Primary construction work on the station platform and garage was completed on time and under budget in December 2011, and a test train was run to the station in March 2012. The station opened on April 23, 2012. A major part of the modern station is the four-story parking garage, which was modeled after the nearby Lafayette Mill. The garage includes an indoor waiting room\u2014rare in the MBTA system\u2014and a small coffee\/snack shop. An 8-foot (2.4 m)-tall bronze sculpture celebrating the history of rail service at Wickford Junction was completed in October 2015.\n\n ### Ridership\n\nRidership at Wickford Junction has been far below projections, some of which had assumed that transit-oriented development would be constructed at the station. Daily boardings were projected to reach 3,544 in 2025 according to the 1995 analysis. This was reduced to 1,669 by 2020 in the 2003 Environmental Assessment, but raised again to 3,386 by 2020 in a 2005 analysis.\n\nInitial ridership in May 2012 was 130 inbound riders per day, of whom 80 percent rode to Providence and 20 percent to Boston. Ridership increased to 150 riders per day by early June and to 175 daily by February 2014.\n\nRidership averaged 292 daily boardings in the first quarter of 2017. For the second half of 2017, the state offered free intrastate rides in an attempt to promote the under-utilized T.F. Green Airport and Wickford Junction stations. The six-month promotion was expected to cost about \\$102,000. Ridership increased by 50% within the first month of the promotion. However, a 2018 count totalled only 235 daily boardings.\n\nAs of 2017 the station only has weekday service, but planners hope to add weekend service eventually. Previous official discussions about adding weekend service to T. F. Green Airport and Wickford Junction took place in 2014.\n\n","h_score":1772188.425,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":4073331,"revid":1148002071,"description":"Railway station in North Kingstown, RI","categories":["Buildings and structures in North Kingstown, Rhode Island","Former Amtrak stations in Rhode Island","Former New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad stations","MBTA Commuter Rail stations in Rhode Island","Railway stations in the United States opened in 2012","Stations on the Northeast Corridor","Transportation buildings and structures in Washington County, Rhode Island"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Wickford Junction: A Transit Hub Reborn\n\nWickford Junction station serves as a vital BART link in California's East Bay, connecting commuters to key destinations.

(born 22 November 1933) is a Singaporean poet and academic who is regarded as one of the pioneers of English literature in Singapore.\n\nThumboo graduated in English from the University of Malaya in 1956. Although he applied for a position at the university, he was rejected as few locals held academic posts at that time. He therefore worked in the civil service for about nine years before finally joining the university, then renamed the University of Singapore, in 1966 following Singapore's independence. He received a Ph.D. from the university in 1970. Thumboo rose to the position of full professor in the Department of English Language and Literature, heading the department between 1977 and 1993. After the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University in 1980 to form the National University of Singapore (NUS), he was the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences from 1980 to 1991, NUS's longest-serving dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. Thumboo was the first Chairman and Director of the university's Centre for the Arts from 1993 to 2005, and continues to be associated with the university as an emeritus professor, a position he has held since retiring from full-time teaching in September 1997.\n\nThumboo's poetry is inspired by myth and history, and he is often dubbed Singapore's unofficial poet laureate because of his poems with nationalistic themes. A pioneer of local English literature, he compiled and edited some of the first anthologies of English poetry and fiction from Singapore and Malaysia. His own collections of poetry include Rib of Earth (1956), Ulysses by the Merlion (1979) and A Third Map (1993). His latest anthology Still Travelling, consisting of almost 50 poems, was published in 2008. Thumboo has won the National Book Development Council of Singapore Book Awards for Poetry three times, in 1978, 1980 and 1994. He has also received the inaugural S.E.A. Write Award (1979), the first Cultural Medallion for Literature (1979), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Cultural and Communication Award (Literature) (1987), and the Raja Rao Award (2002). He was conferred a Bintang Bakti Masyarakat (Public Service Star) in 1981 with an additional Bar in 1991, and the Pingat Jasa Gemilang (Meritorious Services Medal) in 2006. He conceived the first National Poetry Festival for Singapore in 2015.\n\n ## Early years\n\nEdwin Thumboo, born in Singapore on 22 November 1933, was the eldest of eight children of a Tamil Indian schoolteacher and a Teochew-Peranakan Chinese housewife from a Singaporean merchant family. He and his siblings grew up speaking English and Teochew. The family was financially comfortable; their home in Mandai was the only one in the neighbourhood with electricity. Because of his mixed parentage, as a child he was sometimes called names and marginalized. This was said to have fostered determination and self-respect in him. He completed his primary education at Pasir Panjang Primary School in 1940. During the Japanese occupation of Singapore (1942\u20131945), he helped his family by selling cakes, tending goats, and working as a salesboy. Following the war, he studied at Monk's Hill Secondary School (finishing there in 1946) and Victoria School (1948). It was at the latter place that he began writing poetry at the age of 17 years, encouraged by the senior English master Shamus Frazer. Thumboo considers Frazer his spiritual father, and later dedicated Rib of Earth (1956), his first collection of poetry published while an undergraduate, to him. At this time, Thumboo was also a member of the Youth Poetry Circle, which counted among its members other early literary pioneers of Singapore such as Goh Sin Tub and Lim Thean Soo.\n\n","h_score":1835080.8187500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":3309640,"revid":1155524565,"description":"Singaporean poet and academic (born 1933)","categories":["1933 births","Academic staff of the National University of Singapore","International Writing Program alumni","Living people","Peranakan people in Singapore","Recipients of the Bintang Bakti Masyarakat","Recipients of the Cultural Medallion for literature","Recipients of the Pingat Jasa Gemilang","S.E.A.

Over the years different theories have been suggested for its purpose, linked with a range of dates for its creation.\n\nThe Tribal Hidage could have been a tribute list created upon the instructions of an Anglo-Saxon king such as Offa of Mercia, Wulfhere of Mercia or Edwin of Northumbria \u2014 but it may have been used for different purposes at various times during its history. Cyril Hart has described it as a tribute list created for Offa, but acknowledges that no proof exists that it was compiled during his rule. Higham notes that the syntax of the text requires that a word implying 'tribute' was omitted from each line, and argues that it was \"almost certainly a tribute list\". To Higham, the large size of the West Saxon hidation indicates that there was a link between the scale of tribute and any political considerations. James Campbell has argued that if the list served any practical purpose, it implies that tributes were assessed and obtained in an organised way, and notes that, \"whatever it is, and whatever it means, it indicates a degree of orderliness, or coherence in the exercise of power...\".\n\nYorke acknowledges that the purpose of the Tribal Hidage is unknown and that it may well not be, as has been commonly argued, an overlord's tribute list. She warns against assuming that the minor peoples (of 7000 hides or less) possessed any \"means of defining themselves as a distinct gentes\". Among these, the Isle of Wight and the South Gyrwe tribes, tiny in terms of their hidages and geographically isolated from other peoples, were among the few who possessed their own royal dynasties.\n\nP. H. Sawyer argues that the values may have had a symbolic purpose and that they were intended to be an expression of the status of each kingdom and province. To Sawyer, the obscurity of some of the tribal names and the absence from the list of others points to an early date for the original text, which he describes as a \"monument to Mercian power\". The 100,000 hides assigned to Wessex may have reflected its superior status at a later date and would imply that the Tribal Hidage in its present form was written in Wessex. The very large hidage assessment for Wessex was considered to be an error by the historian J. Brownbill, but Hart maintains that the value for Wessex is correct and that it was one of several assessments designed to exact the largest possible tribute from Mercia's main rivals.\n\n","h_score":1785292.0125000002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":4140416,"revid":1167927302,"description":"List of thirty-five Anglo-Saxon tribes","categories":["Anglo-Saxon kingdoms","Mercia","Texts of Anglo-Saxon England"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the Tribal Hidage?  \nA1: It's an ancient Anglo-Saxon document listing tribes and their land assessments in hides for taxation.\n\nQ2: When was it created?  \nA2: Likely in the 7th century, during England's early medieval era, amid rising kingdoms.\n\nQ3: Where was it found?  \nA3: No original survives; copies emerged in later manuscripts, evoking shadowy Anglo-Saxon archives.\n\nQ4: What does it list?  \nA4: Tribes with hide counts, a land unit, painting a vivid map of early English territories.\n\nQ5: Why is it important?  \nA5: It reveals taxation and power structures, offering a window into Anglo-Saxon society's rhythms.\n\nQ6: How was it used?  \nA6: Probably for royal assessments, guiding tributes like a fiscal heartbeat of the realm.\n\nQ7: What debates surround it?  \nA7: Scholars argue over its exact date and purpose, adding layers to its historical intrigue.\n\nQ8: How is it studied today?  \nA8: Modern historians analyze it for insights into migration and economy, like piecing an ancient puzzle."}

Hahn dismissed the isotope with the 3.5-hour half-life as contamination, but after looking at the details of the Paris group's experiments and the decay curves, Strassmann was worried. He decided to repeat the experiment, using his more efficient method of separating radium. This time, they found what they thought was radium, which Hahn suggested resulted from two alpha decays: <sup>238<\/sup> <sub>92<\/sub>U + n \u2192 \u03b1 + <sup>235<\/sup> <sub>90<\/sub>Th \u2192 \u03b1 + <sup>235<\/sup> <sub>88<\/sub>Ra Meitner found this very hard to believe. In November, Hahn travelled to Copenhagen, where he met with Bohr and Meitner. They told him that they were very unhappy about the proposed radium isomers. On Meitner's instructions, Hahn and Strassmann began to redo the experiments, even as Fermi was collecting his Nobel Prize in Stockholm. Assisted by Clara Lieber and Irmgard Bohne, they isolated the three radium isotopes (verified by their half-lives) and used fractional crystallisation to separate them from the barium carrier by adding barium bromide crystals in four steps. Since radium precipitates preferentially in a solution of barium bromide, at each step the fraction drawn off would contain less radium than the one before. However, they found no difference between each of the fractions. In case their process was faulty in some way, they verified it with known isotopes of radium; the process was fine. On 19 December, Hahn wrote to Meitner, informing her that the radium isotopes behaved chemically like barium. Anxious to finish up before the Christmas break, Hahn and Strassmann submitted their findings to Naturwissenschaften on 22 December without waiting for Meitner to reply. Hahn understood that a \"burst\" of the atomic nuclei had occurred, but he was unsure about that interpretation. Hahn concluded the article in \"Naturwissenschaften\" with: \"As chemists... we should substitute the symbols Ba, La, Ce for Ra, Ac, Th. As 'nuclear chemists' fairly close to physics we cannot yet bring ourselves to take this step which contradicts all previous experience in physics.\" Frisch normally celebrated Christmas with Meitner in Berlin, but in 1938 she accepted an invitation from Eva von Bahr to spend it with her family at Kung\u00e4lv, and Meitner asked Frisch to join her there. Meitner received the letter from Hahn describing his chemical proof that some of the product of the bombardment of uranium with neutrons was barium. Barium had an atomic mass 40% less than uranium, and no previously known methods of radioactive decay could account for such a large difference in the mass of the nucleus.","h_score":1773308.4125000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":64011351,"revid":1173859491,"description":"1938 achievement in physics","categories":["1938 in science","December 1938 events","Nuclear chemistry","Nuclear fission","Nuclear physics","Radioactivity"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is nuclear fission?  \nA1: Nuclear fission is the dramatic splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus, releasing vast energy like a cosmic firework.  \n\nQ2: Who discovered it?  \nA2: Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, with Lise Meitner's theoretical insight, uncovered it in the late 1930s.  \n\nQ3: When and where was it first observed?  \nA3: It was discovered in Germany around 1938, building on earlier atomic experiments.  \n\nQ4: How was it detected?  \nA4: Scientists noticed unexpected lighter elements from uranium bombardment, revealing the nucleus's explosive breakup.  \n\nQ5: What experiments led to this?  \nA5: Neutron irradiation of uranium showed baffling results, prompting deeper nuclear probes.  \n\nQ6: What were the initial reactions?  \nA6: The scientific community was electrified, seeing both promise and peril in this atomic unleash.  \n\nQ7: How did it impact science and war?  \nA7: It sparked nuclear energy research and fueled the atomic bomb's development during World War II.  \n\nQ8: What is its modern relevance?  \nA8: Today, fission powers clean energy plants while posing waste and proliferation risks."}

Foraker","reference":"### Defeat for re-election In the aftermath of the Gridiron Dinner, Foraker was increasingly ostracized, both politically and socially. Unwelcome at the White House, he was excluded from patronage. Nevertheless, the Committee on Military Affairs, on which Foraker sat, went ahead and held hearings into the Brownsville matter between February and June 1907. Author John Weaver, in his 1997 book on the Brownsville case, takes note of \"Foraker's masterful presentation of fact and law\", including his cross-examination of witnesses who sought to convince the committee of the soldiers' guilt. In March 1908, the committee issued its report, by a vote of 9\u20134 endorsing the President's action. While the official minority report found the evidence inconclusive, Foraker and Connecticut senator Morgan Bulkeley signed a separate report stating that \"the weight of the testimony shows that none of the soldiers of the Twenty-fifth U.S. Infantry participated in the shooting affray\". Although he knew he had little chance of winning, Foraker challenged Taft, his fellow Cincinnatian, for the Republican nomination for president. He hoped to secure a deal whereby he would endorse Taft in exchange for support in the senatorial election to be held in January 1909. Roosevelt was determined to drive Foraker from politics, and Taft refused to deal. Taft won at each stage of the delegate-selection process, gaining all but two delegates from Ohio. At the 1908 Republican National Convention, Taft received 702 votes and was nominated; Foraker received 16, of which 11 came from blacks. After failing to capture the Republican presidential nomination, Foraker concentrated on campaigning for re-election to the Senate. His vote on the Hepburn Act and his opposition to Roosevelt had provoked opposition to him within the Ohio Republican Party; in addition, both he and Dick were seen by some as the face of the old guard of the party, out of place in the Progressive Era. Many of those who opposed him proposed Congressman Theodore E. Burton for the Senate seat; Foraker stated that the first thing to do was secure a Republican legislature, with the question of who should be senator left until victory was obtained. Amid speculation as to Taft's position on Foraker, the two men met, to all appearances cordially, on September 2 at the Grand Army of the Republic encampment at Toledo, and later that day, the two men appeared on the same platform. Taft spoke in appreciation of Foraker, who, as governor, had appointed him as a judge, giving him his start in public life. Foraker, for his part, stated that Taft would be his party leader during the campaign, and called on the presidential candidate at his headquarters in Cincinnati a week later. The Taft campaign asked Foraker to preside, and to introduce Taft, at a rally to be held at the Cincinnati Music Hall on September 22. In a letter to a newspaper publisher, Taft pointed out that Foraker \"can be useful with the colored vote and the Grand Army vote\".","h_score":1785560.8250000002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":699650,"revid":1155087594,"description":"American politician and military officer (1846\u20131917)","categories":["1846 births","1917 deaths","19th-century American judges","19th-century American politicians","20th-century American politicians","Burials at Spring Grove Cemetery","Candidates in the 1908 United States presidential election","Cornell University alumni","Judges of the Superior Court of Cincinnati","Ohio University trustees","Ohio Wesleyan University alumni","People from Highland County, Ohio","People of Ohio in the American Civil War","Politicians from Cincinnati","Republican Party United States senators from Ohio","Republican Party governors of Ohio","Union Army officers"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Joseph B.

He wrote the song when his first-grade daughter came home crying after a boy pushed her off the slide. He blurted out three reasons for the incident to comfort her: the boy liked her, people can be strange, and it's \"human nature\". He recorded a rough demo of the song in their studio while the Toto song \"Africa\" was being mixed. Fellow Toto keyboardist David Paich added some synthesizer strings on top of the demo. Originally, the song was offered to Toto but they passed on it as they preferred stadium rock-oriented material. Paich had prepared some demo tracks for producer Quincy Jones to listen to as possible songs for Thriller and asked Porcaro to make Jones a tape with the songs. Running low on cassette tapes, Porcaro used the tape on which he had already recorded his \"Human Nature\" demo, putting Paich's songs on the reverse side and marking that on the label as the side that Jones should listen to. Jones listened to Paich's songs but did not think they were right for Thriller. However, he did not stop the tape when the songs finished playing, and the cassette deck playing the tape had \"auto-reverse\" capability, meaning that it started playing the other side as soon as the first side was finished. As Jones described it, \"All of a sudden, at the end, there was all this silence, there was: 'why, why, dah dah da-dum dah dah, why, why'. Just a dummy lyric and a very skeletal thing\u2014I get goosebumps talking about it. I said, 'This is where we wanna go, because it's got such a wonderful flavor'\". However, Jones was dissatisfied with the original lyrics for the verses and asked John Bettis, who had written lyrics for hits by the Carpenters and the Pointer Sisters, among others, to write new lyrics for the song. He completed the song in two days. Jones asked if the song could be included on Jackson's album, to which Porcaro and Bettis agreed. Porcaro discusses Bettis' input in \"Human Nature\": > \"At the last minute, Quincy (Jones) asked me if I\u2019d mind if John Bettis took a shot at the verse lyrics, and I said, 'No, not at all.' I didn't consider myself a great lyricist. Sometimes what just came out of my mouth when I was writing, I mean like the chorus on \"Human Nature\" could be keepers. But I was wide open. But with John Bettis, I didn't change a single syllable, he just nailed it. He turned my record into a song, with a beginning, middle and end. Those lyrics are amazing and I don't talk about that enough.\" The song, as it turns out, did not change much musically from the demo through to the final album, as Jones liked the song as it was. It was, for the most part, recreated in the studio. Even engineer Bruce Swedien asked Porcaro, who played most of the parts and helped Jackson with the vocal phrasing, to help reproduce the phrasing of the accents of the \"Why, why\" that can be heard on the demo.","h_score":1751457.58125,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":3282937,"revid":1165786851,"description":"1983 song by Michael Jackson","categories":["1980s ballads","1982 songs","1983 singles","American soft rock songs","Contemporary R&B ballads","Epic Records singles","Michael Jackson songs","Rock ballads","Song recordings produced by Quincy Jones","Songs about New York City","Songs with lyrics by John Bettis","Songs written by Steve Porcaro"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is \"Human Nature\"?  \nA1: It's a soulful ballad from Michael Jackson's 1982 album Thriller, exploring emotional vulnerability.\n\nQ2: Who wrote the song?  \nA2: Steve Porcaro of Toto wrote it, with Michael Jackson adding his magical touch.\n\nQ3: When was it released?  \nA3: In 1982, as part of the groundbreaking Thriller era.\n\nQ4: What themes does it cover?  \nA4: It delves into longing and human connection, like a gentle whisper of the heart.\n\nQ5: How does it fit Jackson's style?  \nA5: Blending pop and R&B, it showcases his smooth vocals and emotional depth.\n\nQ6: What makes its melody memorable?  \nA6: The synth-driven tune flows like a dream, hooking listeners with its rhythmic allure.\n\nQ7: How was it received?  \nA7: Critics praised its intimacy, becoming a fan favorite for its timeless appeal.\n\nQ8: What's its lasting legacy?  \nA8: It highlights Jackson's artistry, inspiring covers and evoking universal human experiences."}

She also became a member of the supergroup G Girls, with whom she released two singles (\"Call the Police\" and \"Milk and Honey\"). In early 2017, Inna was announced as a coach on Vocea Rom\u00e2niei Junior with Andra and Marius Moga, and in the May of the same year her YouTube channel surpassed two billion total views. The singer's fifth studio album, Nirvana, was released in December 2017. Singles featured on the record included \"Gimme Gimme\" (2017), \"Ruleta\" (2017) and \"Nirvana\" (2017), which attained commercial success in several European countries including Romania and Turkey. \"Ruleta\" and \"Nirvana\" peaked at numbers three and two in her native country, respectively. Another pair of top ten singles in Romania, \"Nota de plat\u0103\" and \"Pentru c\u0103\", followed in late 2017 and 2018 with Moldovan group the Motans. Inna released her sixth studio album, Yo, in May 2019. Containing songs written solely in Spanish, Inna took entire creative control over the record and worked extensively with Romanian producer David Ciente. She described Yo's material as experimental and gypsy-influenced, a departure from her previous work. \"Ra\" was released as the record's lead single in September 2018. It was promoted by several public appearances in Mexico and the United States\u2014including the 2018 Telehit Awards and 19th Annual Latin Grammy Awards\u2014as well as by Inna's inclusion in magazines such as Rolling Stone and Vogue M\u00e9xico y Latinoam\u00e9rica. The singer also signed a record deal with Jay-Z's record label Roc Nation. \"Iguana\", her follow-up single, went on to reach number four in Romania. In August, Inna launched her digital magazine titled InnaMag. The non-album release \"Bebe\" with Ugandan artist Vinka peaked at number one on the native Airplay 100 in March 2020, and was the first in a string of singles that sonically returned to a more EDM sound but also encompassed deep house influences. As of 2020, Inna has been a juror for Pro TV's The Masked Singer Romania show. The singer released her seventh studio album, Heartbreaker, on 27 November 2020, which she created during a three-week period with Romanian songwriters and producers such as Sebastian Barac, Marcel Botezan, Ciente and Alexandru Cotoi at a mansion from which she uploaded daily YouTube vlogs to document the progress made; the vlogs constituted the first season of Inna's Dance Queen's House series. In January 2021, Inna's single \"Read My Lips\" (2020) featuring Colombian singer Farina reached number ten in Romania, and by May, Heartbreaker's lead single \"Flashbacks\" had peaked at number one in Russia and within the top ten in Romania, Ukraine, Bulgaria and the Commonwealth of Independent States. \"Cool Me Down\" with Gromee, and \"It Don't Matter\" with Alok and Sofi Tukker also became hits in selected territories. Inna participated as Alok's special guest at the Untold Festival in September 2021, held at Cluj Arena. ### 2021\u2013present: Champagne Problems and Just Dance\n\nIn October 2021, Inna released the non-album single \"Up\", whose chart success in countries such as Bulgaria, Poland and Russia peaked in early 2022. The track, eventually receiving a remix with Jamaican rapper Sean Paul, also became Inna's fifth number-one in Romania, topping Uniunea Produc\u0103torilor de Fonograme din Rom\u00e2nia's (UPFR) airplay ranking.

The brown thrasher is abundant throughout the eastern and central United States and southern and central Canada, and it is the only thrasher to live primarily east of the Rockies and central Texas. It is the state bird of Georgia.\n\nAs a member of the genus Toxostoma, the bird is relatively large-sized among the other thrashers. It has brown upper parts with a white under part with dark streaks. Because of this, it is often confused with the smaller wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), among other species. The brown thrasher is noted for having over 1000 song types, and the largest song repertoire of birds. However, each note is usually repeated in two or three phrases.\n\nThe brown thrasher is an omnivore, with its diet ranging from insects to fruits and nuts. The usual nesting areas are shrubs, small trees, or at times on ground level. Brown thrashers are generally inconspicuous but territorial birds, especially when defending their nests, and will attack species as large as humans.\n\n ## Taxonomy and naming\n\nThe brown thrasher was originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae as Turdus rufus. The genus name Toxostoma comes from the Ancient Greek toxon, \"bow\" or \"arch\" and stoma, \"mouth\". The specific rufum is Latin for \"red\", but covers a wider range of hues than the English term.\n\nAlthough not in the thrush family, this bird is sometimes erroneously called the brown thrush. The name misconception could be because the word thrasher is believed to derive from the word thrush. The naturalist Mark Catesby called it the fox-coloured thrush.\n\nGenetic studies have found that the brown thrasher is most closely related to the long-billed and Cozumel thrashers (T. longirostre & guttatum), within the genus Toxostoma.\n\n","h_score":1826470.7312500002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":33731262,"revid":1170470307,"description":"Species of bird","categories":["Birds described in 1758","Birds of Canada","Native birds of the Canadian Prairies","Native birds of the Eastern United States","Native birds of the Plains-Midwest (United States)","Symbols of Georgia (U.S. state)","Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus","Thrashers","Toxostoma"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Brown Thrasher: Nature's Sneaky Serenader\n\nThis unassuming bird, with its streaked brown feathers and bold personality, masters an array of mimicry that rivals any pop star.

Following preparations in Japan, 3 RAR arrived in Pusan on 28 September 1950 and was attached to the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade. The initial invasion of South Korea by the North Korean People's Army (NKPA) had been broken by General Douglas MacArthur's amphibious landing at Inchon, and so, in what was a complicated war of manoeuvre, 3 RAR was involved in the pursuit of the NKPA back across the 38th parallel. On 21 October 1950, 3 RAR took part in the Battle of Yongyu in an apple orchard north of Pyongyang, the first large-scale engagement fought by a battalion of the regiment. The farthest north 3 RAR would advance into North Korea was the Pakchon\u2013Chongju area following the Battle of Chongju, and it was near here that Lieutenant Colonel Charlie Green, the battalion's commanding officer, was mortally wounded on 30 October 1950. By November 1950, following the Chinese intervention, 3 RAR was withdrawing south along with the rest of the allied Eighth Army, fighting the Battle of Pakchon. However, following a UN counteroffensive a defensive line was established about 45 kilometres (28 mi) north of Seoul and it was here in April 1951 that 3 RAR, along with the 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry and supporting UN forces, fought a successful defensive action at the Battle of Kapyong. This battle proved to be the climactic point of the regiment's first year in Korea. By June 1951, 3 RAR moved to a position on the Imjin River under the command of the US I Corps and it was here that the battalion would spend the next two years of the war. The major action fought by the regiment in the second half of 1951 was the Battle of Maryang San, where 3 RAR, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Frank Hassett, assaulted Hill 317 on 5 October 1951. Known as Operation Commando, Hill 317 was captured after five days of hard fighting. Following this action the war was defined by fixed defences of trenches, bunkers and wire, constant patrolling, and numerous clashes. In April 1952, 3 RAR was joined by 1 RAR and command of the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade, of which they were now a part, passed to an Australian officer as a result. Meanwhile, the expansion of the commitment in Korea to two battalions resulted in the establishment of a regimental depot at Ingleburn in 1952 to train and hold infantrymen for service in Korea. In April 1953, 1 RAR was replaced by 2 RAR on a system of unit rotation. During this changeover a parade was held to mark the first occasion that all battalions of the regiment had been on parade together. 1 RAR served a year in Korea, 2 RAR for four months before the armistice, while 3 RAR served throughout the war, earning itself the nickname of \"Old Faithful\". The last major action of the war for the regiment was the Battle of the Samichon River fought by 2 RAR over 24\u201326 July 1953, repulsing a number of major Chinese assaults just hours before the Armistice Agreement was signed. Following the armistice both sides withdrew and a demilitarised zone was created. The period that followed proved uneventful, yet the UN forces were required to maintain combat readiness and the ability to react quickly in case the North Koreans violated the ceasefire. In April 1954, 2 RAR returned to Australia and was replaced by 1 RAR which remained in South Korea until March 1956. 3 RAR finally returned to Australia in September 1954 after four years of continuous service in Korea and five years before that in Japan. Total Army casualties in Korea included 293 killed, 1,210 wounded and 23 captured, the majority being infantrymen of the Royal Australian Regiment. The fighting in Korea provided the regiment with valuable combat experience, establishing a foundation for its further development and marking the emergence of the Australian Regular Army. The Korean War remains the only large-scale, conventional war that the regiment has fought. During this time the Army developed the capability to maintain two battalions on major operations at the same time.","h_score":1819477.9625000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":977549,"revid":1164538181,"description":"Administrative regiment for regular infantry battalions of the Australian Army","categories":["1948 establishments in Australia","Australian army units with royal patronage","Infantry regiments of Australia","Military units and formations established in 1948","Regiments of the Korean War","Royal Australian Regiment"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the Royal Australian Regiment?  \nA1: It is an infantry regiment in the Australian Army.

The advertising campaign was built around the slogans 'Led Zeppelin \u2013 The Only Way to Fly' and 'Led Zeppelin II Now Flying'. In the United States, some commercially duplicated reel-to-reel copies of Led Zeppelin II made by Ampex bore the title Led Zeppelin II \u2013 The Only Way to Fly on their spine. Commercially, Led Zeppelin II was the band's first album to hit No. 1 in the US, knocking The Beatles' Abbey Road (1969) twice from the top spot, where it remained for seven weeks. By April 1970 it had registered three million American sales, whilst in Britain it enjoyed a 138-week residence on the LP chart, climbing to the top spot in February 1970. Meanwhile, the album reached the top spot in other 5 national albums charts (including Canadian, Australian and Spanish albums charts). In November Ritchie Yorke reported in Billboard that while the album had achieved \"staggering\" sales, as a hard rock record it was considered unsuitable for North American Top 40 radio stations, who were \"dreary and detached from the mainstream of contemporary rock music\". The album also yielded Led Zeppelin's biggest hit, \"Whole Lotta Love\". This song reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in January 1970, after Atlantic went against the group's wishes by releasing a shorter version on 45. The single's B-side, \"Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)\", also hit the Billboard chart, peaking at No. 65 in April 1970. The album helped establish Led Zeppelin as an international concert attraction, and for the next year, the group continued to tour relentlessly, initially performing in clubs and ballrooms, then in larger auditoriums and eventually stadiums as their popularity grew. Led Zeppelin II was not well-received by contemporary music critics. John Mendelsohn wrote a negative review of the record for Rolling Stone, in which he mocked the group's heavy sound and white blues, while writing that \"until you've listened to the album eight hundred times, as I have, it seems as if it's just one especially heavy song extended over the space of two whole sides\". In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau jokingly referred to the band as \"the best of the wah-wah mannerist groups, so dirty they drool on demand\", while complaining that \"all the songs sound alike\", before assigning the album a \"B\" grade. He nonetheless conceded in 1970 that \"Led Zeppelin simply out-heavied everyone\" the previous year, \"pitting Jimmy Page's repeated low-register fuzz riffs against the untiring freak intensity of Robert Plant's vocal. This trademark has only emerged clearly on the second album, and more and more I am coming to understand it as an artistic triumph.\" On 10 November 1969, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America and in 1990 it was certified 5\u00d7 platinum reflecting shipping of five million copies. By 14 November 1999, Led Zeppelin II had shipped twelve million copies and was certified 12\u00d7 platinum by the RIAA. The 2014 reissue of the album helped itself get back into the Billboard Top 10 when it got to .","h_score":1811169.1500000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":50239,"revid":1172425629,"description":null,"categories":["1969 albums","Albums involved in plagiarism controversies","Albums produced by Jimmy Page","Albums recorded at A&M Studios","Albums recorded at Morgan Sound Studios","Albums recorded at Olympic Sound Studios","Albums recorded at Sunset Sound Recorders","Atlantic Records albums","Led Zeppelin albums"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Led Zeppelin II: Rock's Electrifying Masterpiece\n\nLed Zeppelin II, released in 1969, catapulted the band to global fame with its raw energy and innovative blend of blues and hard rock.

Scott Hamilton, who was replaced at NBC by Lipinski, Weir, and Gannon, called them a \"phenomenon\" and \"such a breath of fresh air\". GQ called their commentating style \"a Gladwell-ian ability to demystify figure skating for the uninitiated and an extreme candor for which they've caught some heat\". Cosmopolitan considered Lipinski and Weir's commentating style honest and colorful, and noted that they used banter and avoided what the magazine called \"fluffy, polished performances\". They tried to present figure skating in an accessible way to their viewers, keeping the more technical aspects of the sport to a minimum but emphasizing its \"gossipy nuances\". Sports writer and media critic Bill Goodykoontz named their enthusiasm for figure skating their \"calling card\". In Dick Button's opinion, Lipinski and Weir were \"excellent\", but that Lipinski \"might talk a little too much\", although Tom Weir stated that when skaters were \"elegant and error-free\", both Lipinski and Weir had \"the good sense to stay silent\". Goodykoontz pointed out that Lipinski and Weir were uncharacteristically quiet during the short program of Kamila Valieva, representing the Russian Olympic Committee, who was allowed to compete despite failing a drug test prior to the 2022 Winter Olympics. They chose to simply announce Valieva's jumps and express their opinions that she should not have been allowed to compete afterwards instead. In 2018 and 2019, Lipinski and Weir hosted and appeared in a few shows on Food Network, including two seasons of Wedding Cake Challenge. In 2022, Lipinski co-hosted Wedding Talk with event planner Jos\u00e9 Rol\u00f3n and wedding designer Jove Meyer, produced by Chicken Soup for the Soul Studios. In the same year, Lipinski and her husband, Todd Kapostasy, a sports producer and documentary director, co-produced Meddling: The Olympic Skating Scandal That Shocked the World, a four-part documentary series focusing on the skating controversy at the 2002 Winter Olympics, which was aired on the NBC streaming service Peacock in January 2022. Lipinski, who called the series \"a deep and responsible look at what happened\", said that she and Kapostasy chose to create the series because it was the 20th anniversary of the scandal and there had been no comprehensive look at what happened. They interviewed people in Russia, France, and Canada who were involved in the scandal.

Worthy and Berinthia, complains Collier, are allowed to enact their wiles against the Lovelesses' married virtue without being punished or losing face. The subplot is an even worse offence against religion and morality, as it positively rewards vice, allowing the trickster hero Tom to keep the girl, her dowry, and his own bad character to the end. Vanbrugh failed to take Short View seriously and published a joking reply, but Collier's censure was to colour the perception of the play for centuries. While it remained a popular stage piece through the 18th century, much praised and enjoyed for its wit, attitudes to its casual sexual morality became increasingly ambivalent as public opinion became ever more restrictive in this area, and more at odds with the permissive ethos of Restoration comedy. From 1777 Vanbrugh's original was replaced on the stage by Sheridan's A Trip to Scarborough, a close adaptation but with some \"covering\", as the prologue explains, drawn over Vanbrugh's \"too bare\" wit: As change thus circulates throughout the nation, Some plays may justly call for alteration; At least to draw some slender covering o'er, That graceless wit which was too bare before. Sheridan does not allow Loveless and Berinthia to consummate their relationship, and he withdraws approval from Amanda's admirer Worthy by renaming him \"Townly\". Some frank quips are silently deleted, and the matchmaker Coupler with the lecherous interest in Tom becomes decorous Mrs Coupler. A small-scale but notable loss is of much of the graphic language of Hoyden's nurse, who is earthy in Vanbrugh's original, genteel in Sheridan. However, Sheridan had an appreciation of Vanbrugh's style, and retained most of the original text unaltered.","h_score":1760807.70625,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":216855,"revid":1097524186,"description":"1696 Restoration comedy written by John Vanbrugh","categories":["1696 plays","Adultery in plays","Plays by John Vanbrugh","Plays set in the 17th century","Restoration comedy","Sequel plays"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Relapse: A Shadow in Recovery\n\nRelapse is the unexpected return of symptoms in conditions like addiction or illness, underscoring the fragility of progress.

At the time, the film rights were owned by Michael Laughlin, who gave up his option from Tribune Media Services after he was unsuccessful in pitching Dick Tracy to Hollywood studios. Floyd Mutrux and Art Linson purchased the film rights from the Tribune in 1977, and, in 1980, United Artists became interested in financing\/distributing Dick Tracy. Tom Mankiewicz was under negotiations to write the script, based on his previous success with Superman (1978) and Superman II (1980). The deal fell through when Chester Gould, creator of the Dick Tracy comic strip, insisted on strict financial and artistic control. That same year, Mutrux and Linson eventually took the property to Paramount Pictures, who began developing screenplays, offered Steven Spielberg the director's position, and brought in Universal Pictures to co-finance. Universal put John Landis forward as a candidate for director, courted Clint Eastwood for the title role, and commissioned Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr. to write the screenplay. \"Before we were brought on, there were several failed scripts at Universal,\" reflected Epps, \"then it went dormant, but John Landis was interested in Dick Tracy, and he brought us in to write it.\" Cash and Epps' simple orders from Landis were to write the script in a 1930s pulp magazine atmosphere and center it with Alphonse \"Big Boy\" Caprice as the primary villain. For research, Epps read every Dick Tracy comic strip from 1930 to 1957. The writers wrote two drafts for Landis; Max Allan Collins, then-writer of the Dick Tracy comic strip, remembers reading one of them. \"It was terrible. The only positive thing about it was a thirties setting and lots of great villains, but the story was paper-thin and it was uncomfortably campy.\" In addition to Beatty and Eastwood, other actors who were considered for the lead role included Harrison Ford, Richard Gere, Tom Selleck, and Mel Gibson. Landis left Dick Tracy following the controversial on-set accident on Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983), in which three actors were killed. Walter Hill then came on board to direct with Joel Silver as producer. Cash and Epps wrote another draft, and Hill approached Warren Beatty for the title role. Pre-production had progressed as far as set building, but the film was stalled when artistic control issues arose with Beatty, a fan of the Dick Tracy comic strip. Hill wanted to make the film violent and realistic, while Beatty envisioned a stylized homage to the 1930s comic strip. The actor also reportedly wanted \\$5 million plus fifteen percent of the box office gross, a deal which Universal refused to accept. Hill and Beatty left the film, which Paramount began developing as a lower-budget project with Richard Benjamin directing. Cash and Epps continued to rewrite the script, but Universal was unsatisfied. The film rights eventually reverted to Tribune Media Services in 1985. However, Beatty decided to option the Dick Tracy rights himself for \\$3 million, along with the Cash\/Epps script.","h_score":1849969.7750000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":725984,"revid":1171553346,"description":"1990 action crime film directed by Warren Beatty","categories":["1990 action comedy films","1990 films","1990s American films","1990s English-language films","1990s crime action films","1990s crime comedy films","1990s police procedural films","American action comedy films","American crime action films","American crime comedy films","Dick Tracy films","Films based on comic strips","Films directed by Warren Beatty","Films produced by Warren Beatty","Films scored by Danny Elfman","Films set around New Year","Films set in 1938","Films set in the 1930s","Films shot in Los Angeles","Films that won the Academy Award for Best Makeup","Films that won the Best Original Song Academy Award","Films whose art director won the Best Art Direction Academy Award","Films with screenplays by Bo Goldman","Live-action films based on comics","Mafia comedy films","Touchstone Pictures films"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Dick Tracy?  \nA1: Dick Tracy is a 1990 American film based on the comic strip character.

Although it was eventually fixed, the bug became the subject of controversy and Sinclair was forced to replace some of the ZX81s sold to early customers. On a more positive note, Vickers' work on the manual was received favourably, being described in 1983 as \"one of the classic texts on BASIC\". Max Phillips commented in a What Micro? retrospective: > It does a reasonable job and sensibly provides lots for the reader to do. It's quite honest about the [ZX81]'s shortcomings and provides hints and tips for ways round them ... Best of all, the manual is complete and comprehensive. There's some fairly advanced and often undisclosed information in there. The beginner won't understand it for a long time but if he or she learns some more advanced ideas, the manual is ready for them. The task of designing the ZX81's case again fell to Rick Dickinson, who produced an updated version of the ZX80's wedge-shaped case. This time round, the design team were able to use injection moulding, which enabled them to deliver a higher-quality case. Dickinson originally envisaged the ZX81 as \"an expandable range of boxes following a vaguely modular approach with a common width\", though this approach was eventually dropped. From start to finish, the design process took about six months. The ZX81 was launched on 5 March 1981 in two versions (though with identical components) \u2013 a pre-assembled machine or a cheaper kit version, which the user could assemble himself. Both versions were manufactured in Dundee, Scotland by Timex Corporation at the company's Dryburgh factory. Timex had not been an obvious choice of manufacturing subcontractor, as the company had little previous experience in assembling electronics. It was a well-established manufacturer of mechanical watches but was facing a crisis at the beginning of the 1980s. Profits had dwindled to virtually zero as the market for mechanical watches stagnated in the face of competition from the digital and quartz watches. Recognising the trend, Timex's director, Fred Olsen, determined that the company would diversify into other areas of business. This shift by Timex came at an ideal time for Sinclair. The ZX80 had proved more popular than expected and Sinclair's existing manufacturer, a small electronics company in St Ives, lacked the resources to deal with the demand. Timex took over production of the ZX80 late in 1980. The arrangement worked well for both companies and Timex took on the manufacture of the ZX81, aided by capital investment in its Dundee plant. Sinclair initially planned to produce 10,000 ZX81s a month, rising to 30,000 a month within a year. However, Timex initially had significant problems in producing enough ZX81s to satisfy demand. As a consequence, it took up to nine weeks for ZX81s to be delivered by mail order.","h_score":1778073.03125,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":34475,"revid":1171112341,"description":"Inexpensive home computer by Sinclair Research, 1981","categories":["1980s in Dundee","1981 establishments in Scotland","Computer-related introductions in 1981","Computers designed in the United Kingdom","Economic history of Scotland","Economy of Dundee","Goods manufactured in Scotland","Home computers","Products and services discontinued in 1984","Products introduced in 1981","Timex Group","Z80-based home computers","ZX81"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the ZX81?  \nA1: The ZX81 is a pioneering 1980s home computer that made tech accessible to everyday folks.\n\nQ2: When was it released?  \nA2: It launched in 1981, igniting a wave of affordable computing excitement.\n\nQ3: Who created it?  \nA3: Sinclair Research, led by visionary Sir Clive Sinclair, designed this compact marvel.\n\nQ4: What were its key features?  \nA4: It boasted a Z80 processor, 1KB RAM, and simple BASIC programming for budding coders.\n\nQ5: How popular was it?  \nA5: It sold millions worldwide, drawing in hobbyists and sparking a computing craze.\n\nQ6: What impact did it have?  \nA6: The ZX81 democratized technology, inspiring a generation of programmers and innovators.\n\nQ7: Were there notable games or software?  \nA7: Classics like 3D Monster Maze showcased its potential for creative, early digital adventures.\n\nQ8: What's its legacy today?  \nA8: It's celebrated as a retro icon, fueling nostalgia and appreciation for computing's humble roots."}

The highway was approved by the Bureau of Public Roads, the predecessor to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), on August 24, 1956, and was initially referred to as Segment \\#516. After the passage of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, which initiated the Interstate system, a public meeting was held on May 15, 1957, that identified proposed Interstate Highways and bypass routes around Nashville, including I-440. The route numbering was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials on November 12, 1958. The Tennessee Department of Highways, the predecessor to the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT), was first authorized to begin studies related to right-of-way acquisition on July 12, 1961, by the FHWA, and preliminary engineering work began in 1964. Planners chose to construct the route through both residential neighborhoods and in the location of a portion of the Tennessee Central Railway. The highway department was authorized to make right-of-way acquisitions for the section located between I-65 and I-24 on December 4, 1968, and the section between I-40 and I-65 on August 17, 1970.\n\nThe project experienced many setbacks and was subject to much controversy. After the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) became law in 1970, the FHWA determined in January 1971 that the I-440 project did not require an environmental impact statement, since it was already in the right-of-way acquisition phase, and gave final approval of the project's design. A lawsuit was filed by the National Wildlife Federation in 1973, which resulted in the requirement of an environmental impact study for I-440. The draft environmental impact statement was completed in 1978, and was approved by the FHWA on June 19 of that year. Approval of the final environmental impact statement occurred on September 19, 1980, and on February 20, 1981, TDOT was approved to begin advertising bids for construction of I-440.\n\nThe construction of I-440 required the demolition of many houses, and many Nashville residents opposed the project. Throughout the 1970s, many groups campaigned to stop the construction of the highway. Many residents of the areas near I-440 wanted TDOT to choose an alternative, such as constructing the route further to the south, widening existing surface streets, or adding more public transportation. However, traffic studies determined that the highway was necessary to relieve congestion on I-40. On December 9, 1980, a group of community activists known as the \"Nashvillians Against I-440\" filed a lawsuit, which named then-U.S. Secretary of Transportation Andrew L. Lewis Jr. as the defendant, in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee hoping to stop construction of the Interstate. The lawsuit was dismissed on September 23, 1981, when a judge ruled that the project would not adversely affect the natural environment and that TDOT had followed all necessary procedures.\n\n","h_score":1832748.8250000002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":3338930,"revid":1169433102,"description":"Highway in Nashville, Tennessee, United States","categories":["Auxiliary Interstate Highways","Beltways in the United States","Interstate 40","Interstate Highways in Tennessee","Parkways in the United States","Transportation in Davidson County, Tennessee","Transportation in Nashville, Tennessee"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Nashville's Whirling Ribbon: Interstate 440's Wild Ride\n\nInterstate 440 loops around Nashville, Tennessee, serving as a vital bypass for commuters and freight.

In 2000, an intoxicated Valo nearly jumped off the thirteenth floor of a hotel in Germany, before being pulled back by friends. In November 2004, the New York Post ran an article where Valo was accused of performing drunk at HIM's Irving Plaza concert. Valo reportedly threw half empty beer cans across the stage in addition to slurring his words and forgetting the lyrics to songs. In 2005, Valo's drink was spiked in Minneapolis. He suffered minor injuries and was robbed of his jacket, asthma medicine, cigarettes, credit cards, and cell phone. In February 2006, Valo was arrested at his home in Helsinki after allegedly threatening to kill his neighbor and resisting arrest. He later elaborated on the incident, stating: \"It was a guy just talking a lot of bull about me and my fianc\u00e9e. And I got pissed off, I went to his door, I kicked the door, he opened the door and I told him that if he was ever gonna talk badly about me and my girl, he was gonna end up being dead, and I punched him in the face, and that's the whole thing.\"\n\nDuring the making of HIM's 2007 album Venus Doom, Valo's alcohol abuse worsened to the point where he was vomiting and defecating blood. He eventually suffered a nervous breakdown. Despite a momentary recovery, Valo began drinking again during the mixing process. Eventually he was admitted to the Promises Rehabilitation Clinic in Malibu by HIM's manager Seppo Vesterinen. Valo later cited depression and stress as contributing factors to his alcohol abuse at the time. On HIM's 2010 album Screamworks: Love in Theory and Practice, Valo worked completely sober for the first time in the band's history. He has since relapsed though he has maintained an effort to balance his drinking. In 2013, Valo stated: \"I'm an on and off guy. If I drink, I drink properly for long stretches of time. And if I don't drink, I don't drink at all.\" In 2017, Valo stated that he consumes alcohol only once a month. In 2023, Valo stated that he abstains from drinking while on tour and that he had quit smoking years earlier.\n\n","h_score":1785094.9937500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":157058,"revid":1173378080,"description":"Finnish singer","categories":["1976 births","20th-century Finnish male singers","21st-century Finnish male singers","English-language singers from Finland","Finnish baritones","Finnish heavy metal singers","Finnish male singer-songwriters","Finnish male voice actors","Finnish people of Hungarian descent","Finnish rock musicians","Finnish singer-songwriters","HIM (Finnish band) members","Living people","Singers from Helsinki","Singers with a five-octave vocal range"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Ville Valo: The Velvet-Voiced Shadow King\n\nFinnish musician Ville Valo, famed for fronting the gothic rock band HIM, has mesmerized fans with his brooding lyrics and romantic metal anthems since the 1990s.

Compiled with the assistance of Jill Norman, it consists of David's selections from her essays and articles published since 1949.\n\nThe article from which the book takes its title is an essay on \"the almost primitive and elemental meal evoked by the words: 'Let's just have an omelette and a glass of wine.'\" Among the other subjects are profiles of people including Norman Douglas, Marcel Boulestin, Mrs Beeton, and \"A gourmet in Edwardian London\", Colonel Nathaniel Newnham-Davis. Several sections are devoted to descriptions of the markets of French country towns, and unpretentious restaurants and hotels in France. There are articles on lemons, potted meat, mayonnaise, pizza, syllabubs, truffles, and on the cuisines of Spain and Morocco. For most of the articles David provided either an introduction or an afternote, or both.\n\nDavid had intended to publish a second such volume, and eight years after the author's death, Norman, her literary executor, published a sequel, Is There a Nutmeg in the House? (2000). Like its predecessor, it was drawn from magazine articles, essays and other earlier writings, to which Norman added articles written by David in the 1980s. The first section of the book is a short autobiographical piece, a rarity from David, who guarded her privacy carefully. David's interest in the historical aspects of cuisine is given scope in essays on the history of Oxo and Bovril, Alexis Soyer and the potato. Articles aimed at the domestic cook include \"Do not Despair over Rice\", \"Making Ice Cream\", and one propounding a view for which she was famous: \"Garlic Presses are Utterly Useless\".

It was detected by the Galileo Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) from its absorption feature near the wavelength 4.2 micrometers. The surface pressure is estimated to be 7.5 picobar (0.75 \u03bcPa) and particle density 4 cm<sup>\u22123<\/sup>. Because such a thin atmosphere would be lost in only about 4 years (see atmospheric escape), it must be constantly replenished, possibly by slow sublimation of carbon dioxide ice from Callisto's icy crust, which would be compatible with the sublimation\u2013degradation hypothesis for the formation of the surface knobs.\n\nCallisto's ionosphere was first detected during Galileo flybys; its high electron density of 7\u201317 cm<sup>\u22123<\/sup> cannot be explained by the photoionization of the atmospheric carbon dioxide alone. Hence, it is suspected that the atmosphere of Callisto is actually dominated by molecular oxygen (in amounts 10\u2013100 times greater than CO\n<sub>2<\/sub>). However, oxygen has not yet been directly detected in the atmosphere of Callisto. Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) placed an upper limit on its possible concentration in the atmosphere, based on lack of detection, which is still compatible with the ionospheric measurements. At the same time, HST was able to detect condensed oxygen trapped on the surface of Callisto.\n\nAtomic hydrogen has also been detected in Callisto's atmosphere via recent analysis of 2001 Hubble Space Telescope data. Spectral images taken on 15 and 24 December 2001 were re-examined, revealing a faint signal of scattered light that indicates a hydrogen corona. The observed brightness from the scattered sunlight in Callisto's hydrogen corona is approximately two times larger when the leading hemisphere is observed. This asymmetry may originate from a different hydrogen abundance in both leading and trailing hemispheres. However, this hemispheric difference in Callisto's hydrogen corona brightness is likely to originate from the extinction of the signal in the Earth's geocorona, which is greater when the trailing hemisphere is observed.\n\nCallisto's atmosphere have been modelled to gain better understanding of impact of collisional molecular interactions. Researchers used a kinetic method to model collisions between the constituent elements of Callisto's atmosphere (carbon dioxide, molecular oxygen, and molecular hydrogen). The modeling took into account the thermal desorption of these compounds due to solar exposure and the resulting variations in temperature on the surface. The simulation showed that the density of Callisto's atmosphere can be explained by the trapping of hydrogen by the heavier gases, carbon dioxide and oxygen. The model shows how kinetic interactions between molecules affect the atmosphere, although it has limitations in terms of variables considered. The simulated densities correlate with expected thresholds for experimental detection.\n\n","h_score":1851622.375,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":43126,"revid":1171314071,"description":"Second largest moon of Jupiter","categories":["Astronomical objects discovered in 1610","Callisto (moon)","Discoveries by Galileo Galilei","Moons of Jupiter","Moons with a prograde orbit"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Jupiter's Ancient Ice Moon: Unraveling Callisto's Secrets\n\nCallisto, Jupiter's second-largest moon, features a heavily cratered surface that offers a frozen snapshot of the early solar system.

MD 355 passes to the west of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission headquarters and heads past the North Bethesda station along the Red Line. The road comes to an intersection with Old Georgetown Road as well as a grade-separated interchange at Montrose Parkway. The Metro Red Line tunnel draws farther east from MD 355 before it crosses into Rockville, the county seat of Montgomery County. In Rockville, the road passes more commercial development with the Metro Red Line and CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision railroad line paralleling the road a short distance to the east. The route intersects MD 911 (First Street) and Wootton Parkway. MD 355 intersects MD 660 (Dodge Street), which is a short connector to MD 28 (Veirs Mill Road) that the route intersects a short distance later. Past this intersection, MD 355 continues into downtown Rockville, where it becomes Hungerford Drive. The road passes by the Rockville station, which is used by the Metro's Red Line, MARC's Brunswick Line, and Amtrak's Capitol Limited (MARC and Amtrak trains run along the CSX line). MD 355 heads into more commercial areas and passes the Rockville Campus of Montgomery College before intersecting Gude Drive. Past this intersection, MD 355 becomes Frederick Road and heads northwest into a mix of commercial and residential areas in Derwood, drawing further away from the railroad tracks. The route leaves Rockville and intersects Shady Grove Road. Past Shady Grove Road, MD 355 has an interchange with I-370 and crosses into Gaithersburg. Here, the road heads through more commercial areas before heading into residential neighborhoods. It heads into business areas again and passes northeast of Gaithersburg High School as it approaches downtown Gaithersburg, where the route has an interchange with MD 117 (Diamond Avenue) and passes over CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision before continuing northwest past more businesses.

Traditionally, when at war the Romans would raise two legions, each of 4,200 infantry \u2013 this could be increased to 5,000 in some circumstances, or, rarely, even more. \u2013 and 300 cavalry. Approximately 1,200 of the infantry \u2013 poorer or younger men unable to afford the armour and equipment of a standard legionary \u2013 served as javelin-armed skirmishers known as velites; they each carried several javelins, which would be thrown from a distance, a short sword and a 90-centimetre (3 ft) shield. The balance were equipped as heavy infantry, with body armour, a large shield and short thrusting swords. They were divided into three ranks, of which the front rank, known as hastati, also carried two javelins; the second and third ranks, known as principes and triari respectively, had a thrusting spear instead. Both legionary sub-units and individual legionaries fought in relatively open order.\n\nIt was the long-standing Roman procedure to elect two men each year as senior magistrates, known as consuls, who in time of war would each lead an army. An army was usually formed by combining a Roman legion with a similarly sized and equipped legion provided by their Latin allies; allied legions usually had a larger attached complement of cavalry than Roman ones. By this stage of the war, Roman armies were generally larger, typically consisting of four legions, two Roman and two provided by its allies, for a total of approximately 20,000 men. The Roman army which invaded Africa consisted of four legions, each of the Roman pair reinforced to an unprecedented 6,200 infantry and with a more usual 300 cavalry each. Modern historians estimate the army to have totalled 25,000\u201330,000 men, including perhaps 2,500 cavalry.\n\n #### Carthaginian\n\nCarthaginian citizens only served in their army if there was a direct threat to the city of Carthage. When they did they fought as well-armoured heavy infantry armed with long thrusting spears, although they were notoriously ill-trained and ill-disciplined. In most circumstances Carthage recruited foreigners to make up its army. Many were from North Africa and these were frequently referred to as \"Libyans\". The region provided several types of fighters, including: close order infantry equipped with large shields, helmets, short swords and long thrusting spears; javelin-armed light infantry skirmishers; close order shock cavalry (also known as \"heavy cavalry\") carrying spears; and light cavalry skirmishers who threw javelins from a distance and avoided close combat. (The latter were usually Numidians.) The close order African infantry and the citizen-militia both fought in a tightly packed formation known as a phalanx. On occasion some of the infantry would wear captured Roman armour. As well both Iberia and Gaul provided experienced but unarmoured infantry who would charge ferociously, but had a reputation for breaking off if a combat was protracted. Slingers were frequently recruited from the Balearic Islands.\n\n #### Battles\n\nPitched battles were usually preceded by the two armies camping 2\u201312 kilometres (1\u20137 mi) apart for days or weeks; sometimes forming up in battle order each day. If either commander felt at a disadvantage, they might march off without engaging. In such circumstances it was difficult to force a battle if either of the commanders was unwilling to fight. Forming up in battle order was a complicated and premeditated affair, which took several hours. Infantry were usually positioned in the centre of the battle line, with light infantry skirmishers to their front and cavalry on each flank.\n\n","h_score":1751854.8062500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":7987808,"revid":1170374276,"description":"203 BC battle in the Second Punic War","categories":["200s BC conflicts","203 BC","Battles involving Numidia","Battles involving the Roman Republic","Battles of the Second Punic War","Kingdom of Numidia","Military history of Tunisia"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the Battle of the Great Plains?  \nA1: It was a key battle in the Second Punic War in 203 BC.  \n\nQ2: Where did it occur?  \nA2: In North Africa, near Carthage.  \n\nQ3: Who fought in it?  \nA3: Romans versus Carthaginians.  \n\nQ4: Who led the armies?  \nA4: Scipio led Romans; Hasdrubal led Carthaginians.  \n\nQ5: What caused the battle?  \nA5: It stemmed from ongoing Roman-Carthaginian rivalry.  \n\nQ6: How did it unfold?  \nA6: Romans used superior tactics to outmaneuver foes.  \n\nQ7: What was the outcome?  \nA7: Romans won, weakening Carthage significantly.  \n\nQ8: Why was it significant?  \nA8: It helped Rome win the war overall."}

This wide array of ecological niches has allowed a great biodiversity to evolve. Few other North American national parks have recorded as many vascular plant species as have been documented in North Cascades National Park. With 1,630 species documented, experts estimate adding non-vascular plants and fungi could more than double the number of known plant species. The park contains an estimated 236,000 acres (960 km<sup>2<\/sup>) of old-growth forests. As little of the park was previously logged, significant stands of old growth forest can be found in the valleys and lower slopes up to the timberline at 7,000 ft (2,100 m). From the lowest valley floors to about 2,000 ft (610 m), virgin stands of western hemlock, red cedar and Douglas fir are common. These species are heavily dependent on deep soils, and red cedars 1,000 years old and over 200 ft (61 m) tall can be found on Big Beaver Creek. These lowest elevation forests can be accessed by trails, such as the Happy Creek Forest Walk off State Route 20, the Shadows of the Sentinels at Baker Lake, Thunder Creek Trail at Diablo Lake and the Horseshoe Bend Trail from State Route 542. In openings in the forest canopy, red alder and bigleaf maple can be found but throughout this dense forest, ferns, shrubs and mosses abound. Between 2,000 and 5,500 ft (610 and 1,680 m) the forest is dominated by the pacific silver fir tree near State Route 20 at Rainy Pass. Also at this elevation, the western hemlock is replaced by the mountain hemlock as a dominant species. At elevations between 4,000 and 7,000 ft (1,200 and 2,100 m) in the subalpine zone, the forest gives way to meadows dominated by grasses and flowering plants and shrubs. Above 7,000 ft (2,100 m) lies the alpine zone where few plant species survive aside from some sparse grasses, the occasional shrub and lichens. A warming climate has led to an altitude adjustment for many flora species, with the timberline reaching 415 ft (126 m) further up the mountain slopes since the 1960s. The biodiversity of the area is threatened by climate change and invasive exotic plant species. These plants have spread across the park through the inadvertent redistribution from human activities, attaching themselves to cars and hikers. Invasive plants include the diffuse knapweed and reed canary grass. True grass species number nearly 150 in the park; half of those are considered exotic and nonnative to the ecosystem. Whitebark pine is native to the park and grows at elevations over 5,000 ft (1,500 m) in the drier eastern region of the park. Whitebark pine is a stabilizing species for other species of high altitude flora and provides a food source for birds such as the Clark's nutcracker and mammals including red and Douglas squirrels. Scientists believe that increasing temperatures will have a negative impact on the habitat necessary to support whitebark pine, and therefore impact a wide array of other species. White pine blister rust and mountain pine beetles have devastated whitebark pine populations in many regions; as of 2018, \"28 percent of whitebark pine trees are dead, 30 percent are infected with blister rust, and 1 percent have died from mountain pine beetles.\"","h_score":1832785.9937500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":45013,"revid":1166807751,"description":"U.S. National Park located in the state of Washington","categories":["1968 establishments in Washington (state)","Archaeological sites in Washington (state)","National parks in Washington (state)","North Cascades National Park","North Cascades of Washington (state)","Parks in Chelan County, Washington","Parks in Skagit County, Washington","Parks in Whatcom County, Washington","Protected areas established in 1968"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### North Cascades National Park: A Rugged Wilderness Haven\n\nVisitors flock to North Cascades National Park for its dramatic peaks and glaciers in Washington state.

During 252 and 251 BC the Roman army avoided battle, according to Polybius because they feared the war elephants which the Carthaginians had shipped to Sicily. In 250 BC the Carthaginians attempted to recapture Panormus, but were defeated, losing most of their elephants. Contemporary accounts do not report either side's other losses, and modern historians consider later claims of 20,000\u201330,000 Carthaginian casualties improbable. Encouraged by their victory at Panormus, the Romans moved against Lilybaeum \u2013 which was the main Carthaginian base on Sicily. A large army commanded by the year's consuls Publius Claudius Pulcher and Lucius Junius Pullus besieged the city. They had rebuilt their fleet, and 200 ships blockaded the harbour. Early in the blockade, 50 Carthaginian quinqueremes gathered off the Aegates Islands, which lie 15\u201340 kilometres (9\u201325 mi) to the west of Sicily. Once there was a strong west wind, they sailed into Lilybaeum before the Romans could react. They unloaded reinforcements \u2013 either 10,000 or 4,000 according to different ancient sources \u2013 and a large quantity of supplies. They evaded the Romans by leaving at night, evacuating the Carthaginian cavalry. The Romans sealed off the landward approach to Lilybaeum with earth and timber camps and walls. They made repeated attempts to block the harbour entrance with a heavy timber boom, but due to the prevailing sea conditions they were unsuccessful. The Carthaginian garrison was kept supplied by blockade runners. These were light and manoeuvrable quinqueremes with highly trained crews and pilots who knew the shoals and currents of the difficult waters. Chief among the blockade runners was a galley captained by Hannibal the Rhodian, who taunted the Romans with the superiority of his vessel and crew. Eventually, the Romans captured Hannibal and his well-constructed galley. In 250 BC an additional 10,000 oarsmen were allocated to the Roman fleet. Pulcher, the senior consul, supported by a council of war, believed these gave him sufficient advantage to risk an attack on the Carthaginian fleet at Drepana, 25 kilometres (16 mi) north of Lilybaeum along the west coast of Sicily. The Roman fleet sailed on a moonless night to avoid detection and ensure surprise. The Romans had a tradition of divining the likely fortune of a military endeavour by observing the actions of the sacred chickens. In the early morning they would be offered food: if they ate eagerly, the omens were good; if they refused it, the action was ill-fated. When the solemn ceremony was performed on the way to Drepana, the chickens declined to eat.

He is partnered with a French Resistance fighter, Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour, who escaped from France after her resistance group was compromised and killed. They pose as a married couple and grow close, despite agreeing that in their line of work feelings can get people killed. Marianne, who is trusted by the Germans, secures Max an invitation to the party where they plan to conduct the assassination. On the day itself, they have sex inside a car in the middle of a desert sandstorm, knowing they might not survive. However, the mission is successful and they escape. Max asks Marianne to come with him to London and be his wife. They marry, settle down in Hampstead, and have a baby girl, Anna, who is born during a bombing raid. A year later in 1944, Max learns from the Special Operations Executive that Marianne is suspected of being a German spy, having adopted her identity after the real Marianne was killed in France, and that the German ambassador they assassinated was a dissident Hitler wanted dead. To test their suspicions, SOE run a \"blue dye\" operation: Max is ordered to write down a piece of false intelligence at home, where Marianne can find it. If the information is picked up from intercepted German transmissions, Max must personally execute her, and if he is found to be an accomplice he will be hanged for high treason. He is told to otherwise act normally and not conduct his own investigation. Defiant, Max visits Guy Sangster, a former colleague who knew Marianne; however, Sangster, blinded in the war, cannot confirm her identity. He reveals that resistance fighter Paul Delamare, who worked with Marianne in France, is still alive in Dieppe and could identify her. Max finds a young pilot, Adam Hunter, gives him a photograph with a \"classified\" note\u2014asking if the woman in the photo is Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour\u2014and instructs him to obtain a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer from Delamare. Max and Marianne host a house party. His commanding officer, Frank Heslop, comes and tells him that Hunter was killed while waiting on the ground for the answer from Delamare and berates him for his insubordination. Max wonders if what he was told about Marianne is a test of his loyalty as part of a promotion to V-Section. The next evening, Max takes the place of a Lysander pilot and flies to France to meet Delamare, who is being held at the local police station. Max and the local resistance break into the town's jail, but Delamare is drunk and unconvincingly verifies the picture. The delay gives the French police officer room to alert the Germans, whom Max and the resistance manage to defeat. Prior to leaving, Delamare tells Max that Marianne was a talented pianist who had once played La Marseillaise in defiance of the occupying Germans in the early stages of the war. Back in England, Max takes Marianne to a local pub and demands she play the piano. She cannot. She admits she is a spy and forwarded the \"blue dye\" message, which Max left in plain view. She insists her feelings for Max are genuine, and that she was forced back into being a spy because German agents were threatening Anna. Max, unwilling to kill her, tells her they must flee the country. He kills Marianne's German handlers, a nanny and a jeweller. They drive to a local airbase, but Max cannot get the plane to start before Heslop and the military police arrive. He tries to plead his case before the officers, but Marianne tells him that she loves him, asks him to take care of Anna, then shoots herself. Heslop orders the soldiers present to report that Max executed Marianne as per his orders, so that Max will not be punished. After the war, Max moves to a ranch in Alberta to raise Anna. ## Cast\n\n ## Production\n\n ### Development and pre-production\n\nIn February 2015, it was announced that Robert Zemeckis was to direct the film, then only known as an untitled World War II romantic thriller, in which Brad Pitt would star. Steven Knight wrote the original screenplay. It had been a story he had first heard when he was 21 and had travelled with his girlfriend to Texas to visit her family. Her aunt told him the story of how her brother had fallen for a French woman who would become pregnant with his child and how he brought her to the United States where she gave birth. It was discovered she was a German spy, and, on orders from his superiors, the brother killed her. Knight had desired to make it into a film since that point. While researching for the film, he was never able to find any reference to the story, but did not rule out its accuracy. He shared the story with Pitt, and from there the production began developing. In June 2015, Marion Cotillard was cast to play a spy along with Pitt, who fall in love during a mission to kill a German official. Alan Silvestri, who has served frequently as composer for Zemeckis's films, was hired in October. In January 2016, Jared Harris joined the film, with Lizzy Caplan cast in March.\n\n","h_score":1755371.3812500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":50005608,"revid":1173858598,"description":"2016 film by Robert Zemeckis","categories":["2010s American films","2010s British films","2010s English-language films","2010s French-language films","2010s romantic thriller films","2010s spy thriller films","2016 LGBT-related films","2016 films","2016 multilingual films","2016 romantic drama films","2016 war drama films","American LGBT-related films","American World War II films","American historical romance films","American multilingual films","American romantic drama films","American romantic thriller films","American spy thriller films","American war drama films","British LGBT-related films","British World War II films","British historical romance films","British multilingual films","British romantic drama films","British romantic thriller films","British spy thriller films","British war drama films","Drama films based on actual events","Films directed by Robert Zemeckis","Films produced by Graham King","Films produced by Robert Zemeckis","Films scored by Alan Silvestri","Films set in 1942","Films set in 1943","Films set in Casablanca","Films set in France","Films set in London","Films shot at Elstree Film Studios","Films shot in London","Films shot in Morocco","Films shot in the Canary Islands","Films with screenplays by Steven Knight","GK Films films","ImageMovers films","LGBT-related films based on actual events","Lesbian-related films","Paramount Pictures films","Romance films based on actual events","Special Operations Executive in fiction","Spy films based on actual events","Spy romance films","Thriller films based on actual events","War romance films","World War II films based on actual events","World War II spy films"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the film \"Allied\" about?  \nA1: It's a 2016 WWII spy thriller about a Canadian spy and French resistance fighter who fall in love but face espionage suspicions.  \n\nQ2: Who directed \"Allied\"?  \nA2: Robert Zemeckis directed it.  \n\nQ3: Who are the main actors?  \nA3: Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard star as the leads.  \n\nQ4: When was \"Allied\" released?  \nA4: It was released in 2016.  \n\nQ5: What themes does it explore?  \nA5: The film covers love, trust, and wartime deception.  \n\nQ6: How was it received by critics?  \nA6: It received mixed reviews, praising acting but critiquing the plot.  \n\nQ7: Is it based on real events?  \nA7: It's a fictional story inspired by WWII espionage.  \n\nQ8: What is its cultural significance?  \nA8: It highlights personal conflicts in war, remembered for its stars."}

The presence of bacteria in the blood is termed bacteremia, and the presence of fungi is called fungemia. Minor damage to the skin or mucous membranes, which can occur in situations like toothbrushing or defecation, can introduce bacteria into the bloodstream, but this bacteremia is normally transient and is rarely detected in cultures because the immune system and reticuloendothelial system quickly sequester and destroy the organisms. Bacteria can enter the blood from infections such as cellulitis, UTIs and pneumonia; and infections within the vascular system, such as bacterial endocarditis or infections associated with intravenous lines, may result in a constant bacteremia. Fungemia occurs most commonly in people with poorly functioning immune systems. If bacteria or fungi are not cleared from the bloodstream, they can spread to other organs and tissues, or evoke an immune response that leads to a systemic inflammatory condition called sepsis, which can be life-threatening. When sepsis is suspected, it is necessary to draw blood cultures to identify the causative agent and provide targeted antimicrobial therapy. People who are hospitalized and have a fever, a low body temperature, a high white blood cell count or a low count of granulocytes (a category of white blood cells) commonly have cultures drawn to detect a possible bloodstream infection. Blood cultures are used to detect bloodstream infections in febrile neutropenia, a common complication of chemotherapy in which fever occurs alongside a severely low count of neutrophils (white blood cells that defend against bacterial and fungal pathogens). Bacteremia is common in some types of infections, such as meningitis, septic arthritis and epidural abscesses, so blood cultures are indicated in these conditions. In infections less strongly associated with bacteremia, blood culture may still be indicated if the individual is at high risk of acquiring an intravascular infection or if cultures cannot be promptly obtained from the main site of infection (for example, a urine culture in pyelonephritis or a sputum culture in severe community-acquired pneumonia). Blood culture can identify an underlying microbial cause in cases of endocarditis and fever of unknown origin. The pathogens most frequently identified in blood cultures include Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are also commonly encountered, although it is often unclear whether these organisms, which constitute part of the normal skin flora, are true pathogens or merely contaminants. In blood cultures taken from newborn babies and children, CNS can indicate significant infections. The epidemiology of bloodstream infections varies with time and place; for instance, Gram-positive organisms overtook Gram-negative organisms as the predominant cause of bacteremia in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s, and rates of fungemia have greatly increased in association with a growing population of people receiving immunosuppressive treatments such as chemotherapy. Gram-negative sepsis is more common in Central and South America, Eastern Europe, and Asia than in North America and Western Europe; and in Africa, Salmonella enterica is a leading cause of bacteremia. ## Procedure\n\n","h_score":1813936.6375000002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1250090,"revid":1171409196,"description":"Test to detect bloodstream infections","categories":["Blood tests","Microbiology techniques"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is a blood culture?  \nA1: A blood culture is a lab test that detects microbes in your blood, like bacteria or fungi, signaling infections.\n\nQ2: Why is it important?  \nA2: It helps diagnose bloodstream infections early, preventing serious complications and guiding treatment.\n\nQ3: How is the test performed?  \nA3: A small blood sample is drawn from a vein and placed in a special bottle to grow any microbes in a lab.\n\nQ4: When should you get one?  \nA4: It's used for fever, chills, or suspected sepsis, especially in hospitals or after surgeries.\n\nQ5: What types exist?  \nA5: There are aerobic and anaerobic cultures, plus fungal ones, each targeting different microbes.\n\nQ6: What do results mean?  \nA6: Positive results show an infection, while negative ones suggest none, but false negatives can occur if timing is off.\n\nQ7: Are there risks?  \nA7: Risks are minimal, like bruising or rare infection at the draw site, but benefits far outweigh them.\n\nQ8: How does it aid treatment?  \nA8: It identifies the exact germ, allowing targeted antibiotics and better patient outcomes in nuanced cases."}

Birkner, \"Neither man radiated the political appeal that said 'winner'.\" In 1951, more Republican politicians announced their support for Eisenhower, while Democrats continued to assure him that he could only win the presidency as a Democrat. Taft announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination on October 16. On November 17, Lodge became the campaign manager for the Draft Eisenhower movement. Sherman Adams, the Republican governor of New Hampshire, became the manager for the Draft Eisenhower movement in his state. Adams began to assemble an Eisenhower organization in late 1951. Speaking at a rally in November 1951, he exclaimed that: \"Eisenhower will have his name on the March 11 ballot, he will not withdraw his name from our presidential primary. Of that I am now certain.\" By December, the movement had grown to the point that Eisenhower had Clifford Roberts secretly organize a political advisory group of close, trusted advisors to watch the movement. Clay wrote a memorandum to Eisenhower, detailing the state of the campaign and noting the dates of the upcoming state conventions. As the momentum behind Taft's candidacy grew, Eisenhower's reluctance to run declined. He told Lodge that he considered himself a Republican, which Lodge revealed during a January 6, 1952, press conference. As Eisenhower's position on his candidacy for the New Hampshire primary remained unclear, Lodge sought help from William E. Robinson, the publisher of the New York Herald Tribune. When Robinson traveled to Europe to spend Christmas with Eisenhower, he asked him whether he would allow his name to be placed on the New Hampshire ballot; Eisenhower agreed. On January 6, 1952, authorized by Clay and Robinson, Lodge placed Eisenhower's name on the New Hampshire primary ballot. Soon, 24 newspapers, including The New York Times, endorsed Eisenhower. Senator Paul Douglas even suggested both parties to nominate Eisenhower with different vice-presidential running mates. On February 8, 1952, a Draft Eisenhower rally was scheduled to be held in Madison Square Garden. The event planners expected no more than the arena's 16,000 person capacity, but over 25,000 showed up, and the New York City police and fire marshals could get very few people to leave. On February 16, Eisenhower told Clay of his irrevocable decision to contest the presidency if nominated by the Republicans. On March 11, he won the New Hampshire primary against Taft by a margin of approximately 12 percent. He won all 14 of the state's convention delegates. Eisenhower announced he was \"astounded\" and \"moved\" by the results, and told a reporter: \"Any American who would have that many other Americans pay him that compliment would be proud or he would not be an American.\" On March 18, more than 106,000 people voted for \"Eisenhower\", \"Isenhowr\", or \"Ike\" as a write-in candidate in the Minnesota presidential primary, only 20,000 votes behind Stassen. The editor of The Kansas City Star, Roy A. Roberts, called it \"one of the biggest things that ever happened in an American political campaign\". Eisenhower asked to be relieved of his NATO assignment and retired from active service on May 31. On June 4, he made his first political speech in his hometown of Abilene, Kansas, where he also conducted a press conference. On being asked about his voting record, he said: \"In 1948, I left uniformed duty and did not register because I hoped to remain neutral. But, in 1950, I voted Republican.\" A poll conducted by Gallup days before the Republican Convention showed Eisenhower leading by 25% over Truman and 16% over Taft. The Republican National Convention nominated Eisenhower on the first ballot. To counteract the issue of his age, his advisors advised him to select 39-year-old Senator Richard Nixon as his running mate. Eisenhower and Nixon won the 1952 presidential election in a landslide, defeating Democratic nominees Adlai Stevenson and John Sparkman by a margin of 353 electoral votes.","h_score":1758215.5437500002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":3983430,"revid":1136195359,"description":"Movement advocating Eisenhower for president","categories":["1948 in American politics","1951 in American politics","1952 in American politics","Defunct American political movements","Dwight D.

A dynamite capsule was discovered in his mouth after a policeman noticed that he was chewing on something. On July 24, a police officer took Berkman for a portrait. He lent Berkman his own tie for the picture. The following day, Aronstam arrived in Pittsburgh with pockets full of dynamite to finish Berkman's botched assassination attempt. Somehow rumors of his arrival had preceded him, and he saw a newspaper headline that read \"Was Not Alone. Berkmann  [sic] Had Accomplices in His Mission of Murder. Is Aaron Stamm Here?\" Aronstam became frightened, hid the dynamite in an outhouse, and returned to New York. Most of the anarchists in Pittsburgh were questioned by police. Bauer and Nold were arrested and charged with complicity in Berkman's plot. Everywhere, anarchists took sides for or against Berkman and his attentat. The autonomists supported him, as did many anarchists across the country. Peukert spoke out in his defense. Also defending Berkman was Dyer Lum, an anarchist who had been a comrade of the Haymarket defendants, and Lucy Parsons. Among those who criticized Berkman were Jo Labadie, Benjamin Tucker, and many other anarchists who believed the anarchist struggle should be peaceful. Berkman's most prominent critic was Most, who belittled Berkman as a nuisance or a flunky hired by Frick himself to garner sympathy. Most published an article in his newspaper titled \"Reflections on Attentats\" in which he wrote that propaganda of the deed was doomed to be misunderstood in the U.S. and that it could only backfire. Most wrote that Berkman's action had proven this; while Berkman might have demonstrated a certain heroism, in all other respects his attempt was a \"total failure\". Berkman was deeply interested in the debate concerning his action. He was almost heartbroken by the rebuke from Most, who had \"preached propaganda by deed all his life\u2014now he repudiates the first attentat in this country\". He was encouraged by the words of Kropotkin, who wrote that \"Berkman has done more to spread the anarchist idea among the masses who do not read our papers than all the writings that we may publish. He has shown that there are among the anarchists, men capable of being revolted by the crimes of capitalism to the point of giving their life to put an end to these crimes, or at least to open a way to such an end.\"","h_score":1845730.4312500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":420350,"revid":1171389412,"description":"Russian-American anarchist and writer (1870\u20131936)","categories":["1870 births","1936 deaths","1936 suicides","Activists from New York City","American anarchists","American anti-capitalists","American anti-war activists","American anti\u2013World War I activists","American atheists","American expatriates in France","American failed assassins","American male non-fiction writers","American memoirists","American people convicted of attempted murder","American political writers","American revolutionaries","Anarchist theorists","Anarchist writers","Anarcho-communists","Emigrants from the Russian Empire to the United States","History of labor relations in the United States","Jewish American atheists","Jewish American writers","Jewish anarchists","Lithuanian Jews","Lithuanian anarchists","Lithuanian atheists","People convicted under the Espionage Act of 1917","People deported from the United States","People from Vilensky Uyezd","Russian anarchists","Russian anti-capitalists","Soviet emigrants to France","Stateless people","Suicides by firearm in France","Writers from Vilnius"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Alexander Berkman?  \nA1: Alexander Berkman was a fiery Russian-born anarchist who stirred up early 20th-century America like a storm in a teacup.\n\nQ2: What was his background?  \nA2: Born in 1870, he fled tsarist oppression to New York, quickly diving into radical labor circles with vivid passion.\n\nQ3: Why is he famous for an attack?  \nA3: In 1892, he attempted to assassinate steel tycoon Henry Frick, a dramatic protest against industrial brutality that landed him in prison.\n\nQ4: What did he write?  \nA4: His memoir \"Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist\" paints raw, vivid tales of incarceration, blending rebellion with unexpected humor.\n\nQ5: How did he influence anarchism?  \nA5: Berkman championed direct action and free love, weaving unexpected angles into anarchist thought like a playful rebel artist.\n\nQ6: What were his key ideas?  \nA6: He preached anti-capitalism with vivid imagery of societal chains, blending cautious critique and bold calls for revolution.\n\nQ7: Were there controversies?  \nA7: His violent tactics sparked debates, painting him as a heroic firebrand or reckless fool in the anarchist tapestry.\n\nQ8: What's his legacy today?  \nA8: Berkman's spirit echoes in modern activism, a playful yet profound reminder of radical dreams defying the status quo."}

At 00:00 UTC on October 22, Epsilon reached its peak intensity, with 1-minute sustained winds of around 115 mph (185 km\/h) and a minimum central pressure of around 952 mbar (28.11 inHg). Meanwhile, the hurricane's small and well-defined inner core was located within an environment of deep-level moisture, protecting it from dry air associated with an upper-level trough wrapping three-quarters of the way around the hurricane. Shortly afterward, Epsilon began to degrade due to a dry air intrusion, and its eye started to become ill-defined and cloud-filled, while its western eyewall eroded, causing the storm to weaken to a Category 2 hurricane. Weakening ensued throughout the day, further degrading Epsilon to a 85 mph (135 km\/h)-Category 1 hurricane before the weakening trend stopped, with the storm maintaining this intensity for about 48 hours. However, the eye briefly became better-defined, before becoming ill-defined once more just a few hours later. Meanwhile, the CDO became disorganized, with a broad outer band wrapping around the western portion of the storm. However, upper-level outflow was well-defined in the northern part of the hurricane. Around this time, Epsilon made its closest approach to Bermuda, passing just 190 miles (310 km) east of the island. At 15:00 UTC on October 23, a small eye reappeared on geostationary and polar-orbiting microwave imagery, along with increased well-defined curved banding. Concentric eyewalls began to develop within Epsilon, while the northern half of its wind field expanded, indicating the start of an eyewall replacement cycle. Several hours later, early on October 24, Epsilon completed its eyewall replacement cycle. The storm's convective pattern devolved into a large, comma-shaped structure, rather than the classical circular structure normally seen in mature tropical cyclones. During this time, Epsilon moved over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, which allowed it to retain its intensity. A buoy near the center of the hurricane indicated that Epsilon's central pressure was about 957.8 millibars (28.28 inHg) around this time, which indicated that Epsilon was a stronger hurricane than the NHC had estimated it to be earlier. Later that day, Epsilon began interacting with another upper-level trough; combined with baroclinic forcing, this caused Epsilon's wind field and inner core to expand in size. Epsilon also turned sharply northeastward and accelerated its forward motion. The hurricane slowly weakened as it continued moving further north. Early on October 25, Epsilon began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone, with the storm's cloud pattern expanding in size. The storm soon moved north of the Gulf Stream several hours later and entered much cooler waters, subsequently weakening into a tropical storm at about 18:00 UTC on the same day, even as it moved closer to another larger extratropical storm to the north, which was spawned by the upper-level trough. At 06:00 UTC on October 26, Epsilon finished transitioning into an extratropical cyclone while located about 565 miles (909 km) east of Cape Race, Newfoundland, with the storm's low-level circulation becoming stretched out along a north\u2013south axis. Later that day, Epsilon was absorbed by the larger extratropical storm to the north, at 18:00 UTC. ## Preparations and impact\n\n","h_score":1752222.8687500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":66681697,"revid":1165536351,"description":"Category 3 Atlantic hurricane in 2020","categories":["2020 Atlantic hurricane season","2020 in Bermuda","2020 in Portugal","2020 in the Caribbean","Category 3 Atlantic hurricanes","Hurricanes in Bermuda","Hurricanes in Europe","October 2020 events in Europe","October 2020 events in North America","October 2020 events in Portugal","Tropical cyclones in 2020"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What was Hurricane Epsilon?  \nA1: It was a 2020 Atlantic hurricane, the 28th named storm of an intense season.  \n\nQ2: When did it form?  \nA2: Epsilon emerged on October 19, swirling wildly in late autumn.  \n\nQ3: Where did it travel?  \nA3: It roamed the open North Atlantic, far from land's embrace.  \n\nQ4: What strength did it reach?  \nA4: Peaking as a Category 2 beast, with winds up to 110 mph.  \n\nQ5: Why was it unusual?  \nA5: As a late bloomer, it defied typical hurricane timelines with eerie grace.  \n\nQ6: Did it impact anyone?  \nA6: Mostly at sea, it stirred rough waves but spared major shores.  \n\nQ7: How does it compare to others?  \nA7: Among 2020's chaos, Epsilon was a lone wolf, less destructive yet memorable.  \n\nQ8: What lessons emerged?  \nA8: It highlighted climate's wild whims, urging vigilant storm watches ahead."}

His Azerbaijani d\u012bv\u0101n contains over four hundred ghazals (a form of love poetry) and several hundred other poems, including mas\u0331nav\u012bs (a poem written in rhyming couplets) and quatrains (a four-line poem). According to the Turkologist Kathleen Burrill, Nasimi was able to maintain the quality of his Azerbaijani language in his poetry while using the 'ar\u016bz\u0324 form (poetry using quantifying prosody). This sets him apart from later poets who relied heavily on borrowing from Persian because of what Burrill described as their \"lack of skill\" in mastering the 'ar\u016bz\u0324 form. His Persian d\u012bv\u0101n consists of almost three hundred ghazals and discusses topics such as Hurufism, praise to Twelve Imams and Imam Ali, as well as Fazlallah Astarabadi.\n\nNasimi's writing style often involves repeating sounds and grammatical patterns. His poems mainly centre around Hurufism and contain many references to Islamic texts such as the Quran. However, some of the beliefs behind his poems fall outside of mainstream Islam. Michael Hess states that Nasimi's poetry blends easily comprehensible language with more intricate themes related to Hurufism. Hess also notes that while Fuzuli's poems have remained popular due to their emotional depth and technical proficiency, the concepts behind them are not as widely understood. Burrill notes that some of Nasimi's poems can be difficult to read due to their complex religious references, when this is not the case, they convey his themes of love through \"easy-flowing, harmonious melodies\".\n\n","h_score":1787829.375,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":419980,"revid":1173549815,"description":"Azerbaijani poet (c. 1369 \u2013 c. 1419)","categories":["1369 births","1419 deaths","Arabic-language poets","Azerbaijani poets","Bektashi Order","People executed by flaying","People executed for heresy","Persian-language poets"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Imadaddin Nasimi?  \nA1: Imadaddin Nasimi was a 14th-15th century Azerbaijani poet and philosopher.\n\nQ2: Where and when did he live?  \nA2: He lived in regions of modern-day Azerbaijan, Iran, and Turkey, active around 1369-1417.\n\nQ3: What were his main works?  \nA3: Nasimi wrote mystical poetry in Persian and Azerbaijani, including divans and philosophical verses.\n\nQ4: What influenced his writing?  \nA4: He was influenced by Sufism and the Hurufi movement, blending spirituality with social critique.\n\nQ5: What themes did he explore?  \nA5: His works focused on divine love, human suffering, and the pursuit of truth through symbolic language.\n\nQ6: Why was he controversial?  \nA6: Nasimi's outspoken Hurufi ideas challenged religious orthodoxy, leading to his persecution and execution.\n\nQ7: How did he impact literature?  \nA7: He enriched Azerbaijani and Persian poetry with innovative metaphors and emotional depth.\n\nQ8: What is his legacy today?  \nA8: Nasimi is celebrated as a national hero in Azerbaijan, inspiring modern art and cultural discussions."}

Kennedy","reference":"## Selection of appointees Kennedy spent the eight weeks following his election choosing his Cabinet and other top officials. Kennedy's top priority after becoming president-elect was to craft his national security team. Kennedy believed that the establishment figures of the United States military were largely too obsessed with nuclear weapons, and too willing to utilize them. Kennedy would, ultimately, craft an administration that saw military decisions placed in the hands of a greater number of civilian figures than had been the case in Eisenhower's administration. On November 9, in announcing his first choices for his administration, Kennedy also announced that he had asked J. Edgar Hoover to remain as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Allen Dulles to remain as director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and that both had accepted his requests to remain. Some individuals declined positions in Kennedy's administration. Kennedy offered Robert A. Lovett a position in his Cabinet, but Lovett declined. Additionally, Kennedy had originally offered the position of postmaster general to Congressman William L. Dawson, who also declined. Had he accepted this offer and been confirmed to the position, Dawson would have been first black Cabinet secretary in United States history. To avoid creating a conflict of interest regarding their roles in the transition, both Clifford and Neustadt attempted to remove themselves from consideration for positions in Kennedy's administration. However, before the end of the transition Neustadt ultimately would be designated to serve as the Kennedy White House's consultant on government organization. Ahead of the election, many correspondences were sent to Kennedy and the Democratic National Committee requesting appointments to government positions. Larry O'Brien was tasked with handling the management of such correspondence. In addition, Vice President-elect Johnson and his staff sent requests of their own for individuals they wanted to see appointed. Requests coming from Johnson and his office were forwarded to Dick Donahue. On December 17, Kennedy announced the last of his ten Cabinet designees, J. Edward Day for postmaster general. John D.  Morris of The New York Times News Service noted of Kennedy's Cabinet, > It is the first to include two Jews and the first to include a brother of the President and the first in which a member lists his occupation as \"foundation executive\". Its average age is 47, making it the youngest of the twenieth century but six years older than the first Cabinet of the first President, George Washington. The age of many members of the designated Cabinet was young. The youngest designee was Robert F. Kennedy, at the age of 35. Robert F. Kennedy was to be the second-youngest United States attorney general, after only Richard Rush, who had been 33 when he assumed the office. Despite concerns about nepotism, Kennedy's father successfully demanded that Robert F. Kennedy be chosen for this position. Two of Kennedy's designees for his Cabinet would be the youngest holders of their designated Cabinet positions: Secretary of Agriculture-designate Orville Freeman (age 42) and Secretary of Defense-designate Robert McNamara (age 44). Morris noted that Eisenhower's initial Cabinet had averaged a decade older in age than Kennedy's designated Cabinet.","h_score":1794862.0375000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":66634020,"revid":1163900862,"description":"Transfer of U.S. presidential power","categories":["December 1960 events in the United States","January 1961 events in the United States","Lyndon B.

Any attempt to tile the plane with regular pentagons necessarily leaves gaps, but Johannes Kepler showed, in his 1619 work Harmonices Mundi, that these gaps can be filled using pentagrams (star polygons), decagons and related shapes. Kepler extended this tiling by five polygons and found no periodic patterns, and already conjectured that every extension would introduce a new feature hence creating an aperiodic tiling. Traces of these ideas can also be found in the work of Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Acknowledging inspiration from Kepler, Penrose found matching rules for these shapes, obtaining an aperiodic set. These matching rules can be imposed by decorations of the edges, as with the Wang tiles. Penrose's tiling can be viewed as a completion of Kepler's finite Aa pattern.\n\nPenrose subsequently reduced the number of prototiles to two, discovering the kite and dart tiling (tiling P2 below) and the rhombus tiling (tiling P3 below). The rhombus tiling was independently discovered by Robert Ammann in 1976. Penrose and John H. Conway investigated the properties of Penrose tilings, and discovered that a substitution property explained their hierarchical nature; their findings were publicized by Martin Gardner in his January 1977 \"Mathematical Games\" column in Scientific American.\n\nIn 1981, N. G. de Bruijn provided two different methods to construct Penrose tilings. De Bruijn's \"multigrid method\" obtains the Penrose tilings as the dual graphs of arrangements of five families of parallel lines. In his \"cut and project method\", Penrose tilings are obtained as two-dimensional projections from a five-dimensional cubic structure. In these approaches, the Penrose tiling is viewed as a set of points, its vertices, while the tiles are geometrical shapes obtained by connecting vertices with edges.\n\n ## Penrose tilings\n\nThe three types of Penrose tiling, P1\u2013P3, are described individually below. They have many common features: in each case, the tiles are constructed from shapes related to the pentagon (and hence to the golden ratio), but the basic tile shapes need to be supplemented by matching rules in order to tile aperiodically. These rules may be described using labeled vertices or edges, or patterns on the tile faces; alternatively, the edge profile can be modified (e.g. by indentations and protrusions) to obtain an aperiodic set of prototiles.\n\n ### Original pentagonal Penrose tiling (P1)\n\nPenrose's first tiling uses pentagons and three other shapes: a five-pointed \"star\" (a pentagram), a \"boat\" (roughly 3\/5 of a star) and a \"diamond\" (a thin rhombus). To ensure that all tilings are non-periodic, there are ' that specify how tiles may meet each other, and there are three different types of matching rule for the pentagonal tiles. Treating these three types as different prototiles gives a set of six prototiles overall. It is common to indicate the three different types of pentagonal tiles using three different colors, as in the figure above right.\n\n","h_score":1757252.3562500002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":26611936,"revid":1171179424,"description":"Non-periodic tiling of the plane","categories":["Aperiodic tilings","Discrete geometry","Golden ratio","Mathematics and art"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Penrose Tiling: The Infinite Puzzle of Patterns\n\nPenrose tiling is an aperiodic design that covers surfaces without ever repeating, challenging traditional geometry.

However, a person diagnosed with the condition may be the first in their family to have Brugada syndrome if it has arisen as a new mutation. The gene in which mutations are most commonly found in Brugada syndrome, known as SCN5A, is responsible for the cardiac sodium channel. Mutations in SCN5A associated with Brugada syndrome generally cause the flow of sodium ions to decrease. However, only 20% of cases of Brugada syndrome are associated with mutations in SCN5A, as in the majority of patients with Brugada syndrome genetic testing is unable to identify the genetic mutation responsible. Over 290 mutations in the SCN5A gene have been discovered to date, each altering sodium channel function in subtly different ways. This variation partially explains the differences in severity of the condition between different persons, ranging from a highly dangerous condition causing death at a young age to a benign condition that may not cause any problems at all. However, the genetics of Brugada syndrome are complex, and it is likely that the condition results from the interactions of many genes. Because of these complex interactions, some members of a family who carry a particular mutation may show evidence of Brugada syndrome while other carrying the same mutation may not, referred to as variable penetrance. Mutations in the SCN5A gene seem to have a prognostic value. Several other genes have been identified in association with Brugada syndrome. Some are responsible for other proteins that form part of the sodium channel, known as sodium channel \u03b2 subunits (SCN1B, SCN2B, SCN3B) while others form different types of sodium channel (SCN10A). Some genes encode ion channels that carry calcium or potassium ions (CACNA1C, CACNB2, KCND3, KCNE3, KCNJ8, KCNT1), while others generate proteins that interact with ion channels. (GPD1L, PKP2, MOG1, FGF12). Another gene associated with this condition is RRAD. The genes associated with Brugada syndrome and their description include: Some mutations associated with Brugada syndrome can also cause other heart conditions. Those who show more than one cardiac conditions at the same time caused by a single mutation are described as having an 'overlap syndrome'. An example of an overlap syndrome is Brugada and long QT syndrome (LQT3) caused by a mutation in SCN5A that reduces the peak sodium current but simultaneously leaves a persistent current leak. Brugada syndrome has been described as overlapping with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) caused by a mutation in the PKP2 gene, causing a Brugada ECG pattern but structural changes in the heart characteristic of ARVC. Another example of an overlap syndrome would be Brugada syndrome and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs) caused by a mutation in KCNT1 that leads to an abnormal gain-of-function in potassium channels of neurons and cardiomyocytes.","h_score":1755179.5062500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":155623,"revid":1173180348,"description":"Heart conduction disease","categories":["Cardiac arrhythmia","Cardiogenetic disorders","Channelopathies","Congenital disorders","Rare syndromes","Syndromes affecting the heart","Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Brugada syndrome?  \nA1: Brugada syndrome is a genetic heart disorder that disrupts electrical signals, potentially causing sudden cardiac arrest like a silent storm in the heart.\n\nQ2: Who does it affect most?  \nA2: It primarily strikes men, often with a family history, weaving through genetics like an inherited shadow.\n\nQ3: What are common symptoms?  \nA3: Symptoms include fainting, irregular heartbeats, or none at all, making it a sneaky threat that can erupt unexpectedly.\n\nQ4: What causes it?  \nA4: It's triggered by mutations in genes controlling heart rhythms, like faulty wiring in the body's electrical system.\n\nQ5: How is it diagnosed?  \nA5: Diagnosis uses an ECG to spot a unique pattern, plus family checks and genetic tests for a clearer picture.\n\nQ6: Is treatment available?  \nA6: Yes, an implantable defibrillator can zap dangers away, while avoiding triggers helps manage this rhythm rebel.\n\nQ7: What are the risks?  \nA7: Risks include sudden death from arrhythmias, so regular monitoring acts as a vital safety net against hidden hazards.\n\nQ8: How can one live with it?  \nA8: With treatment and lifestyle tweaks, many thrive normally, turning the condition into a manageable whisper rather than a roar."}

When pilots drift, they quickly gain intimate knowledge of each other's memories and feelings, and have no choice but to accept them; del Toro found this concept's dramatic potential compelling. The director expressed his intention that the empathy metaphors extend to real life: > The pilots' smaller stories actually make a bigger point, which is that we're all together in the same robot [in life] ... Either we get along or we die. I didn't want this to be a recruitment ad or anything jingoistic. The idea of the movie is just for us to trust each other, to cross over barriers of color, sex, beliefs, whatever, and just stick together. Del Toro acknowledged this message's simplicity, but said he would have liked to have seen adventure films with similar morals when he was a child. The film's ten primary characters all have \"little arcs\" conducive to this idea. Del Toro stated, \"I think that's a great message to give kids ... 'That guy you were beating the shit out of ten minutes ago? That's the guy you have to work with five minutes later.' That's life ... We can only be complete when we work together.\" The director noted that Hellboy and The Devil's Backbone told the same message, though the latter conveyed it in a very different way. The film centers on the relationship between Becket and Mori, but is not a love story in a conventional sense. Both are deeply damaged human beings who have decided to suppress their respective traumas. While learning to pilot their Jaeger, they undergo a process of \"opening up\", gaining access to each other's thoughts, memories and secrets. Their relationship is necessarily one of respect and \"perfect trust\". Hunnam commented that the film is \"a love story without a love story. It's about all of the necessary elements of love without arriving at love itself\". Both Becket and Mori have suffered profound personal tragedies; one of the script's central ideas is that two damaged people can metaphorically \"become one\", with their figurative missing pieces connecting almost like a puzzle. Del Toro emphasized the characters' emotional intimacy by filming their training fight scene the way he would a sex scene. Del Toro, a self-described pacifist, avoided what he termed \"car commercial aesthetics\" or \"army recruitment video aesthetics\", and gave the characters Western ranks including \"marshal\" and \"ranger\" rather than military ranks such as \"captain\", \"major\" or \"general\". The director stated that he \"avoided making any kind of message that says war is good. We have enough firepower in the world.\" Del Toro wanted to break from the mass death and destruction featured in contemporary blockbuster films, and made a point of showing the streets and buildings being evacuated before Kaiju attacks, ensuring that the destruction depicted is \"completely remorseless\". The director stated: > I don't want people being crushed. I want the joy that I used to get seeing Godzilla toss a tank without having to think there are guys in the tank ... What I think is you could do nothing but echo the moment you're in. There is a global anxiety about how fragile the status quo is and the safety of citizens, but in my mind\u2014honestly\u2014this film is in another realm. There is no correlation to the real world. There is no fear of a copycat Kaiju attack because a Kaiju saw it on the news and said, \"I'm going to destroy Seattle.\" In my case, I'm picking up a tradition. One that started right after World War II and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for Japan to heal the wounds of that war. And it's integral for a Kaiju to rampage in the city. Writing for the Los Angeles Review of Books, Wai Chee Dimock connected the film's central theme of togetherness to its recurring image of missing shoes, stating the \"utopian dream\" driving the characters is > that puny humans like us could be \"together\"\u2014not only in the specific neural melding that must take place between the two Jaeger co-pilots but also, more generally speaking, in a fractal web of resemblance, filling the world with copies of ourselves at varying orders of magnitude and with varying degrees of re-expression, beginning with the shoes on our feet. ## Production\n\n","h_score":1766331.3812500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":32112949,"revid":1169461257,"description":"2013 film by Guillermo del Toro","categories":["2010s American films","2010s English-language films","2010s action thriller films","2010s monster movies","2010s science fiction films","2013 3D films","2013 films","Alien invasions in films","American 3D films","American dystopian films","American monster movies","American robot films","American science fiction action films","American science fiction adventure films","Annie Award-winning films","Apocalyptic films","Brain\u2013computer interfacing in fiction","Films about orphans","Films about parallel universes","Films about technology","Films adapted into television shows","Films directed by Guillermo del Toro","Films produced by Guillermo del Toro","Films produced by Thomas Tull","Films scored by Ramin Djawadi","Films set in 2013","Films set in 2020","Films set in 2025","Films set in Alaska","Films set in Hong Kong","Films set in Manila","Films set in San Francisco","Films set in Tokyo","Films set in the 2020s","Films set in the Pacific Ocean","Films set in the future","Films shot in Toronto","Films shot in the Philippines","Films with screenplays by Guillermo del Toro","Films with screenplays by Travis Beacham","Giant monster films","IMAX films","Japan in non-Japanese culture","Kaiju films","Legendary Pictures films","Mecha films","Military of the United States in fiction","Warner Bros. films"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Pacific Rim about?  \nA1: Pacific Rim is a 2013 sci-fi film about giant monsters called Kaiju attacking Earth, and humans responding with massive robots called Jaegers.

He is the recipient of several accolades, including four Filmfare Awards. For his contributions to film, the Government of France awarded him the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (Knight of the Order of Arts and letters) in 2013.\n\nAfter writing a television serial, Kashyap got his major break as a co-writer in Ram Gopal Varma's crime drama Satya (1998) and made his directorial debut with Paanch, which never had a theatrical release due to censorship issues. He then went on to direct Black Friday (2004), a film based on the namesake book by Hussain Zaidi about the 1993 Bombay bombings. Its release was held up for two years by the District Board of Film Certification because of the pending verdict of the case at that time but was released in 2007 to widespread critical appreciation. Kashyap's follow-up, No Smoking (2007) met with negative reviews and performed poorly at the box-office. His next venture Dev.D (2009), a modern adaptation of Devdas was a critical and commercial success; followed by the socio-political drama Gulaal (2009), and the thriller That Girl in Yellow Boots (2011).\n\nKashyap's prominence increased with the two-part crime drama, Gangs of Wasseypur (2012). Kashyap subsequently co-produced the critically acclaimed drama The Lunchbox, and the biographical drama Shahid (both 2013), the former earned him a BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language nomination. His next films were the anthology Bombay Talkies (2013), and the drama Ugly (2014). In 2016, Kashyap directed Raman Raghav 2.0, a film inspired by the serial killer Raman Raghav. His next film was the sports drama Mukkabaaz, which was released in 2018. The same year, he co-directed India's first Netflix Original series, the crime thriller Sacred Games, based on Vikram Chandra's novel of the same name and the romantic drama Manmarziyaan.

As was his right as the sitting Prime Minister, Heath did not resign, hoping to persuade the Liberals into a Conservative-led coalition. He met Thorpe on 2 March to discuss possible bases for co-operation, Heath's preferred option being a formal coalition in which Thorpe would be given a cabinet post, and junior ministries would be allocated to other senior Liberals. As the combined Conservative-Liberal vote amounted to 57% of the electorate, such a government would, Heath thought, have some moral legitimacy. If Thorpe would not accept coalition, a less formal basis of inter-party co-operation might be agreed which would enable the Conservative government to retain office.\n\nThe next day, following discussions with senior colleagues, Thorpe advised Heath that a commitment to electoral reform would be a prerequisite to any arrangement between the two parties. Thorpe proposed that Heath establish a Speaker's Conference whose recommendations on electoral reform would, if acceptable to the Liberals, form the basis of subsequent legislation with full cabinet approval. Following further consultations with their parties, the two leaders met again; Heath reported that while his party would not object to a Speaker's Conference, they could not commit themselves in advance to accepting its recommendations, which would be subject to a free House of Commons vote. This was unacceptable to Thorpe, who then made a separate proposal that an all-party \"Government of national unity\" be formed to tackle the urgent economic problems facing the country. This idea was rejected by Heath, who resigned on Monday 4 March.\n\nThorpe later admitted that a coalition agreement would have torn the party apart; the more radical elements, in particular the Young Liberals, would never have accepted it. Furthermore, Thorpe said that \"even with our support Heath wouldn't have had a parliamentary majority\"; without some arrangements with the Scottish Nationalists or the Ulster Unionists, the coalition could have been brought down by the first vote on the Queen's Speech. Following Heath's resignation, Wilson formed a Labour minority government.\n\n","h_score":1771890.925,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":228564,"revid":1172483630,"description":"British politician (1929\u20132014)","categories":["1929 births","2014 deaths","20th-century British military personnel","20th-century English LGBT people","20th-century English memoirists","21st-century English LGBT people","Alumni of Trinity College, Oxford","Anti-apartheid activists","Deaths from Parkinson's disease","English LGBT politicians","English expatriates in the United States","English male non-fiction writers","LGBT members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom","Leaders of the Liberal Party (UK)","Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies","Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies","Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom","Military personnel from London","Neurological disease deaths in England","People acquitted of crimes","People educated at Eton College","People educated at Hazelwood School","People from Kensington","Presidents of the Oxford Union","UK MPs 1959\u20131964","UK MPs 1964\u20131966","UK MPs 1966\u20131970","UK MPs 1970\u20131974","UK MPs 1974","UK MPs 1974\u20131979"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Jeremy Thorpe?  \nA1: Jeremy Thorpe was a British politician and leader of the Liberal Party from 1967 to 1976.\n\nQ2: When and where was he born?  \nA2: He was born in 1929 in London, England, and died in 2014.\n\nQ3: What were his early political roles?  \nA3: Thorpe was elected as a Member of Parliament in 1959 and rose to prominence in the Liberal Party.\n\nQ4: What major policies did he advocate?  \nA4: He supported liberal reforms, including social issues and European integration during his leadership.\n\nQ5: What was the Thorpe affair?  \nA5: It involved allegations that Thorpe conspired to murder his former lover in the 1970s, leading to a high-profile trial.\n\nQ6: What was the outcome of his trial?  \nA6: Thorpe was acquitted in 1979, but the scandal damaged his reputation severely.\n\nQ7: How did the scandal impact his career?  \nA7: It forced his resignation as party leader and ended his active political involvement.\n\nQ8: What is his legacy today?  \nA8: His contributions to liberal politics are noted, but the scandal often overshadows his achievements."}

Humphrey Atkins issued a statement saying that Sands had committed suicide \"under the instructions of those who felt it useful to their cause that he should die\". More than 100,000 people lined the route of his funeral, which was conducted with full IRA military honours. Margaret Thatcher showed no sympathy for his death, telling the House of Commons that \"Mr. Sands was a convicted criminal. He chose to take his own life. It was a choice that his organisation did not allow to many of its victims\". In the two weeks following Sands' death, three more hunger strikers died. Francis Hughes died on 12 May, resulting in further rioting in nationalist areas of Northern Ireland, in particular Derry and Belfast. Following the deaths of Raymond McCreesh and Patsy O'Hara on 21 May, Tom\u00e1s \u00d3 Fiaich, by then Primate of All Ireland, criticised the British government's handling of the hunger strike. Despite this, Thatcher continued to refuse to negotiate a settlement, stating \"Faced with the failure of their discredited cause, the men of violence have chosen in recent months to play what may well be their last card\", during a visit to Belfast in late May. Nine protesting prisoners contested the general election in the Republic of Ireland in June. Kieran Doherty and Paddy Agnew (who was not on hunger strike) were elected in Cavan\u2013Monaghan and Louth respectively, and Joe McDonnell narrowly missed election in Sligo\u2013Leitrim. There were also local elections in Northern Ireland on 20 May, although Sinn F\u00e9in did not contest them. Some smaller groups and independents who supported the hunger strikers gained seats, such as the Irish Independence Party with 21 seats, while the Irish Republican Socialist Party (the INLA's political wing) and People's Democracy (a Trotskyist group) gained two seats each, and a number of pro-hunger strike independent candidates also won seats. The British government passed the Representation of the People Act 1981 to prevent another prisoner contesting the second by-election in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, which was due to take place following the death of Sands. On 4 July the prisoners stated they were not asking for preferential treatment, saying \"We would warmly welcome the introduction of the Five Demands for all prisoners\". Following the deaths of Joe McDonnell and Martin Hurson, the families of some of the hunger strikers attended a meeting on 28 July with Catholic priest Father Denis Faul. The families expressed concern at the lack of a settlement to the priest, and a decision was made to meet with Gerry Adams later that day. At the meeting Father Faul put pressure on Adams to find a way of ending the strike, and Adams agreed to ask the IRA leadership to order the men to end the hunger strike. The following day Adams held a meeting with six of the hunger strikers to outline a proposed settlement on offer from the British government should the strike be brought to an end.","h_score":1849159.65625,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":827035,"revid":1170227832,"description":"Protest by Irish republican prisoners in Northern Ireland, in which ten died","categories":["1981 Irish hunger strike","1981 in Northern Ireland","1981 protests","Hunger strikes","Irish National Liberation Army","Protests in Northern Ireland","Provisional Irish Republican Army","The Troubles (Northern Ireland)"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Hunger Strike: Ireland's Fiery Defiance in 1981\n\nIn 1981, Irish republican prisoners in Northern Ireland's Maze Prison refused food to protest their treatment, demanding political status amid the Troubles.

He sent a small retinue ahead, consisting of his eight-year-old son\u2014the Duke of York (later King James II of England)\u2014and his nephew\u2014the deposed Elector Palatine Charles Louis\u2014along with some members of the nobility and fifty men. The group were admitted into the town on 22 April, and hosted by the town's mayor and aldermen. Charles Louis told the mayor that they planned to meet the King on his way to the town the next day. Accordingly, on the next morning, Sir Lewis Dyve arrived at the gates and announced that King Charles intended to dine in the town that day. Hotham held a meeting with the town's leaders and they resolved not to allow Charles to enter Hull and secured the town gates and lifted the drawbridges. Charles approached Beverley Gate on the morning of 23 April, accompanied by many local nobles, the Earl of Montrose, the Earl of Lindsey, Prince Rupert of the Rhine and a large army from the local trained bands. The King's heralds announced his arrival and then demanded that he be allowed entry to the town and the magazine, on the basis that it was property of the Crown. Hotham stood on top of the low wall next to the gate and announced that despite his loyalty to the King, he could not allow the King and his army to enter the town without breaking the trust placed in him by Parliament. Doing so, he explained, would label him \"the odious name of villain and faith-breaker\". He offered to allow the King entry with a small escort of twelve men but when the King demanded thirty, Hotham demurred, worried that it could rouse Royalist sympathisers in the town. The two sides continued to dispute matters until the early evening, during which time Hotham agreed to provide food for the King, which he had lowered from the town walls. Frustrated, the King declared Hotham a traitor and suggested that he should be thrown from the walls by the townspeople but the declaration had no effect and the Royalists withdrew to Beverley. Parliament responded to the King's charge of treason by stating that Hotham had only been following their orders and that the King had breached Parliamentary privilege by branding Hotham a traitor. This declaration from Parliament brought Hotham to national attention; as was typical during the civil war, Parliament celebrated its victory over the King by publishing propaganda. A speech made by Hotham on 23 May, in which he justified his actions in defying Charles, was published in pamphlet form and for a time those that favoured Parliament were known as 'Hothamites'. In response, a cartoon picture was published suggesting that Hotham felt he was superior to the King: Parliament ordered the picture to be ceremonially burned. Hotham was worried about the prospect of unrest and rebellion within Hull. At the end of April, Parliament announced that should he be killed his son would replace him as governor. To try and prevent desertions, he spread rumours that the King had ordered any soldiers caught outside the city walls to be killed. By the end of May, in response to demands from Hotham that others \"share in his dangers and responsibilities\", Parliament sent Sir William Airmyn, Sir William Strickland, John Alured, Michael Warton, Henry Darley and Peregrine Pelham to Hull with Captain Hotham. During May, Parliament had also transported the majority of the weapons from Hull on four boats; around three-quarters of what had been housed in the town arrived in London on 30 May.

Fossil Mecoptera become abundant and diverse during the Cretaceous, for example in China, where panorpids such as Jurassipanorpa, hangingflies (Bittacidae and Cimbrophlebiidae), Orthophlebiidae, and Cimbrophlebiidae have been found.\n\nExtinct Mecoptera species may have been important pollinators of early gymnosperm seed plants during the late Middle Jurassic to mid\u2013Early Cretaceous periods before other pollinating groups such as the bees evolved. These were mainly wind-pollinated plants, but fossil mecopterans had siphon-feeding apparatus that could have fertilized these early gymnosperms by feeding on their nectar and pollen. The lack of iron enrichment in their fossilized probosces rules out their use for drinking blood. Eleven species have been identified from three families, Mesopsychidae, Aneuretopsychidae, and Pseudopolycentropodidae within the clade Aneuretopsychina. Their lengths range from 3 mm (0.12 in) in Parapolycentropus burmiticus to 28 mm (1.1 in) in Lichnomesopsyche gloriae. The proboscis could be as long as 10 mm (0.39 in). It has been suggested that these mecopterans transferred pollen on their mouthparts and head surfaces, as do bee flies and hoverflies today, but no such associated pollen has been found, even when the insects were finely preserved in Eocene Baltic amber. They likely pollinated plants such as Caytoniaceae, Cheirolepidiaceae, and Gnetales, which have ovulate organs that are either poorly suited for wind pollination or have structures that could support long-proboscid fluid feeding. The Aneuretopsychina were the most diverse group of mecopterans in the Latest Permian, taking the place of the Permochoristidae, to the Middle Triassic. During the Late Triassic through the Middle Jurassic, Aneuretopsychina species were gradually replaced by species from the Parachoristidae and Orthophlebiidae. Modern mecopteran families are derived from the Orthophlebiidae.\n\n ### External relationships\n\nMecoptera have special importance in the evolution of the insects. Two of the most important insect orders, Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) and Diptera (true flies), along with Trichoptera (caddisflies), probably evolved from ancestors belonging to, or strictly related to, the Mecoptera. Evidence includes anatomical and biochemical similarities as well as transitional fossils, such as Permotanyderus and Choristotanyderus, which lie between the Mecoptera and Diptera. The group was once much more widespread and diverse than it is now, with four suborders during the Mesozoic.\n\nIt is unclear as of 2020 whether the Mecoptera form a single clade, or whether the Siphonaptera (fleas) are inside that clade, so that the traditional \"Mecoptera\" taxon is paraphyletic. However the earlier suggestion that the Siphonaptera are sister to the Boreidae is not supported; instead, there is the possibility that they are sister to another Mecopteran family, the Nannochoristidae. The two possible trees are shown below:\n\n\\(a\\) Mecoptera (clades in boldface) is paraphyletic, containing Siphonaptera:\n\n\\(b\\) Mecoptera is monophyletic, sister to Siphonaptera:\n\n ### Internal relationships\n\nAll the families were formerly treated as part of a single order, Mecoptera. The relationships between the families are, however, a matter of debate. The cladogram, from Cracraft and Donoghue 2004, places the Nannochoristidae as a separate order, with the Boreidae, as the sister group to the Siphonaptera, also as its own order. The Eomeropidae is suggested to be the sister group to the rest of the Mecoptera, with the position of the Bittacidae unclear. Of those other families, the Meropeidae is the most basal, and the relationships of the rest are not completely clear.\n\n ## Biology\n\n ### Morphology\n\nMecoptera are small to medium-sized insects with long beaklike rostra, membranous wings and slender, elongated bodies. They have relatively simple mouthparts, with a long labium, long mandibles and fleshy palps, which resemble those of the more primitive true flies. Like many other insects, they possess compound eyes on the sides of their heads, and three ocelli on the top. The antennae are filiform (thread-shaped) and contain multiple segments.\n\nThe fore and hind wings are similar in shape, being long and narrow, with numerous cross-veins, and somewhat resembling those of primitive insects such as mayflies. A few genera, however, have reduced wings, or have lost them altogether. The abdomen is cylindrical with eleven segments, the first of which is fused to the metathorax. The cerci consist of one or two segments. The abdomen typically curves upwards in the male, superficially resembling the tail of a scorpion, the tip containing an enlarged structure called the genital bulb.\n\nThe caterpillar-like larvae have hard sclerotised heads with mandibles (jaws), short true legs on the thorax, prolegs on the first eight abdominal segments, and a suction disc or pair of hooks on the terminal tenth segment. The pupae have free appendages rather than being secured within a cocoon (they are exarate).\n\n ### Ecology\n\nMecopterans mostly inhabit moist environments although a few species are found in semi-desert habitats. Scorpionflies, family Panorpidae, generally live in broad-leaf woodlands with plentiful damp leaf litter. Snow scorpionflies, family Boreidae, appear in winter and are to be seen on snowfields and on moss; the larvae being able to jump like fleas. Hangingflies, family Bittacidae, occur in forests, grassland and caves with high moisture levels. They mostly breed among mosses, in leaf litter and other moist places, but their reproductive habits have been little studied, and at least one species, Nannochorista philpotti, has aquatic larvae.\n\nAdult mecopterans are mostly scavengers, feeding on decaying vegetation and the soft bodies of dead invertebrates. Panorpa raid spider webs to feed on trapped insects and even the spiders themselves, and hangingflies capture flies and moths with their specially modified legs. Some groups consume pollen, nectar, midge larvae, carrion and moss fragments. Most mecopterans live in moist environments; in hotter climates, the adults may therefore be active and visible only for short periods of the year.\n\n ### Mating behaviour\n\nVarious courtship behaviours have been observed among mecopterans, with males often emitting pheromones to attract mates. The male may provide an edible gift such as a dead insect or a brown salivary secretion to the female. Some boreids have hook-like wings which the male uses to pick up and place the female on his back while copulating. Male panorpids vibrate their wings or even stridulate while approaching a female.\n\nHangingflies (Bittacidae) provide a nuptial meal in the form of a captured insect prey, such as a caterpillar, bug, or fly. The male attracts a female with a pheromone from vesicles on his abdomen; he retracts these once a female is nearby, and presents her with the prey. While she evaluates the gift, he locates her genitalia with his. If she stays to eat the prey, his genitalia attach to hers, and the female lowers herself into an upside-down hanging position, and eats the prey while mating. Larger prey result in longer mating times. In Hylobittacus apicalis, prey 3 to 14 millimetres (0.12 to 0.55 in) long give between 1 and 17 minutes of mating. Larger males of that species give prey as big as houseflies, earning up to 29 minutes of mating, maximal sperm transfer, more oviposition, and a refractory period during which the female does not mate with other males: all of these increase the number of offspring the male is likely to have.\n\n ### Life-cycle\n\nThe female lays the eggs in close contact with moisture, and the eggs typically absorb water and increase in size after deposition. In species that live in hot conditions, the eggs may not hatch for several months, the larvae only emerging when the dry season has finished. More typically, however, they hatch after a relatively short period of time. The larvae are usually quite caterpillar-like, with short, clawed, true legs, and a number of abdominal prolegs. They have sclerotised heads with mandibulate mouthparts. Larvae possess compound eyes, which is unique among holometabolous insects. The tenth abdominal segment bears either a suction disc, or, less commonly, a pair of hooks. They generally eat vegetation or scavenge for dead insects, although some predatory larvae are known. The larva crawls into the soil or decaying wood to pupate, and does not spin a cocoon. The pupae are exarate, meaning the limbs are free of the body, and are able to move their mandibles, but are otherwise entirely nonmotile. In drier environments, they may spend several months in diapause, before emerging as adults once the conditions are more suitable.\n\n ## Interaction with humans\n\nForensic entomology makes use of scorpionflies' habit of feeding on human corpses. In areas where the family Panorpidae occurs, such as the eastern United States, these scorpionflies can be the first insects to arrive at a donated human cadaver, and remain on a corpse for one or two days. The presence of scorpionflies thus indicates that a body must be fresh.\n\nScorpionflies are sometimes described as looking \"sinister\", particularly from the male's raised \"tail\" resembling a scorpion's sting. A popular but incorrect belief is that they can sting with their tails.","h_score":1771801.3875000002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1572904,"revid":1171787024,"description":"Order of insects with markedly different larvae and adults","categories":["Extant Permian first appearances","Insect orders","Mecoptera","Paraphyletic groups"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Scorpionflies: The Enigmatic Mecoptera Order\n\nMecoptera, commonly called scorpionflies, are ancient insects with distinctive scorpion-like tails and predatory habits, fascinating scientists for their evolutionary quirks.

It was the first major conflict in South Carolina in the war, having been preceded by bloodless seizures of several military fortifications in the province.\n\nPatriot forces under the command of Major Andrew Williamson had been dispatched to the area to recover a shipment of gunpowder and ammunition intended for the Cherokee that had been seized by Loyalists.

On 1 September 1937, the first group consisting out of 11,807 Koreans were deported. Koreans had to leave their movable property behind and receive \"exchange receipts\", but these were rushed and filled out in a way that they were not considered binding legal documents. The Soviet authorities charged the deported Koreans 5 roubles for each day of their journey. Those Koreans who did not resist the resettlement were awarded with 370 roubles. The Soviet secret police, the NKVD, would go from house to house, knock on the doors, and inform the people inside that they must gather all their belongings, personal documents, and all food they can find at home in less than half an hour and follow them. They were not given prior notice where they were being deported to. By the end of September, 74,500 Koreans were evicted from Spassk, Posyet, Grodekovo, Birobidzhan and other places. In the second phase of the deportation, starting from 27 September 1937, the Soviet authorities expanded their search to encompass Koreans from Vladivostok, the Buryat Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, the Chita Oblast and Khabarovsk Kray. The deportees were transported by railway in 124 trains. During this operation, 7,000 Soviet Chinese were also deported together with Soviet Koreans. In case of mixed marriages, if the husband was Korean, the entire family was subject to deportation. Only if the husband was non-Korean and the wife Korean was the family exempt from this order. NKVD officers were allowed to stay in the abandoned houses of the Koreans. Five to six families (25 to 30 people) were sent to each compartment of a cargo train. Their journey lasted between 30 and 40 days. The sanitation inside these trains was of poor quality. Deported Koreans had to eat, cook, sleep and excrete inside these wagons. A correspondence sent by the NKVD official Nikolay Yezhov, dated 25 October 1937, indicated that the deportation was complete, having removed 36,442 Korean families. The only remaining Koreans, 700 settlers in Kamchatka and Okhotsk, were supposed to be deported by 1 November 1937. The correspondence also reveals that 2,500 Koreans were arrested during this operation; presumably, they were all shot because they protested moving out of their homes. In total, 171,781 persons were deported. They were sent on a 4,000 miles (6,400 km) journey in trains to the special settlements in the Kazakh and Uzbek SSR. At least 500 Koreans died as a direct result of this transfer. The corpses of the deportees who died from starvation were left behind at one of the many train stations. Instead of the planned seven, the Koreans were dispersed between 44 regions. 37,321 people were sent to the Tashkent region; 9,147 to the Samarkand region; 8,214 to the Fergana region; 5,799 to the Khwarazm region; 972 to the Namangan region, etc. Overall, 18,300 Korean households were deported to the Uzbek SSR, and 20,141 households to the Kazakh SSR. Some were resettled for a second time, as was the case of 570 Korean families who were evicted from the Kazakh SSR to the Astrakhan District to be given jobs in the fishing industry. Ultimately, approximately 100,000 Koreans were sent to the Kazakh SSR and more than 70,000 to Uzbek SSR. In 1940, a further number of Koreans were resettled, this time from the Murmansk region to the Altai Krai. A decree signed by the chief of the Soviet secret police Lavrentiy Beria ordered that 675 families containing 1,743 people, including Germans, Poles, Chinese and Koreans, should be removed from the border regions. On 10 January 1943, a State Defense Committee resolution stipulated that 8,000 Koreans should be demobilized from the Red Army and sent to labour battalions with other Koreans in Central Asia. Sporadic deportations of any remaining Koreans continued all until 1946. Entire districts in the Far Eastern Region were left empty. Red Army officials obtained the best buildings left behind. Even though the Soviet government planned to settle 17,100 families in their place, only 3,700 families moved there by 1939. ## Experience in exile\n\n","h_score":1839136.33125,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":2198176,"revid":1171556074,"description":"Transfer of Koreans in the Soviet Union","categories":["1937 in the Soviet Union","Anti-Korean sentiment","Deportation","Ethnic cleansing in Asia","Forced migration in the Soviet Union","Korean migration","Korea\u2013Soviet Union relations","Political repression in the Soviet Union","Racism in the Soviet Union"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What was the deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union?  \nA1: It was a forced relocation of ethnic Koreans from the Soviet Far East in the 1930s.  \n\nQ2: When did it occur?  \nA2: The main deportations happened in 1937 under Stalin's regime.  \n\nQ3: Why was it carried out?  \nA3: It stemmed from fears of Japanese espionage due to Korea's proximity and Soviet-Japanese tensions.  \n\nQ4: How many people were affected?  \nA4: Estimates suggest around 170,000 Koreans were deported.  \n\nQ5: Where were they sent?  \nA5: Most were relocated to Central Asia, like Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.  \n\nQ6: What conditions did deportees face?  \nA6: They endured harsh travel and poor living conditions in new areas.  \n\nQ7: What were the immediate impacts?  \nA7: Many suffered from disease, poverty, and cultural disruption.  \n\nQ8: How is it viewed historically?  \nA8: It's seen as a Stalinist repression, highlighting ethnic policies in the USSR."}

He initially distributed propaganda for the Social Democratic Labor Party, before affiliating with his home town's local anarcho-communist group: the Union of Poor Peasants. Despite the political climate of increased political repression against revolutionaries, the Union continued to meet weekly and inspired Makhno to devote himself to the revolution. Makhno was initially distrusted by other members of the group, due to his apparent penchant for drinking and getting into fights. But after six months in the Union of Poor Peasants, Makhno had thoroughly educated himself on the principles of libertarian communism and became a formal member.\n\nFollowing a series of agrarian reforms, which disempowered the traditional peasant communes through the creation of a wealthier land-owning class and resulted in the growth of private estates, the Union of Poor Peasants initiated a campaign of \"Black Terror\" against the large landowners and the local Tsarist police. The group carried out a series of expropriations against local businessmen, using the money they stole to print propaganda that attacked the recent reforms. Suspected of being involved in these attacks, Makhno was arrested in September 1907 but was eventually released without charges due to a lack of evidence. As the rest of the group's members had been outlawed, Makhno founded another anarchist study group in a neighboring village, where two dozen members gathered on a weekly basis to discuss anarchist theory. But after the assassination of a police informant by the Union of Poor Peasants, the police launched a crackdown against the anarchist group and arrested many of its members, including Makhno himself in August 1909.\n\n","h_score":1855088.33125,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":306428,"revid":1173452282,"description":"Ukrainian anarchist revolutionary (1888\u20131934)","categories":["1888 births","1934 deaths","19th-century Ukrainian people","19th-century atheists","20th-century Ukrainian people","20th-century atheists","20th-century deaths from tuberculosis","Anarchist theorists","Anarcho-communists","Anti-Stalinist left","Anti-imperialism in Europe","Anti-monarchists","Burials at P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery","Carpenters","Community activists","Former Russian Orthodox Christians","Guerrilla warfare theorists","Insurrectionary anarchists","Makhnovshchina","Military leaders of the Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine","People from Alexandrovsky Uyezd (Yekaterinoslav Governorate)","People from Huliaipole","People of Cossack descent","People of the Russian Civil War","People of the Russian Revolution","Prisoners and detainees of Poland","Prisoners and detainees of Russia","Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Russia","Social anarchists","Soviet anarchists","Soviet emigrants to France","Soviet emigrants to Poland","Soviet emigrants to Romania","Soviet military personnel of the Russian Civil War","Soviet people of the Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War","Tuberculosis deaths in France","Ukrainian Cossacks","Ukrainian agrarianists","Ukrainian anarchists","Ukrainian anti-capitalists","Ukrainian atheists","Ukrainian communists","Ukrainian dissidents","Ukrainian emigrants to France","Ukrainian emigrants to Romania","Ukrainian guerrillas","Ukrainian male writers","Ukrainian military leaders","Ukrainian people imprisoned abroad","Ukrainian people of the Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War","Ukrainian prisoners and detainees","Ukrainian rebels","Ukrainian refugees","Ukrainian revolutionaries","Ukrainian socialists","Ukrainian trade unionists","Ukrainian writers in Russian"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"The Anarchist Cossack: Nestor Makhno's Fiery Rebellion\n\nNestor Makhno was a Ukrainian anarchist who led a ragtag peasant army against tsars and Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War.

After solving a riddle his father has left, Yuri finds his father's token, a half of a sword. He goes to Goguryeo and meets Jumong. Yuri and Jumong match their halves of the sword, and the sword becomes one while oozing blood. When Jumong asks his son to show his power, the boy rides atop sunlight. Jumong then makes Yuri his heir. In 19 BCE, the king ascends into heaven and does not return. Yuri holds a funeral for his father, using the king's whip in place of his missing body, and becomes Goguryeo's second king. The foundation of the southwestern kingdom of Baekje is also linked to the Jumong myth. According to the Samguk sagi, when Yuri is made heir, Jumong's two sons by a local wife are excluded from the kingship. These two brothers, Biryu and Onjo, migrate south to found their own kingdoms. Biryu sets up court in an unfavorable place, while Onjo founds Baekje in good terrain in what is now southern Seoul. The former dies of shame when he learns that his brother's kingdom is flourishing, and the remnants of his people join Baekje. The myth of Jumong is of the northern type, with Haemosu as the celestial father and Yuhwa as the earthly woman. Contemporaneous Chinese sources report that Jumong and Yuhwa were both actively worshipped as gods by the Goguryeo people, including in rituals involving shamans. Like the Dangun myth, the story is also subject to euhemerized interpretations. For instance, Seo Daeseok argues that Haemosu symbolizes an ancient iron-using, agricultural sun-worshipping people, that Yuhwa was a member of a riverine group of hunters, farmers, and fishermen, and that Geumwa's polity centered on hunting and pastoralism. The Jumong myth is first attested in the fifth-century Gwanggaeto Stele, but the first-century Chinese text Lunheng describes a barbarian tale of a good archer who crosses a river on the backs of fish and turtles to found a new kingdom in the south. However, this figure's mother is a slave-girl impregnated by an egg-like energy rather than a goddess who gives birth to a physical egg, and the figure himself founds the kingdom of Buyeo, rather than that of Goguryeo. The Goguryeo foundation myth thus incorporates the myths of Haemosu and Yuri and the Buyeo foundation myth into a single narrative. #### Southern kingdoms\n\n","h_score":1840013.9125000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":328868,"revid":1169745351,"description":null,"categories":["History of Korea","History of Northeast Asia","Korean folklore","Korean mythology"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Korean mythology?  \nA1: Korean mythology consists of ancient stories and beliefs from Korea's prehistory, involving gods, heroes, and spirits.

Part of the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, the city lies in the Salt Lake Valley along the banks of the Jordan River between the 10,000-foot (3,000 m) Oquirrh Mountains and the 11,000-foot (3,400 m) Wasatch Mountains. The city has 3.5 miles (5.6 km) of the Jordan River Parkway that contains fishing ponds, trails, parks, and natural habitats. The Salt Lake County fair grounds and equestrian park, 67-acre (27 ha) Oquirrh Lake, and 37 public parks are located inside the city. As of 2020, there were 77,487 people in South Jordan.\n\nFounded in 1859 by Mormon settlers and historically an agrarian town, South Jordan has become a rapidly growing bedroom community of Salt Lake City. Kennecott Land, a land development company, has recently begun construction on the master-planned Daybreak Community for the entire western half of South Jordan, potentially doubling South Jordan's population. South Jordan was the first municipality in the world to have two temples of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Jordan River Utah Temple and Oquirrh Mountain Utah Temple), it now shares that distinction with Provo, Utah. The city has two TRAX light rail stops, as well as one commuter rail stop on the FrontRunner.\n\n ## History\n\n ### Pre-European\n\nThe first known inhabitants were members of the Desert Archaic Culture who were nomadic hunter-gatherers. From 400 A.D. to around 1350 A.D., the Fremont people settled into villages and farmed corn and squash. Changes in climatic conditions to a cooler, drier period and the movement into the area of ancestors of the Ute, Paiute, and Shoshone, led to the disappearance of the Fremont people. When European settlers arrived, there were no permanent Native American settlements in the Salt Lake Valley, but the area bordered several tribes \u2013 the territory of the Northwestern Shoshone to the north, the Timpanogots band of the Utes to the south in Utah Valley, and the Goshutes to the west in Tooele Valley.\n\nThe only recorded trapper to lead a party through the area was \u00c9tienne Provost, a French Canadian. In October 1824, Provost's party was lured into an Indian camp somewhere along the Jordan River north of Utah Lake. The people responsible for the attack were planning revenge against Provost's party for an earlier unexplained incident involving other trappers. Provost escaped, but his men were caught off-guard and fifteen of them were killed.\n\n","h_score":1787453.2625000002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":137069,"revid":1165902249,"description":"City in Salt Lake County, Utah, United States","categories":["1859 establishments in Utah Territory","Cities in Salt Lake County, Utah","Cities in Utah","Populated places established in 1859","Salt Lake City metropolitan area","South Jordan, Utah","Wasatch Front"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is South Jordan, Utah?  \nA1: South Jordan is a city in the U.S. state of Utah.

In 1699 the estates, including Steep Holm, were sold to Philip Freke of Bristol, whose descendants held it for the next 130 years. Freke's granddaughter married into the family of John Willes, who was Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas and Member of Parliament. During their ownership, probably around 1776, a new cottage was built on Steep Holm for fishermen. It was built using stones from the ruined priory. In 1830 the island was sold again, according to some sources this was to a cousin of John Freke Willes named William Willes; however, other sources suggest it was to a solicitor in Weston-super-Mare named John Baker. In 1832 the island was leased to Colonel Tynte of Halswell House, who established an inn for sailors. The inn was run by the Harris family, using rum and tobacco bought from ships. They claimed that the island was outside the jurisdiction of the excise men until a court case in 1884. After the Harris family, the inn was run by Mr W. L. Davies, who offered fishing, shooting and boating holidays. To make landing on the island easier, a new pier was built close to the inn. In 1835 clergyman John Ashley from Clevedon voluntarily ministered to the population of the island and the neighbouring Flat Holm. Ashley created the Bristol Channel Mission in order to serve seafarers on the 400 sailing vessels which used the Bristol Channel. The mission would later become the Mission to Seafarers, which still provides ministerial services to sailors in over 300 ports.","h_score":1754989.9625000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":635181,"revid":1165233647,"description":"Island in the Bristol Channel, United Kingdom","categories":["Hills of Somerset","Islands of England","Islands of the Bristol Channel","Ports and harbours of the Bristol Channel","Scheduled monuments in North Somerset","Sites of Special Scientific Interest in North Somerset","Sites of Special Scientific Interest notified in 1952","Weston-super-Mare"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Steep Holm: A Rugged Island Jewel\n\nSteep Holm, a limestone isle in the Bristol Channel, is celebrated for its wartime history and vibrant wildlife.

It was built in 1912 and designed by architect Thomas W. Lamb for impresario John Cort. An annex to the west of the theater, built between 2021 and 2022, was designed by Kostow Greenwood Architects. The Jones has 1,092 seats across three levels and is operated by the Shubert Organization. Both the facade and interior of the theater are New York City designated landmarks.\n\nThe theater maintains much of its original neoclassical design. Its 48th Street facade has a glass-and-metal marquee shielding the entrances, as well as a colonnade with an additional story above. The lobby has marble paneling and a coved ceiling. The auditorium contains a ground-level orchestra and two overhanging balconies with boxes. The auditorium's proscenium arch is designed with \"art glass\" that can illuminate during performances, and its ceiling is coved. The western annex contains lounges, restrooms, and backstage areas.\n\nJohn Cort received the rights to operate the theater in January 1912, and the Cort Theatre opened on December 20, 1912. Despite being regarded by the theatrical community as being on the \"wrong side\" of Broadway, the Cort hosted numerous hit productions during its early years. The Shubert Organization purchased the theater in 1927, two years before Cort's death. Though the theater was used as a television studio for The Merv Griffin Show from 1969 to 1972, it has mostly remained in theatrical use through the years. The Cort closed temporarily in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic and was renovated during that time. In 2022, it was renamed after actor James Earl Jones, becoming the second Broadway venue named after a Black theatrical personality.\n\n ## Site\n\nThe James Earl Jones Theatre is a Broadway theater on 138 West 48th Street, on the south sidewalk between Seventh Avenue and Sixth Avenue (near Times Square), in the Theater District of Midtown Manhattan in New York City.

He was additionally a lifelong member and secretary of the Kildare Knot, a dining club made up of wealthy individuals regardless of religion. During his tenure, the Knot was involved with the Irish Volunteers, a patriotic militia group dedicated to defending Ireland from potential French invaders. Guinness's primary political positions, however, concerned the rights of Catholics to fully participate in Irish politics and society. In addition to personally hiring Catholics for his brewery, and by accounts treating them fairly, Guinness advocated to overturn laws that restricted the ability of Catholics to enter certain professions, and as a member of the Royal Dublin Society, he argued for economic developments that would positively affect lower-class Catholics in agriculture and domestic industry. He was opposed, however, to the Irish Rebellion of 1798, an uprising of Presbyterian radicals who wished to overthrow British rule in Ireland. Guinness disliked both the economic disruption that the rebellion brought, as well as the violence it incurred. His son John was wounded in the fighting, further incurring the Guinness family's disapproval. Guinness's opposition to the rebellion garnered the ire of Irish Catholics and nationalists, who subsequently referred to his beer as his \"black Protestant porter\".\n\nGuinness was a deeply religious man whose personal motto was Spes Mea in Deo, Latin for \"My Hope is in God\". Although he never converted to Methodism during his life, instead remaining a member of the Church of Ireland, his diaries indicate that his faith was influenced by that of John Wesley and the Methodist model of evangelical social work. He served as treasurer and later Governor of Meath Hospital and frequently donated money to St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. Another religious inspiration for Guinness was Robert Raikes, who promoted Sunday school as a method of eliminating crime by introducing faith and morals early in life. In 1786, Guinness opened the first Sunday school in Dublin.\n\nMany of Guinness's social positions were based in his beliefs of temperance and moderation. He believed that the duty of the wealthy and powerful was to set a strong moral example for their citizenry and looked unfavorably on what he viewed as displays of excess. He once protested the traditional feast of a new alderman, worried that the occasion would lead to drunken impropriety, and instead suggested that the money set aside for the banquet be donated to The King's Hospital. Guinness's investment in penal reform similarly stemmed from his displeasure towards what he believed was excess punishment towards criminals. He was particularly opposed to the culture of dueling among the Irish elite, which he viewed as a deadly sport masquerading as honour, but his efforts to eliminate or reduce dueling were unsuccessful. Despite his generally temperate positions, Guinness never ventured into the teetotalism movement, instead joining the belief of his fellow brewers that drunkenness was attributed to liquor, not to beer.\n\n","h_score":1799447.53125,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1762813,"revid":1173480768,"description":"Irish brewer (1725\u20131803)","categories":["1725 births","1803 deaths","18th-century Anglo-Irish people","18th-century Irish businesspeople","Guinness family","Irish Anglicans","Irish brewers","People from Celbridge"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Arthur Guinness?  \nA1: Arthur Guinness was an 18th-century Irish entrepreneur, best known as the founder of the iconic Guinness brewery.\n\nQ2: When and where was he born?  \nA2: Born in 1725 in County Kildare, Ireland, he grew up in a time of brewing innovation.\n\nQ3: What did he do for a living?  \nA3: He started as a brewer, leasing a brewery in Dublin in 1759 to produce ale and stout.\n\nQ4: How did he begin the Guinness brewery?  \nA4: With a 9,000-year lease on a Dublin site, he focused on crafting dark stout that gained popularity.\n\nQ5: What made his beer unique?  \nA5: His stout featured a rich, creamy texture from innovative techniques, setting it apart in the brewing world.\n\nQ6: How did Guinness impact Ireland?  \nA6: It created jobs and boosted the economy, turning Dublin into a brewing hub.\n\nQ7: What challenges did he face?  \nA7: Economic fluctuations and competition tested his resolve, yet he adapted shrewdly.\n\nQ8: What is his lasting legacy?  \nA8: Guinness stout remains a global icon, symbolizing Irish heritage and entrepreneurial spirit."}

It was originally included in the Watchmen script, but was changed from live-action footage to animation because of the \\$20 million it would have cost to film it in the stylized manner of 300 that Snyder wanted; this animated version, originally intended to be included in the final cut, was then cut because the film was already approaching a three-hour running time. Gerard Butler, who starred in 300, voices the Captain in the animated feature, having been promised a role in the live-action film that never materialized. Jared Harris voices his deceased friend Ridley, whom the Captain hallucinates is talking to him. Snyder had Butler and Harris record their parts together. Like the original live-action film itself, international rights to the Black Freighter film are held by Paramount Home Entertainment.\n\nThe Black Freighter releases also include Under the Hood, a 38-minute, fictional in-universe documentary detailing the characters' backstories, which takes its title from that of Hollis Mason's memoirs in the comic book. Unlike the film and Tales of the Black Freighter which were both R-rated, Under the Hood is PG-rated because it is meant to resemble a behind-the-scenes television news magazine profile of the characters. The actors themselves were allowed to improvise during filming interviews in character. Bolex cameras were even used to film faux archive footage of the Minutemen.\n\nIn addition, the 325-minute Watchmen: Motion Comic was released via Blu-ray, DVD and digital video stores on March 3, 2009, as part of the Warner Premiere: Motion Comics series.\n\nWarner released a 186-minute director's cut of the film, expanded from the 162-minute theatrical cut, on all formats on July 21, 2009. This was followed by the November 10, 2009, home video release of the 215-minute \"Ultimate Cut\". It comprises the director's cut with Tales of the Black Freighter edited in throughout, along with additional newsstand framing sequences.

Rib\u00e9ry was given the number 7 shirt, which was freed up due to the retirement of midfielder Mehmet Scholl at the end of the previous season. He made his team debut one month later, scoring twice in an 18\u20130 friendly drubbing of Munich youth side FT Gern. Rib\u00e9ry made his competitive debut for Bayern on 21 July 2007 against Werder Bremen in the first round of the Premiere Ligapokal, scoring twice and also assisting on another in a 4\u20131 victory. In the semifinals, he netted an early goal in a 2\u20130 win over defending champions VfB Stuttgart. Due to an injury, Rib\u00e9ry was unable to play in the final, which Bayern won.\n\nRib\u00e9ry scored his first league goal for the club on 18 August in a 4\u20130 triumph over Bremen converting a penalty in the 31st minute. He went scoreless in the league for almost two months before scoring a goal and providing the assist on Bayern's other goal in a 2\u20131 win over VfL Bochum. A month later, Rib\u00e9ry recorded this feat again, providing the assist on the opening goal scored by Miroslav Klose and scoring the game winning goal in a 2\u20131 win over VfL Wolfsburg. In the German Cup, he recorded two goals and provided four assists in five matches Bayern contested. He netted his first goal in the competition on 27 February 2008 in Bayern's win over inner-city rivals 1860 Munich, with Rib\u00e9ry converting the lone goal, a penalty, in the final minute of extra time. In the semi-finals, Rib\u00e9ry scored the opening goal in Bayern's 2\u20130 win over Wolfsburg, which resulted in the club qualifying for the final against Borussia Dortmund. In the DFB-Pokal final, Rib\u00e9ry assisted on Luca Toni's opener in the 11th minute in a match Bayern won 2\u20131, thus claiming their 14th cup title.\n\nIn the UEFA Cup, Bayern reached the semi-finals, with Rib\u00e9ry scoring three goals in the competition, including one in the Germans' comeback win over Spanish club Getafe in the quarter-finals. In total, Rib\u00e9ry appeared in 46 matches scoring 16 goals and assisting on 17 goals as Bayern won the league and cup double. For his efforts, on 8 June 2008, Rib\u00e9ry was named the 2007\u201308 Footballer of the Year (Germany). He was also named French Player of the Year for the second consecutive season.\n\n","h_score":1805574.8062500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":3002912,"revid":1170341044,"description":"French footballer (born 1983)","categories":["1983 births","2006 FIFA World Cup players","2010 FIFA World Cup players","ACF Fiorentina players","Bundesliga players","Championnat National 2 players","Championnat National players","Converts to Islam","Expatriate men's footballers in Germany","Expatriate men's footballers in Italy","Expatriate men's footballers in Turkey","FC Bayern Munich footballers","FC Metz players","Footballers from Pas-de-Calais","France men's international footballers","France men's under-21 international footballers","French Muslims","French expatriate men's footballers","French expatriate sportspeople in Germany","French expatriate sportspeople in Italy","French expatriate sportspeople in Turkey","French men's footballers","Galatasaray S.K. footballers","Ligue 1 players","Living people","Men's association football wingers","Olympique Al\u00e8s players","Olympique de Marseille players","People from Boulogne-sur-Mer","Serie A players","Stade Brestois 29 players","S\u00fcper Lig players","UEFA Champions League winning players","UEFA Euro 2008 players","UEFA Euro 2012 players","UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award winners","US Boulogne players","US Salernitana 1919 players"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Franck Rib\u00e9ry?  \nA1: Franck Rib\u00e9ry is a retired French footballer, a dribbling dynamo who lit up pitches worldwide.\n\nQ2: Where was he born?  \nA2: Born in Boulogne, France, in 1983, he rose from humble roots to global stardom.\n\nQ3: What clubs did he play for?  \nA3: Rib\u00e9ry starred at Marseille and Bayern Munich, weaving magic for over a decade.\n\nQ4: What was his playing style?  \nA4: A fearless winger with electric speed and trickery, he turned games into artful chaos.\n\nQ5: What trophies did he win?  \nA5: He claimed nine Bundesliga titles and a Champions League with Bayern, plus France caps.\n\nQ6: Did he face controversies?  \nA6: Rib\u00e9ry weathered scandals like a storm, emerging as a resilient, flawed icon.\n\nQ7: How did he impact football?  \nA7: His flair inspired a generation, blending street hustle with elite precision on the big stage.\n\nQ8: What's his legacy today?  \nA8: As a mentor and legend, Rib\u00e9ry's fiery spirit echoes in modern football's vibrant underdogs."}

Toll met Malick in September of the same year and was asked to do the film in the beginning of 1997. Malick and Toll began location scouting in February 1997 and started principal photography in June of that year.\n\nPre-production went slowly. Weeks before filming began, Malick told Geisler and Roberdeau not to show up in Australia where the film was being made, ostensibly because George Stevens Jr. would be the on-location producer supporting line producer Grant Hill. Malick told them that they had upset the studio for refusing to give up above-the-title production credit to Stevens. He did not tell them that in 1996 he had a clause inserted in his contract barring the producers from the set. Geisler and Roberdeau were mystified about this behavior; Geisler told Entertainment Weekly, \"I didn't think he was capable of betrayal of this magnitude.\"\n\nMalick and Toll shot for 100 days in Australia using Panavision cameras and lenses, 24 days in the Solomon Islands and three days in the United States. They scouted the historic battlefields on Guadalcanal and shot footage, but health concerns over malaria limited filming to daylight hours only. Logistics were also difficult to shoot the entire film there: As director of photography John Toll put it, \"It's still a bit difficult to get on and off the island, and we had some scenes that involved 200 or 300 extras. We would have had to bring everybody to Guadalcanal, and financially it just didn't make sense.\" The Thin Red Line was filmed predominantly in the Daintree Rainforest and on Bramston Beach, both in north Queensland, Australia. Filming also took place on Dancer Mountain, which had such rough terrain that trailers and production trucks could not make it up the hill. A base camp was set up and roads carved out of the mountain. Transporting 250 actors and 200 crew members up the hill took two hours. Filming took place in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California near Santa Catalina Island.\n\nMalick's unconventional filming techniques included shooting part of a scene during a bright, sunny morning only to finish it weeks later at sunset. He made a habit of pointing the camera away during an action sequence and focus on a parrot, a tree branch or other fauna. Malick's reputation and working methods commanded great respect among the actors, with both Woody Harrelson and John Savage staying on for an extra month after they finished all of their scenes just to watch him at work.\n\n","h_score":1807275.175,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":142465,"revid":1173743801,"description":"1998 film by Terrence Malick","categories":["1990s American films","1990s English-language films","1990s war drama films","1998 drama films","1998 films","20th Century Fox films","American World War II films","American historical adventure films","American war adventure films","American war drama films","American war epic films","Anti-war films about World War II","Films about deserters","Films about the United States Army","Films based on American novels","Films directed by Terrence Malick","Films produced by Grant Hill (producer)","Films scored by Hans Zimmer","Films set in 1942","Films set in the Solomon Islands","Films shot in Los Angeles","Films shot in New South Wales","Films shot in Queensland","Films shot in the Solomon Islands","Golden Bear winners","Guadalcanal Campaign","Pacific War films","Phoenix Pictures films","War epic films"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Epic Visions of War: The Thin Red Line at 25\n\nIn 1998, Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line redefined World War II epics with its poetic blend of violence and introspection.

Golden, not aimed at conquest. Rather, Golden writes, they were \"typical of nomads testing the defenses of their sedentary neighbors\" and a means of gathering booty, the acquisition and distribution of which was fundamental to tribal coalitions. According to Golden, for the Khazars the strategic stake of the conflict was control of the Caucasus passes. Albania was probably regarded by the Khazars as rightfully theirs, a legacy of the last Byzantine\u2013Sasanian war. According to historian Bori Zhivkov, \"It is no surprise that they fought fiercely with the Arabs precisely for these lands up to the 730s\".\n\nThe sources do not provide details of the composition or tactics of Khazar armies, and the names of Khazar commanders are rarely recorded. Although the Khazars adopted elements of the civilizations to their south and possessed towns, they remained a tribal, semi-nomadic power. Like other steppe societies originating in Central Asia, they practised a mobile form of warfare and relied on skilled, hardy cavalry. The rapid movements and sudden attacks and counterattacks of the Khazar cavalry are emphasized in the sources; in the few detailed descriptions of pitched battles, the Khazar cavalry launched the opening attacks. Heavy (cataphract) cavalry is not recorded, but archaeological evidence attests to the use of heavy armour for riders and (possibly) horses. The presence of Khazar infantry must be assumed (especially during siege operations), although it is not explicitly mentioned. Modern historians point to the use of advanced siege machines to indicate that Khazar military sophistication was equal to that of other contemporary armies. The less-rigidly-organized, semi-nomadic nature of the Khazar state also worked to their advantage against the Arabs; they lacked a permanent administrative centre, whose loss would paralyze the government and force them to surrender.\n\nThe Khazar army was composed of Khazar troops and those of vassal princes and allies. Its overall size is unclear, and references to 300,000 men in the invasion of 730 are clearly exaggerated. Historian Igor Semyonov observes that the Khazars \"never entered into battle without having a numerical advantage\" over their Arab opponents, which often forced the latter to withdraw. According to Semyonov, this attests to the Khazars' skill in logistics and their ability to gather accurate information about their opponents' movements, the layout of the country, and the condition of roads.\n\n","h_score":1930519.5625,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":6225891,"revid":1173433211,"description":"Series of wars between the Arabs and Khazars over control of the Caucasus","categories":["7th-century conflicts","8th-century conflicts","Arab\u2013Khazar wars","Medieval history of the Caucasus"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What were the Arab\u2013Khazar wars?  \nA1: These were a series of 7th- and 8th-century clashes between the expanding Arab Caliphates and the Khazar Empire, a nomadic power in the Caucasus, over trade routes and borders.\n\nQ2: Who were the main parties involved?  \nA2: The Arabs were represented by the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates, seeking territorial expansion, while the Khazars were a Turkic federation defending their northern steppes with clever alliances.\n\nQ3: When and where did these wars occur?  \nA3: Fought mainly from 642 to 737 AD, the conflicts unfolded in the Caucasus Mountains and surrounding plains, a vital crossroads of ancient trade.\n\nQ4: What sparked the initial conflicts?  \nA4: The wars ignited as Arab conquests pushed northward after the Islamic expansions, clashing with Khazar defenses over control of lucrative Silk Road routes and strategic frontiers.\n\nQ5: What were key battles or strategies?  \nA5: Notable battles included the Khazars' raids into Arab territories and a decisive 737 AD invasion by Arab forces, where the Khazars used guerrilla tactics amid rugged terrain for defense.\n\nQ6: How did the wars affect the regions?  \nA6: They disrupted trade, fostered cultural exchanges like Islamic influences on Khazar society, and solidified borders, shaping the volatile Caucasus as a buffer zone.\n\nQ7: What was the overall outcome?  \nA7: The Khazars repelled major Arab advances, maintaining independence until later declines, but the wars weakened both sides and paved the way for future invasions.\n\nQ8: What is the historical legacy of these wars?  \nA8: They highlighted early medieval power struggles, influencing Jewish-Khazar conversions and Eurasian geopolitics, leaving a vivid tapestry of resilience and cultural fusion in the region's history."}

Here Chiang insisted fervently on mounting a sustained defense of Nanjing. Chiang argued, just as he had during the Battle of Shanghai, that China would be more likely to receive aid from the great powers, possibly at the ongoing Nine Power Treaty Conference, if it could prove on the battlefield its will and capacity to resist the Japanese. He also noted that holding onto Nanjing would strengthen China's hand in peace talks which he wanted the German ambassador Oskar Trautmann to mediate.\n\nChiang ran into stiff opposition from his officers, including the powerful Chief of Staff of the Military Affairs Commission He Yingqin, the Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi, the head of the Fifth War Zone Li Zongren, and his German advisor Alexander von Falkenhausen. They argued that the Chinese Army needed more time to recover from its losses at Shanghai, and pointed out that Nanjing was highly indefensible topographically. The mostly gently sloping terrain in front of Nanjing would make it easy for the attackers to advance on the city, while the Yangtze River behind Nanjing would cut off the defenders' retreat.\n\nChiang, however, had become increasingly agitated over the course of the Battle of Shanghai, even angrily declaring that he would stay behind in Nanjing alone and command its defense personally. But just when Chiang believed himself completely isolated, General Tang Shengzhi, an ambitious senior member of the Military Affairs Commission, spoke out in defense of Chiang's position, although accounts vary on whether Tang vociferously jumped to Chiang's aid or only reluctantly did so. Seizing the opportunity Tang had given him, Chiang responded by organizing the Nanjing Garrison Force on November 20 and officially making Tang its commander on November 25. The orders Tang received from Chiang on November 30 were to \"defend the established defense lines at any cost and destroy the enemy\u2019s besieging force\".\n\nThough both men publicly declared that they would defend Nanjing \"to the last man\", they were aware of their precarious situation. On the same day that the Garrison Force was established Chiang officially moved the capital of China from Nanjing to Chongqing deep in China's interior. Further, both Chiang and Tang would at times give contradictory instructions to their subordinates on whether their mission was to defend Nanjing to the death or merely delay the Japanese advance.\n\n ## Road to Nanjing\n\n","h_score":2152104.8000000003,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":65712,"revid":1163409481,"description":"1937 Second Sino-Japanese War battle","categories":["1937 in China","1937 in Japan","Articles containing video clips","Battles of the Second Sino-Japanese War","Conflicts in 1937","History of Nanjing"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What was the Battle of Nanking?  \nA1: It was a brutal 1937 clash in China's capital, marking the Second Sino-Japanese War's dark turn, with Japanese forces overwhelming Chinese defenders.\n\nQ2: When and where did it occur?  \nA2: From December 1937 in Nanking, now Nanjing, it unfolded amid winter fog and frantic evacuations, lasting weeks of horror.\n\nQ3: Who were the key players?  \nA3: Japanese Imperial Army versus Chinese Nationalist forces, with civilians caught in the crossfire like pawns in a savage chess game.\n\nQ4: What sparked the conflict?  \nA4: It erupted from broader Sino-Japanese tensions, fueled by invasion ambitions and failed ceasefires, igniting like a powder keg.\n\nQ5: What happened during the events?  \nA5: Atrocities included mass killings and assaults, turning streets into rivers of blood, as order crumbled into chaos.\n\nQ6: What were the immediate aftermath effects?  \nA6: Tens of thousands perished, sparking global outrage and war crimes trials, like echoes rippling through history.\n\nQ7: How is it remembered today?  \nA7: As the Nanking Massacre, it's a somber memorial in museums, stirring debates on denial versus atonement in modern dialogues.\n\nQ8: What broader lessons emerge?  \nA8: It highlights war's human cost and the need for accountability, a stark mirror for reflecting on peace's fragile threads."}

Those proteins included enzymes to operate its anaerobic respiration via the Wood\u2013Ljungdahl metabolic pathway, and a DNA polymerase to replicate its genetic material.\n\nThe challenge for abiogenesis (origin of life) researchers is to explain how such a complex and tightly interlinked system could develop by evolutionary steps, as at first sight all its parts are necessary to enable it to function. For example, a cell, whether the LUCA or in a modern organism, copies its DNA with the DNA polymerase enzyme, which is in turn produced by translating the DNA polymerase gene in the DNA. Neither the enzyme nor the DNA can be produced without the other. The evolutionary process could have involved molecular self-replication, self-assembly such as of cell membranes, and autocatalysis.\n\nThe precursors to the development of a living cell like the LUCA are clear enough, if disputed in their details: a habitable world is formed with a supply of minerals and liquid water. Prebiotic synthesis creates a range of simple organic compounds, which are assembled into polymers such as proteins and RNA. The process after the LUCA, too, is readily understood: biological evolution caused the development of a wide range of species with varied forms and biochemical capabilities. The derivation of living things such as the LUCA from simple components, however, is far from understood.\n\nAlthough Earth remains the only place where life is known, the science of astrobiology seeks evidence of life on other planets. The 2015 NASA strategy on the origin of life aimed to solve the puzzle by identifying interactions, intermediary structures and functions, energy sources, and environmental factors that contributed to the diversity, selection, and replication of evolvable macromolecular systems, and mapping the chemical landscape of potential primordial informational polymers. The advent of polymers that could replicate, store genetic information, and exhibit properties subject to selection was, it suggested, most likely a critical step in the emergence of prebiotic chemical evolution. Those polymers derived, in turn, from simple organic compounds such as nucleobases, amino acids, and sugars that could have been formed by reactions in the environment. A successful theory of the origin of life must explain how all these chemicals came into being.\n\n ## Conceptual history until the 1960s\n\n ### Spontaneous generation\n\nOne ancient view of the origin of life, from Aristotle until the 19th century, is of spontaneous generation. This theory held that \"lower\" animals were generated by decaying organic substances, and that life arose by chance. This was questioned from the 17th century, in works like Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica. In 1665, Robert Hooke published the first drawings of a microorganism. In 1676, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek drew and described microorganisms, probably protozoa and bacteria. Van Leeuwenhoek disagreed with spontaneous generation, and by the 1680s convinced himself, using experiments ranging from sealed and open meat incubation and the close study of insect reproduction, that the theory was incorrect. In 1668 Francesco Redi showed that no maggots appeared in meat when flies were prevented from laying eggs. By the middle of the 19th century, spontaneous generation was considered disproven.\n\n ### Panspermia\n\nAnother ancient idea dating back to Anaxagoras in the 5th century BC is panspermia, the idea that life exists throughout the universe, distributed by meteoroids, asteroids, comets and planetoids. It does not attempt to explain how life originated in itself, but shifts the origin of life on Earth to another heavenly body. The advantage is that life is not required to have formed on each planet it occurs on, but rather in a more limited set of locations (potentially even a single location), and then spread about the galaxy to other star systems via cometary or meteorite impact.\n\n ### \"A warm little pond\": primordial soup\n\nThe idea that life originated from non-living matter in slow stages appeared in Herbert Spencer's 1864\u20131867 book Principles of Biology, and in William Turner Thiselton-Dyer's 1879 paper \"On spontaneous generation and evolution\". On 1 February 1871 Charles Darwin wrote about these publications to Joseph Hooker, and set out his own speculation, suggesting that the original spark of life may have begun in a \"warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity, &c., present, that a proteine compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes.\" Darwin went on to explain that \"at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed.\"\n\nAlexander Oparin in 1924 and J. B. S. Haldane in 1929 proposed that the first molecules constituting the earliest cells slowly self-organized from a primordial soup, and this theory is called the Oparin\u2013Haldane hypothesis. Haldane suggested that the Earth's prebiotic oceans consisted of a \"hot dilute soup\" in which organic compounds could have formed. J. D. Bernal showed that such mechanisms could form most of the necessary molecules for life from inorganic precursors. In 1967, he suggested three \"stages\": the origin of biological monomers; the origin of biological polymers; and the evolution from molecules to cells.\n\n ### Miller\u2013Urey experiment\n\nIn 1952, Stanley Miller and Harold Urey carried out a chemical experiment to demonstrate how organic molecules could have formed spontaneously from inorganic precursors under prebiotic conditions like those posited by the Oparin\u2013Haldane hypothesis. It used a highly reducing (lacking oxygen) mixture of gases\u2014methane, ammonia, and hydrogen, as well as water vapor\u2014to form simple organic monomers such as amino acids. Bernal said of the Miller\u2013Urey experiment that \"it is not enough to explain the formation of such molecules, what is necessary, is a physical-chemical explanation of the origins of these molecules that suggests the presence of suitable sources and sinks for free energy.\" However, current scientific consensus describes the primitive atmosphere as weakly reducing or neutral, diminishing the amount and variety of amino acids that could be produced. The addition of iron and carbonate minerals, present in early oceans, however, produces a diverse array of amino acids. Later work has focused on two other potential reducing environments: outer space and deep-sea hydrothermal vents.\n\n ## Producing a habitable Earth\n\n ### Evolutionary history\n\n #### Early universe with first stars\n\nSoon after the Big Bang, which occurred roughly 14 Gya, the only chemical elements present in the universe were hydrogen, helium, and lithium, the three lightest atoms in the periodic table. These elements gradually came together to form stars. These early stars were massive and short-lived, producing all the heavier elements through stellar nucleosynthesis. Carbon, currently the fourth most abundant chemical element in the universe (after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen), was formed mainly in white dwarf stars, particularly those bigger than twice the mass of the sun. As these stars reached the end of their lifecycles, they ejected these heavier elements, among them carbon and oxygen, throughout the universe. These heavier elements allowed for the formation of new objects, including rocky planets and other bodies. According to the nebular hypothesis, the formation and evolution of the Solar System began 4.6 Gya with the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud. Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.\n\n","h_score":2045274.4875,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":19179706,"revid":1173366405,"description":"Natural process by which life arises from non-living matter","categories":["Astrobiology","Beginnings","Evolutionarily significant biological phenomena","Evolutionary biology","Global events","Natural events","Origin of life","Origins","Prebiotic chemistry"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Unlocking Life's Origins: Abiogenesis Explained\n\nAbiogenesis refers to the scientific hypothesis that life arose from non-living chemicals on early Earth.

When a uranium-235 atom undergoes fission, it releases an average of 2.4 neutrons. In the simplest case of an unreflected, homogeneous, spherical reactor, the critical radius was calculated to be approximately: > $R_{crit} \\approx  \\frac{\\pi M}{\\sqrt{k - 1}}$, where M is the average distance that a neutron travels before it is absorbed, and k is the average neutron multiplication factor. The neutrons in succeeding reactions will be amplified by a factor k, the second generation of fission events will produce k<sup>2<\/sup>, the third k<sup>3<\/sup> and so on. In order for a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction to occur, k must be at least 3 or 4 percent greater than 1. In other words, k must be greater than 1 without crossing the prompt critical threshold that would result in a rapid, exponential increase in the number of fission events. Fermi christened his apparatus a \"pile\". Emilio Segr\u00e8 later recalled that: > I thought for a while that this term was used to refer to a source of nuclear energy in analogy with Volta's use of the Italian term pila to denote his own great invention of a source of electrical energy. I was disillusioned by Fermi himself, who told me that he simply used the common English word pile as synonymous with heap. To my surprise, Fermi never seemed to have thought of the relationship between his pile and Volta's. Another grant, this time of \\$40,000, was obtained from the S-1 Uranium Committee to purchase more materials, and in August 1941 Fermi began to plan the building of a sub-critical assembly to test with a smaller structure whether a larger one would work. The so-called exponential pile he proposed to build was 8 feet (2.4 m) long, 8 feet (2.4 m) wide and 11 feet (3.4 m) high. This was too large to fit in the Pupin Physics Laboratories. Fermi recalled that: > We went to Dean Pegram, who was then the man who could carry out magic around the University, and we explained to him that we needed a big room. He scouted around the campus and we went with him to dark corridors and under various heating pipes and so on, to visit possible sites for this experiment and eventually a big room was discovered in Schermerhorn Hall. The pile was built in September 1941 from 4-by-4-by-12-inch (10 by 10 by 30 cm) graphite blocks and tinplate iron cans of uranium oxide. The cans were 8-by-8-by-8-inch (20 by 20 by 20 cm) cubes.

The nature and size of the planned Canadian Corps assault necessitated support and resources beyond its normal operational capabilities. Consequently, the British 5th Infantry Division and supplementary artillery, engineer and labour units reinforced the four Canadian divisions already in place. The 24th British Division of I Corps supported the Canadian Corps along its northern flank while the XVII Corps did so to the south. The ad hoc Gruppe Vimy formation, based under I Bavarian Reserve Corps commander General der Infanterie Karl Ritter von Fasbender, was the principal defending formation with three divisions responsible for manning the frontline defences opposite the Canadian Corps. The attack began at 5:30 am on Easter Monday, 9 April 1917. Light field guns laid down a barrage that advanced in predetermined increments, often 91 metres (100 yd) every three minutes, while medium and heavy howitzers established a series of standing barrages against known defensive systems further ahead. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Canadian Divisions quickly captured their first objectives. The 4th Canadian Division encountered a great deal of trouble during its advance and was unable to complete its first objective until some hours later. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Canadian Divisions captured their second objective by approximately 7:30 am. The failure of the 4th Canadian Division to capture the top of the ridge delayed further advances and forced the 3rd Canadian Division to expend resources establishing a defensive line to its north. Reserve units from the 4th Canadian Division renewed the attack on the German positions on the top of the ridge and eventually forced the German troops holding the southwestern portion of Hill 145 to withdraw. On the morning of 10 April, Canadian Corps commander Lieutenant-General Julian Byng moved up three fresh brigades to support the continued advance. The fresh units leapfrogged units already in place and captured the third objective line, including Hill 135 and the town of Th\u00e9lus, by 11:00 am. By 2:00 pm both the 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions reported capturing their final objectives. By this point the \"Pimple\", a heavily defended knoll west of the town of Givenchy-en-Gohelle, was the only German position remaining on Vimy Ridge. On 12 April, the 10th Canadian Brigade attacked and quickly overcame the hastily entrenched German troops, with the support of artillery and the 24th British Division. By nightfall on 12 April, the Canadian Corps was in firm control of the ridge. The Canadian Corps suffered 10,602 casualties: 3,598 killed and 7,004 wounded. The German Sixth Army suffered an unknown number of casualties, and around 4,000 men became prisoners of war. Although the battle is not generally considered Canada's greatest military feat of arms, the image of national unity and achievement imbued the battle with considerable national significance for Canada. According to Pierce, \"the historical reality of the battle has been reworked and reinterpreted in a conscious attempt to give purpose and meaning to an event that came to symbolize Canada's coming of age as a nation.\" The idea that Canada's identity and nationhood were born out of the battle is an opinion that is widely held in military and general histories of Canada. ## History\n\n","h_score":1875931.6812500001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":952246,"revid":1163796766,"description":"Memorial in Pas-de-Calais, in France","categories":["1936 establishments in France","Canada in World War I","Canada\u2013France relations","Canadian military memorials and cemeteries","Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorials","Monuments and memorials in the Pas-de-Calais","National Historic Sites of Canada in France","Sculptures by Walter Seymour Allward","World War I in the Pas-de-Calais","World War I memorials in France"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Vimy Memorial: Canada's Enduring WWI Legacy\n\nThe Canadian National Vimy Memorial in France honors over 11,000 fallen soldiers from World War I, symbolizing national sacrifice and unity.

A liberalizer march took place in Moscow criticizing Communist Party rule, while at a Central Committee meeting, the hardliner Vladimir Brovikov accused Gorbachev of reducing the country to \"anarchy\" and \"ruin\" and of pursuing Western approval at the expense of the Soviet Union and the Marxist\u2013Leninist cause. Gorbachev was aware that the Central Committee could still oust him as general secretary, and so decided to reformulate the role of head of government to a presidency from which he could not be removed. He decided that the presidential election should be held by the Congress of People's Deputies. He chose this over a public vote because he thought the latter would escalate tensions and feared that he might lose it; a spring 1990 poll nevertheless still showed him as the most popular politician in the country.\n\nIn March, the Congress of People's Deputies held the first (and only) Soviet presidential election, in which Gorbachev was the only candidate. He secured 1,329 in favor to 495 against; 313 votes were invalid or absent. He therefore became the first executive President of the Soviet Union. A new 18-member Presidential Council de facto replaced the Politburo. At the same Congress meeting, he presented the idea of repealing Article 6 of the Soviet constitution, which had ratified the Communist Party as the \"ruling party\" of the Soviet Union. The Congress passed the reform, undermining the de jure nature of the one-party state.\n\nIn the 1990 elections for the Russian Supreme Soviet, the Communist Party faced challengers from an alliance of liberalisers known as \"Democratic Russia\"; the latter did particularly well in urban centers. Yeltsin was elected the parliament's chair, something Gorbachev was unhappy about. That year, opinion polls showed Yeltsin overtaking Gorbachev as the most popular politician in the Soviet Union. Gorbachev struggled to understand Yeltsin's growing popularity, commenting: \"he drinks like a fish ... he's inarticulate, he comes up with the devil knows what, he's like a worn-out record\". The Russian Supreme Soviet was now out of Gorbachev's control; in June 1990, it declared that in the Russian Republic, its laws took precedence over those of the Soviet central government.

The \"changes\" involved have been interpreted as the transformations of hexagrams, of their lines, or of the numbers obtained from the divination. Feng Youlan proposed that the word for \"changes\" originally meant \"easy\", as in a form of divination easier than the oracle bones, but there is little evidence for this. There is also an ancient folk etymology that sees the character for \"changes\" as containing the sun and moon, the cycle of the day. Modern Sinologists believe the character to be derived either from an image of the sun emerging from clouds, or from the content of a vessel being changed into another.\n\nThe Zhou yi was traditionally ascribed to the Zhou cultural heroes King Wen of Zhou and the Duke of Zhou, and was also associated with the legendary world ruler Fu Xi. According to the canonical Great Commentary, Fu Xi observed the patterns of the world and created the eight trigrams (\u516b\u5366; b\u0101gu\u00e0), \"in order to become thoroughly conversant with the numinous and bright and to classify the myriad things.\" The Zhou yi itself does not contain this legend and indeed says nothing about its own origins. The Rites of Zhou, however, also claims that the hexagrams of the Zhou yi were derived from an initial set of eight trigrams. During the Han dynasty there were various opinions about the historical relationship between the trigrams and the hexagrams. Eventually, a consensus formed around 2nd-century AD scholar Ma Rong's attribution of the text to the joint work of Fu Xi, King Wen of Zhou, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius, but this traditional attribution is no longer generally accepted.\n\n","h_score":2088910.7375,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":26335002,"revid":1171202468,"description":"Ancient Chinese text used for divination","categories":["1st-millennium BC books","Chinese books of divination","Chinese folk religion","Esoteric schools of thought","I Ching","Philosophy books","Precursors of electronic literature","Synchronicity","Thirteen Classics","Zhou dynasty texts"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Delving into the I Ching: Ancient Wisdom for Modern Decisions\n\nThe I Ching, or Book of Changes, is a 3,000-year-old Chinese text that uses 64 hexagrams to offer guidance on life's uncertainties.

In a 1998 interview, Aronofsky acknowledged several influences for Pi: \"I'm a big fan of Kurosawa and Fellini. In this film in particular I think there's a lot of Roman Polanski influence and Terry Gilliam influence as well as a Japanese director named Shinya Tsukamoto\u2014he directed The Iron Man, Tetsuo.\" The visual style of Pi and Requiem for a Dream features numerous similarities to Tetsuo: The Iron Man. The majority of reviewers characterized Requiem for a Dream in the genre of \"drug movies\", along with films like The Basketball Diaries, Trainspotting, Spun, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. But, Aronofsky placed his movie in a wider context, saying: > Requiem for a Dream is not about heroin or about drugs ... The Harry-Tyrone-Marion story is a very traditional heroin story. But putting it side by side with the Sara story, we suddenly say, 'Oh, my God, what is a drug?' The idea that the same inner monologue goes through a person's head when they're trying to quit drugs, as with cigarettes, as when they're trying to not eat food so they can lose 20 pounds, was really fascinating to me. I thought it was an idea that we hadn't seen on film and I wanted to bring it up on the screen. Dream logic is another leitmotif. With his friend Ari Handel, Aronofsky developed the plot for The Fountain; the director wrote the screenplay. In 1999, Aronofsky thought that The Matrix redefined the science fiction genre in film. He sought to make a science fiction film that explored new territory, as did The Matrix and its predecessors Star Wars and 2001: A Space Odyssey. He wanted to go beyond science fiction films with plots driven by technology and science. In the Toronto International Film Festival interview conducted by James Rocchi, Aronofsky credited the 1957 Charles Mingus song \"The Clown\" as a major influence on The Wrestler. It is an instrumental piece, with a poem read over the music about a clown who accidentally discovers the bloodlust of the crowds and eventually kills himself in performance. Aronofsky called Black Swan a companion piece to The Wrestler, recalling one of his early projects about a love affair between a wrestler and a ballerina. He eventually separated the wrestling and the ballet worlds, considering them as \"too much for one movie\". He compared the two films: \"Wrestling some consider the lowest art\u2014if they would even call it art\u2014and ballet some people consider the highest art. But what was amazing to me was how similar the performers in both of these worlds are. They both make incredible use of their bodies to express themselves.\" About the psychological thriller nature of Black Swan, actress Natalie Portman compared the film's tone to Polanski's 1968 film Rosemary's Baby, while Aronofsky said Polanski's Repulsion (1965) and The Tenant (1976) were \"big influences\" on the final film. Actor Vincent Cassel also compared Black Swan to Polanski's early films, commenting that it was also influenced by Alejandro Jodorowsky's movies and David Cronenberg's early work. Aronofsky has also mentioned that he \"learned a lot\" from Jean-Luc Godard's film Breathless.","h_score":1922988.9625000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":173294,"revid":1173802862,"description":"American filmmaker","categories":["1969 births","20th-century American Jews","20th-century American male writers","20th-century American screenwriters","21st-century American Jews","21st-century American male writers","21st-century American screenwriters","AFI Conservatory alumni","Activists from New York City","American film directors","American film producers","American male screenwriters","American music video directors","American television producers","Camp Rising Sun alumni","Darren Aronofsky","Directors of Golden Lion winners","Edward R.

Her seventh studio album, Ray of Light, (1998) reflected this change in her perception and image. She collaborated with electronica producer William Orbit and wanted to create a sound that could blend dance music with pop and British rock. American music critic Ann Powers explained that what Madonna searched for with Orbit \"was a kind of a lushness that she wanted for this record. Techno and rave were happening in the 90s and had a lot of different forms. There was very experimental, more hard stuff like Aphex Twin. There was party stuff like Fatboy Slim. That's not what Madonna wanted for this. She wanted something more like a singer-songwriter, really. And William Orbit provided her with that.\" The album garnered critical acclaim, with Slant Magazine calling it \"one of the great pop masterpieces of the '90s\" Ray of Light was honored with four Grammy Awards\u2014including Best Pop Album and Best Dance Recording\u2014and was nominated for both Album of the Year and Record of the Year. Rolling Stone listed it among \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". Commercially, the album peaked at number-one in numerous countries and sold more than 16 million copies worldwide. The album's lead single, \"Frozen\", became Madonna's first single to debut at number one in the UK, while in the U.S. it became her sixth number-two single, setting another record for Madonna as the artist with the most number-two hits. The second single, \"Ray of Light\", debuted at number five on the Billboard Hot 100. The 1998 edition of Guinness Book of World Records documented that \"no female artist has sold more records than Madonna around the world\". Madonna founded Ray of Light Foundation which focused on women, education, global development and humanitarian. She recorded the single \"Beautiful Stranger\" for the 1999 film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, which earned her a Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. Madonna starred in the 2000 comedy-drama film The Next Best Thing, directed by John Schlesinger. The film opened at number two on the U.S. box office with \\$5.9 million grossed in its first week, but this quickly diminished. She also contributed two songs to the film's soundtrack\u2014a cover of Don McLean's 1971 song \"American Pie\" and an original song \"Time Stood Still\"\u2014the former became her ninth UK number-one single. Madonna released her eighth studio album, Music, in September 2000. It featured elements from the electronica-inspired Ray of Light era, and like its predecessor, received acclaim from critics. Collaborating with French producer Mirwais Ahmadza\u00ef, Madonna commented: \"I love to work with the weirdos that no one knows about\u2014the people who have raw talent and who are making music unlike anyone else out there.","h_score":2311904.3000000003,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":142056,"revid":1171389113,"description":"American singer and actress (born 1958)","categories":["1958 births","20th-century American actresses","20th-century American businesspeople","20th-century American businesswomen","20th-century American singers","20th-century American women singers","21st-century American actresses","21st-century American businesspeople","21st-century American businesswomen","21st-century American singers","21st-century American women singers","Activists from Michigan","Activists from New York City","Actresses from Michigan","Actresses from New York City","American LGBT rights activists","American cosmetics businesspeople","American dance musicians","American electronic musicians","American expatriates in Portugal","American expatriates in the United Kingdom","American fashion businesspeople","American female dancers","American film actresses","American gun control activists","American humanitarians","American mezzo-sopranos","American music industry executives","American nonprofit businesspeople","American people of French-Canadian descent","American people of Italian descent","American philanthropists","American pop guitarists","American pop rock singers","American women film directors","American women in business","American women in electronic music","American women pop singers","American women record producers","American women rock singers","American women singer-songwriters","Best Musical or Comedy Actress Golden Globe (film) winners","Brit Award winners","Businesspeople from Michigan","Businesspeople from New York City","Dance-pop musicians","Dancers from Michigan","Dancers from New York (state)","Feminist musicians","Film directors from Michigan","Film directors from New York (state)","Golden Globe Award-winning musicians","Grammy Award winners","Grammy Award winners for dance and electronic music","Interscope Records artists","Ivor Novello Award winners","Juno Award for International Album of the Year winners","Living people","MTV Europe Music Award winners","Madonna","Maverick Records artists","Modern dancers","People from Bay City, Michigan","People from the East Village, Manhattan","People named in the Paradise Papers","Record producers from Michigan","Record producers from New York (state)","Sex-positive feminists","Singer-songwriters from Michigan","Singer-songwriters from New York (state)","Singers from New York City","Sire Records artists","Warner Records artists","Women humanitarians","World Music Awards winners","World record holders"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Madonna: Pop's Eternal Chameleon\n\nThe Material Girl has shaped music and culture for over four decades with boundary-pushing hits and reinventions.

Referring to a \"feminised history\", he said: \"so many of the writers who write about this are women and so much of their audience is a female audience.\" This prompted the historian Lucy Worsley to describe his comments as misogynistic. More recently, in 2011, he taught five history lessons in Channel 4's Jamie's Dream School, after which he criticised the state education system. > The core of history is narrative and biography. And the way history has been presented in the curriculum for the last 25 years is very different. The importance of knowledge has been downgraded. Instead the argument has been that it's all about skills. Supposedly, what you are trying to do with children is inculcate them with the analytical skills of the historian. Now this seems to me to be the most goddamn awful way to approach any subject, and also the most dangerous, and one, of course, that panders to all sorts of easy assumptions \u2013 \u2018oh we've got the internet, we don't need knowledge anymore because it's so easy to look things up'. Oh no it isn't. In order to think, you actually need the information in your mind. In 1984, Starkey was elected a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and in 1994 a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. He was also made an Honorary Fellow by his Cambridge College, Fitzwilliam College in 2006. From 2007 to 2015 he was Honorary Visiting Professor of History at the University of Kent and subsequently Lecturer at Goldsmiths\u2019 College (2017), Visiting Professor of History of Canterbury Christ Church University (2018\u201320) and Honorary Professor of History at the University of Buckingham (2019\u201320). He has worked as curator on several exhibitions, including an exhibit in 2003 on Elizabeth I, following which he had lunch with her namesake, Elizabeth II. Several years later he told a reporter that the monarch had no interest in her predecessors, other than those who followed her great-grandfather, Edward VII. \"I don't think she's at all comfortable with anybody \u2013 I would hesitate to use the word intellectual \u2013 but it's useful. I think she's got elements a bit like Goebbels in her attitude to culture \u2013 you remember: 'every time I hear the word culture I reach for my revolver.' I think the queen reaches for her mask.\" His remarks were criticised by Penny Junor, a royal biographer, and Robert Lacey, a royal historian.

Visitation to Glacier National Park averaged about 3.5 million visitors in 2019, which surpassed its 2017 peak of 3.31 million. Glacier has had at least 2 million annual visitors consistently since 2012, but has broken annual attendance records from 2014 to 2018.\n\nGlacier National Park finished with a \\$13.803 million budget in 2016, with a planned budget of \\$13.777 million for 2017. In anticipation of the 100th anniversary of the park in 2010, major reconstruction of the Going-to-the-Sun Road was completed. The Federal Highway Administration managed the reconstruction project in cooperation with the National Park Service. Some rehabilitation of major structures such as visitor centers and historic hotels, as well as improvements in wastewater treatment facilities and campgrounds, are expected to be completed by the anniversary date. The National Park Service is engaged in fishery studies for Lake McDonald to assess status and develop protection programs to enhance native fish populations. The restoration of park trails, education and youth programs, park improvements and many community programs have been planned and are ongoing.\n\nThe National Park Service mandate is to \"...  preserve and protect natural and cultural resources\". The Organic Act of August 25, 1916 established the National Park Service as a federal agency. One major section of the Act has often been summarized as the \"Mission\", \"...  to promote and regulate the use of the  ... national parks  ... which purpose is to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wildlife therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\" In keeping with this mandate, hunting is illegal in the park, as are mining, logging, and the removal of natural or cultural resources. Additionally, oil and gas exploration and extraction are not permitted. These restrictions, however, caused a lot of conflict with the adjoining Blackfeet Indian Reservation. When they sold the land to the United States government, it was with the stipulation of being able to maintain their usage rights of the area, many of which (such as hunting) had come into conflict with these regulations.\n\nIn 1974, a wilderness study was submitted to Congress which identified 95% of the area of the park as qualifying for wilderness designation. Unlike a few other parks, Glacier National Park has yet to be protected as wilderness, but National Park Service policy requires that identified areas listed in the report be managed as wilderness until Congress renders a full decision. Ninety-three percent of Glacier National Park is managed as wilderness, even though it has not been officially designated.\n\n","h_score":1990698.0437500002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":226211,"revid":1173840973,"description":"Park in Montana on the Canadian border","categories":["1910 establishments in Montana","Biosphere reserves of the United States","Civilian Conservation Corps in Montana","Geology of Montana","Glacier National Park (U.S.)","Glaciers of North America","History of the Rocky Mountains","Lewis Range","Livingston Range","National parks in Montana","National parks of the Rocky Mountains","Protected areas established in 1910","Protected areas of Flathead County, Montana","Protected areas of Glacier County, Montana","Rocky Mountains","World Heritage Sites in the United States"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's Glacier National Park, you ask?  \nA1: It's a majestic Montana wilderness, crowned with ancient glaciers and jagged peaks, offering a playground of raw beauty in the Rockies.  \n\nQ2: Where exactly is this icy haven?  \nA2: Tucked in northwest Montana, USA, bordering Canada, it's a gateway to the Crown of the Continent.  \n\nQ3: What makes it stand out visually?  \nA3: Think turquoise lakes, cascading waterfalls, and forests alive with wildflowers\u2014glaciers slowly melting into dramatic vistas.  \n\nQ4: Any adventures for thrill-seekers?  \nA4: Hike epic trails, drive the Going-to-the-Sun Road, or kayak pristine waters amid towering mountains.  \n\nQ5: What's the wildlife like?  \nA5: Spot grizzlies roaming, elk grazing, and eagles soaring\u2014it's a vibrant ecosystem teeming with untamed life.  \n\nQ6: How did it all form?  \nA6: Glaciers carved these landscapes over eons, shaped by ice ages and erosion, creating a geological masterpiece.  \n\nQ7: Is climate change impacting it?  \nA7: Sadly, yes\u2014glaciers are shrinking fast, threatening biodiversity and underscoring urgent environmental tales.  \n\nQ8: Why visit this frozen wonder?  \nA8: For soul-stirring sunsets and unexpected insights into nature's fragility, blending adventure with profound reflection."}

Polish cultural activities in Minsk and Vilnius were less organized. These activities were strictly controlled by the Soviet authorities, which saw to it that these activities portrayed the new Soviet regime in a positive light and vilified the former Polish government. The Soviet propaganda-motivated support for Polish-language cultural activities, however, clashed with the official policy of Russification. The Soviets at first intended to phase out the Polish language and so banned Polish from schools, street signs, and other aspects of life. This policy was, however, reversed at times\u2014first before the elections in October 1939; and later, after the German conquest of France. In November 1940, the Poles of Lw\u00f3w observed the 85th anniversary of Adam Mickiewicz's death. Soon, however, Stalin decided to re-implement the Russification policies. He reversed his decision again, however, when a need arose for Polish-language pro-Soviet propaganda following the German invasion of the Soviet Union; as a result, Stalin permitted the creation of Polish forces in the East and later decided to create a Communist People's Republic of Poland. Many Polish writers collaborated with the Soviets, writing pro-Soviet propaganda. They included Jerzy Borejsza, Tadeusz Boy-\u017bele\u0144ski, Kazimierz Brandys, Janina Broniewska, Jan Brzoza, Teodor Bujnicki, Leon Chwistek, Zuzanna Ginczanka, Halina G\u00f3rska, Mieczys\u0142aw Jastrun, Stefan J\u0119drychowski, Stanis\u0142aw Jerzy Lec, Tadeusz \u0141opalewski, Juliusz Kleiner, Jan Kott, Jalu Kurek, Karol Kuryluk, Leopold Lewin, Anatol Miku\u0142ko, Jerzy Pa\u0144ski, Leon Pasternak, Julian Przybo\u015b, Jerzy Putrament, Jerzy Rawicz, Adolf Rudnicki, W\u0142odzimierz S\u0142obodnik, W\u0142odzimierz Sokorski, El\u017cbieta Szempli\u0144ska, Anatol Stern, Julian Stryjkowski, Lucjan Szenwald, Leopold Tyrmand, Wanda Wasilewska, Stanis\u0142aw Wasilewski, Adam Wa\u017cyk, Aleksander Weintraub and Bruno Winawer. Other Polish writers, however, rejected the Soviet persuasions and instead published underground: Jadwiga Czechowicz\u00f3wna, Jerzy Hordy\u0144ski, Jadwiga Gamska-\u0141empicka, Herminia Naglerowa, Beata Oberty\u0144ska, Ostap Ortwin, Tadeusz Peiper, Teodor Parnicki, Juliusz Petry. Some writers, such as W\u0142adys\u0142aw Broniewski, after collaborating with the Soviets for a few months, joined the anti-Soviet opposition. Similarly, Aleksander Wat, initially sympathetic to communism, was arrested by the Soviet NKVD secret police and exiled to Kazakhstan. ## Underground culture\n\n ### Patrons\n\nPolish culture persisted in underground education, publications, even theater. The Polish Underground State created a Department of Education and Culture (under Stanis\u0142aw Lorentz) which, along with a Department of Labor and Social Welfare (under Jan Stanis\u0142aw Jankowski and, later, Stefan Mateja) and a Department for Elimination of the Effects of War (under Antoni Olszewski and Bronis\u0142aw Domos\u0142awski), became underground patrons of Polish culture. These Departments oversaw efforts to save from looting and destruction works of art in state and private collections (most notably, the giant paintings by Jan Matejko that were concealed throughout the war). They compiled reports on looted and destroyed works and provided artists and scholars with means to continue their work and their publications and to support their families. Thus, they sponsored the underground publication (bibu\u0142a) of works by Winston Churchill and Arkady Fiedler and of 10,000 copies of a Polish primary-school primer and commissioned artists to create resistance artwork (which was then disseminated by Operation N and like activities). Also occasionally sponsored were secret art exhibitions, theater performances and concerts.\n\nOther important patrons of Polish culture included the Roman Catholic Church and Polish aristocrats, who likewise supported artists and safeguarded Polish heritage (notable patrons included Cardinal Adam Stefan Sapieha and a former politician, Janusz Radziwi\u0142\u0142). Some private publishers, including Stefan Kamie\u0144ski, Zbigniew Mitzner and the Ossolineum publishing house, paid writers for books that would be delivered after the war.\n\n","h_score":1874879.9312500001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":10318947,"revid":1168568437,"description":null,"categories":["Cultural history of Poland","Cultural history of World War II","Poland in World War II"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What was the impact of World War II on Polish culture?  \nA1: WWII devastated Polish culture through occupation and destruction, leading to suppression of traditions.  \n\nQ2: How did Poles preserve their language during the war?  \nA2: Poles used underground education and publications to maintain their language despite bans.  \n\nQ3: What role did art play in Polish resistance?  \nA3: Art served as a tool for secret expression and morale, often hidden from occupiers.  \n\nQ4: How were traditional festivals affected?  \nA4: Many festivals were banned, but some continued covertly to sustain cultural identity.  \n\nQ5: What about Polish literature during this period?  \nA5: Writers produced clandestine works to preserve heritage and resist propaganda.  \n\nQ6: How did music reflect Polish culture then?  \nA6: Music was used in resistance songs, keeping national spirit alive underground.  \n\nQ7: What was the effect on Polish folklore?  \nA7: Folklore was adapted in secret gatherings, helping maintain oral traditions.  \n\nQ8: How did the war shape postwar Polish culture?  \nA8: It fostered resilience, influencing modern expressions of national identity."}

The alluvial deposits are typically over a thousand feet thick. The interfluves are believed to have been formed during the Late Pleistocene and feature river terraces. These were later identified as old and young floodplains of the Ravi River on the Kamalia and Chenab Plains. The old floodplains consist of Holocene deposits from the Ravi and Chenab rivers.\n\nThe soil consists of young stratified silt loam or very fine sand loam which makes the subsoil weak in structure with common kankers at only five feet. The course of the rivers within Faisalabad are winding and often subject to frequent alternations. In the rainy season, the currents are very strong. This leads to high floods in certain areas which do last for a number of days. The Rakh and Gogera canals have encouraged the water levels in the district however the belt on the Ravi River has remained narrow. The river bed does include the river channels which have shifted the sand bars and low sandy levees leading to river erosion. Faisalabad is situated at the centre of the lower Rechna Doab, the area is located between the Chenab and Ravi rivers. There is a mild slope from the northeast to the southwest with an average fall of 0.2\u20130.3 metres per kilometre (1.1\u20131.6 feet per mile).

Tesla believed that atoms are immutable\u2014they could not change state or be split in any way. He was a believer in the 19th-century concept of an all-pervasive ether that transmitted electrical energy.\n\nTesla was generally antagonistic towards theories about the conversion of matter into energy. He was also critical of Einstein's theory of relativity, saying:\n\n> I hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have no properties. It might as well be said that God has properties. He has not, but only attributes and these are of our own making. Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space.

On the site bounded by West 15th and 19th Streets between Surf Avenue and the boardwalk, Bullard wanted to build a \\$55 million amusement park based on the originals. The city agreed, and the project was approved in 1985. Bullard planned to open the park by mid-1986 to coincide with the Statue of Liberty's centennial. However, the project was delayed while the New York City Planning Commission compiled an environmental impact report. By early 1987, the cost of the amusement park nearly doubled, to \\$100 million. Concurrently, in December 1986, the New York State Urban Development Corporation formally proposed a 17,000-seat minor-league baseball stadium north of the boardwalk between West 19th and West 22nd Streets as well as 15,000-seat indoor arena north of the Abe Stark Rink. Negotiations were ongoing with the Mets and Yankees to ensure their support for the minor-league stadium. State senator Thomas Bartosiewicz attempted to block Bullard's plan, as he was part of a foundation that had promised another developer, Sportsplex, the right to build an amateur sports arena on the site. Construction was held up for another four years, and by 1989, Bullard and the city were ready to sign a contract that would allow the developer to construct a 60-ride amusement park on a 25-acre (10 ha) waterfront strip, which would be completed by 2002. Other proposals for the area included a \\$7.9 million restoration of the boardwalk, as well as a new high-school and college sports stadium. Some of Coney Island's iconic rides were designated as official city landmarks during the late 1980s. In 1988, the Cyclone roller coaster was made a New York City designated landmark. This was followed by the Parachute Jump and the Wonder Wheel in 1989. The neighborhood's high crime rate had reversed slightly by the 1990s. However, Coney Island's relative isolation from the rest of New York City, along with its ethnic diversity, deprived the area of significant political power, and to a greater extent money. After Rudy Giuliani took office as New York City mayor in 1994, he negated the Bullard deal by approving the construction of a minor-league baseball stadium on the site allotted for Steeplechase Park. Giuliani had wanted to build Sportsplex in order to improve sports facilities in the area, and to create a professional baseball team in Brooklyn. By the late 1990s, some \\$67 million had been secured for the development of Sportsplex. In 1997, developer Bruce Ratner proposed constructing a \\$100 million entertainment complex between West 9th and West 15th Streets, with a \"virtual-reality amusement park\" as well as a movie theater multiplex. Concurrently, a four-phase, 873-unit housing development in Coney Island was completed in 1996. In 1998, Giuliani canceled Sportsplex and the entertainment complex, and instead unveiled another plan where only the parking lot would be built. The Sports Foundation had prepared another proposal that would allow a scaled-down Sportsplex to be built next to the minor-league baseball stadium. The minor league team was called the Brooklyn Cyclones, though naming rights to the stadium were sold to Keyspan Energy. Bullard, now no longer rebuilding Steeplechase Park, had wanted to restore the Thunderbolt as part of a scaled-down amusement park, but it was demolished instead. In 2000, the city approved the \\$31 million project to construct Keyspan Park using the funds from the canceled Sportsplex, and the minor-league baseball stadium opened the following year. Other major projects at the time included the reconstruction of Coney Island's sewers and the refurbishment of the Stillwell Avenue subway station, the latter of which was completed in 2005.","h_score":2089973.6625000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":151663,"revid":1173043579,"description":"Neighborhood of Brooklyn in New York City","categories":["Amusement parks in New York (state)","Articles containing video clips","Barrier islands of New York (state)","Coney Island","Former islands of New York City","Islands of Brooklyn","Islands of New York City","Neighborhoods in Brooklyn","Populated coastal places in New York (state)","Seaside resorts in New York (state)"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Coney Island?  \nA1: Coney Island is a vibrant seaside neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York, famed for its beaches and amusement rides.  \n\nQ2: Where is it located?  \nA2: It's at the southern tip of Brooklyn, along the Atlantic Ocean, easily reachable from Manhattan.  \n\nQ3: What are its main attractions?  \nA3: Key draws include the iconic Cyclone rollercoaster, Luna Park, and the boardwalk lined with games and food stalls.  \n\nQ4: What's its history?  \nA4: Originating in the 19th century as a resort, it boomed with amusement parks in the early 1900s, facing declines and revivals since.  \n\nQ5: How has it evolved over time?  \nA5: From a glamorous escape for the masses, it's modernized with new rides and events, blending nostalgia with fresh entertainment.  \n\nQ6: Why is it culturally significant?  \nA6: It symbolizes American leisure and pop culture, inspiring films and literature as a democratic playground for all.  \n\nQ7: What can visitors do there?  \nA7: Visitors can ride thrill attractions, stroll the beach, or enjoy hot dogs and fireworks, creating timeless summer memories.  \n\nQ8: Is it still popular today?  \nA8: Yes, it draws crowds for annual events like the Mermaid Parade, remaining a lively, accessible escape in modern New York."}

The disease is caused by infection with a member of the genus Enterovirus known as poliovirus (PV). This group of RNA viruses colonize the gastrointestinal tract \u2013 specifically the oropharynx and the intestine. Its structure is quite simple, composed of a single (+) sense RNA genome enclosed in a protein shell called a capsid. In addition to protecting the virus' genetic material, the capsid proteins enable poliovirus to infect certain types of cells. Three serotypes of poliovirus have been identified \u2013 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), type 2 (WPV2), and type 3 (WPV3) \u2013 each with a slightly different capsid protein. All three are extremely virulent and produce the same disease symptoms. PV1 is the most commonly encountered form, and the one most closely associated with paralysis. WPV2 was certified as eradicated in 2015 and WPV3 certified as eradicated in 2019.\n\nThe incubation period (from exposure to the first signs and symptoms) ranges from three to six days for nonparalytic polio. If the disease progresses to cause paralysis, this occurs within 7 to 21 days.\n\nIndividuals who are exposed to the virus, either through infection or by immunization via polio vaccine, develop immunity. In immune individuals, IgA antibodies against poliovirus are present in the tonsils and gastrointestinal tract and able to block virus replication; IgG and IgM antibodies against PV can prevent the spread of the virus to motor neurons of the central nervous system. Infection or vaccination with one serotype of poliovirus does not provide immunity against the other serotypes, and full immunity requires exposure to each serotype.\n\nA rare condition with a similar presentation, nonpoliovirus poliomyelitis, may result from infections with enteroviruses other than poliovirus.\n\nThe oral polio vaccine contains weakened viruses that can replicate. On rare occasions, these may be transmitted from the vaccinated person to other people, who may display symptoms of polio. In communities with good vaccine coverage transmission is limited, and the virus dies out. In communities with low vaccine coverage, this weakened virus may continue to circulate. Polio arising from this cause is referred to as circulating vaccine-derived polio (cVDPV) in order to distinguish it from the natural or \"wild\" poliovirus (WPV).\n\n ### Transmission\n\nPoliomyelitis is highly contagious. The disease is transmitted primarily via the fecal\u2013oral route, by ingesting contaminated food or water. It is occasionally transmitted via the oral\u2013oral route. It is seasonal in temperate climates, with peak transmission occurring in summer and autumn. These seasonal differences are far less pronounced in tropical areas. Polio is most infectious between 7 and 10 days before and after the appearance of symptoms, but transmission is possible as long as the virus remains in the saliva or feces.

At least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart\n2. One unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years\n3. Diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome\n\nFurthermore, epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who had an age-dependent epilepsy syndrome but are now past that age or those who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the last 5 years.\n\nThis 2014 definition of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) is a clarification of the ILAE 2005 conceptual definition, according to which epilepsy is \"a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiologic, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The definition of epilepsy requires the occurrence of at least one epileptic seizure.\"\n\nIt is, therefore, possible to outgrow epilepsy or to undergo treatment that causes epilepsy to be resolved, but with no guarantee that it will not return. In the definition, epilepsy is now called a disease, rather than a disorder. This was a decision of the executive committee of the ILAE, taken because the word \"disorder,\" while perhaps having less stigma than does \"disease,\" also does not express the degree of seriousness that epilepsy deserves.\n\nThe definition is practical in nature and is designed for clinical use. In particular, it aims to clarify when an \"enduring predisposition\" according to the 2005 conceptual definition is present. Researchers, statistically minded epidemiologists, and other specialized groups may choose to use the older definition or a definition of their own devising. The ILAE considers doing so is perfectly allowable, so long as it is clear what definition is being used.\n\nThe ILAE definition for one seizure needs an understanding of projecting an enduring predisposition to the generation of epileptic seizures. WHO for instance chooses to just use the traditional definition of two unprovoked seizures.\n\n ### Classification\n\nIn contrast to the classification of seizures which focuses on what happens during a seizure, the classification of epilepsies focuses on the underlying causes. When a person is admitted to hospital after an epileptic seizure the diagnostic workup results preferably in the seizure itself being classified (e.g. tonic-clonic) and in the underlying disease being identified (e.g. hippocampal sclerosis). The name of the diagnosis finally made depends on the available diagnostic results and the applied definitions and classifications (of seizures and epilepsies) and its respective terminology.\n\nThe International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) provided a classification of the epilepsies and epileptic syndromes in 1989 as follows:\n\n{\\| cellpadding=5 style=\"border:1px solid \\#ccc\"\n\n\\|- bgcolor=\"#fafafa\" \\|\n\n1. Localization-related epilepsies and syndromes\n    1.  Unknown cause (e.g. benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes)\n    2.

By May 1982, ON TV in southern California had reached its zenith\u2014400,000 subscribers, representing two-thirds of Oak's base of some 600,000 paying customers in its five ON TV markets, not counting Detroit, Cincinnati, or Portland. After the FCC repealed a rule in late 1982 that required television stations offering a subscription service to broadcast at least 20 hours a week of unencrypted programming, KBSC began running ON TV 24 hours a day and displaced its existing Spanish-language daytime programming. However, the STV industry took a national nosedive moving into 1983. A national recession and the increased penetration of multichannel cable television created new and immediate financial headwinds for Oak and ON TV. In March 1984, the company announced that it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and it posted a loss of \\$166.1 million for 1983. One of the company's auditors, Arthur Andersen, qualified its statement, fearing that Oak could not fully realize its \\$134 million investment in subscription television.
