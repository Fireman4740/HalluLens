His biographer Jonathan Schneer writes: > Lansbury was a talented politician, speaker, and organizer. What made him remarkable was the stubbornness with which he clung to his principles... [He] became one of the best-loved and most-respected figures in the labour movement. Lansbury's legacy has been the adamantine insistence among an element within the Labour Party that Britain must stand for moral principles, must set the world a moral example. Concretely, this has meant demanding the total abolition of capitalism and unilateral disarmament, policies that Labour's leaders have usually thought utopian or worse. Historian A. J. P. Taylor labelled Lansbury as \"the most lovable figure in modern politics\" and the outstanding figure of the English revolutionary left in the 20th century, while Kenneth O. Morgan, in his biography of a later Labour leader, Michael Foot, regards Lansbury as \"an agitator of protest, not a politician of power\". Journalists commonly accused Lansbury of sentimentality, and party intellectuals accused him of lacking mental capacity. Nevertheless, his speeches in the House of Commons were often flavoured with historical and literary allusions, and he left behind a considerable body of writing on socialist ideas; Morgan refers to him as a \"prophet\". Foot, who as a young man met and was influenced by Lansbury, was particularly impressed by the older man's achievements in establishing the Daily Herald, given his complete lack of journalistic training. Nevertheless, Foot felt that Lansbury's pacifism was unrealistic, and believed that Bevin's demolition at the 1935 conference was justified. There is much agreement among historians and analysts that Lansbury was never self-serving and, guided by his Christian socialist principles, was consistent in his efforts on behalf of the poorest in society. Shepherd believes that \"there could have been no better leader for the Labour Party at the collapse of its political fortunes in 1931 than Lansbury, a universally popular choice and a source of inspiration among Labour ranks\". In the House of Commons on 8 May 1940, the day following Lansbury's death, Chamberlain said of him: \"There were not many hon. Members who felt convinced of the practicability of the methods which he advocated for the preservation of peace, but there was no one who did not realise his intense conviction, which arose out of his deep humanitarianism\". Attlee also paid tribute to his former leader: \"He hated cruelty, injustice and wrongs, and felt deeply for all who suffered ... [H]e was ever the champion of the weak, and ... to the end of his life he strove for that in which he believed\". After the Second World War, a stained glass window designed by the Belgian artist Eugeen Yoors was placed in the Kingsley Hall community centre in Bow, as a memorial to Lansbury. His memory is further sustained by streets and housing developments named after him, most notably the Lansbury Estate in Poplar, completed in 1951. A further enduring memorial, Attlee suggests, is the extent to which the then-revolutionary social policies that Lansbury began advocating before the turn of the 20th century had become accepted mainstream doctrine little more than a decade after his death. His name and picture (and those of 58 other women's suffrage supporters) are on the plinth of the statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, London, unveiled in 2018.","h_score":1897911.64375,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":166964,"revid":1164688269,"description":"British politician and reformer (1859\u20131940)","categories":["1859 births","1940 deaths","Anglican pacifists","Anglican socialists","Chairs of the Labour Party (UK)","Councillors in Greater London","Deaths from cancer in England","Deaths from stomach cancer","English Christian pacifists","English Christian socialists","English feminists","English reformers","English republicans","English socialist feminists","European democratic socialists","Independent Labour Party National Administrative Committee members","Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies","Labour Party (UK) mayors","Lansbury family","Leaders of the Labour Party (UK)","Leaders of the Opposition (United Kingdom)","Male feminists","Members of London County Council","Members of Poplar Metropolitan Borough Council","Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom","Parliamentary Peace Aims Group","People from Halesworth","Social Democratic Federation members","Transport and General Workers' Union-sponsored MPs","UK MPs 1910\u20131918","UK MPs 1922\u20131923","UK MPs 1923\u20131924","UK MPs 1924\u20131929","UK MPs 1929\u20131931","UK MPs 1931\u20131935","UK MPs 1935\u20131945"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was George Lansbury?  \nA1: George Lansbury was a British politician.

Cobden, an early supporter of women's suffrage, was the fourth child of the Victorian radical statesman Richard Cobden. The Society for Promoting Women as County Councillors (SPWCC), a new women's rights group, had proposed Cobden as the candidate for Bow and Bromley and Margaret Sandhurst for Brixton. Lansbury counselled Cobden in the issues of greatest concern to the East End electorate: housing for the poor, ending of sweated labour, rights of public assembly, and control of the police. Specific questions of women's rights were largely avoided during the campaign. On 19 January 1889 both women were elected; these triumphs were, however, short-lived. Sandhurst's qualification to serve as a county councillor was successfully challenged in the courts by her Conservative Party opponents on the grounds of her sex, and her subsequent appeal was dismissed. Cobden was not immediately challenged, but in April 1891, after a series of legal actions, she was effectively neutered as a councillor by being prevented from voting on pain of severe financial penalties. Lansbury urged her, during the hearings, to \"go to prison and let the Council back you up by refusing to declare your seat vacant\". Cobden did not follow this path. A Bill introduced in the House of Commons in May 1891 permitting women to serve as county councillors found little support among MPs of any party; women were not granted this right until 1907.\n\nLansbury was offended by his party's lukewarm support for women's rights. In a letter published in the Pall Mall Gazette he made an open call to Bow and Bromley's Liberals to \"shake themselves free of party feeling and throw the energy and ability they are now wasting on minor questions into ... securing the full rights of citizenship to every woman in the land\". He was further disillusioned by his party's failure to endorse the eight-hour maximum working day. Lansbury had formed the view, expressed some years later, that \"Liberalism would progress just as far as the great money bags of capitalism would allow it to progress\". By 1892 the Liberals no longer felt like Lansbury's political home; most of his current associates were avowed socialists: William Morris, Eleanor Marx, John Burns and Henry Hyndman, founder of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF). Nevertheless, Lansbury did not resign from the Liberals until he had fulfilled a commitment to act as election agent for John Murray MacDonald, the prospective Liberal candidate for Bow and Bromley. He saw his candidate victorious in the July 1892 general election; as soon as the result was declared, Lansbury resigned from the Liberal Party and joined the SDF.\n\n ## Socialist reformer\n\n","h_score":1897911.64375,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":166964,"revid":1164688269,"description":"British politician and reformer (1859\u20131940)","categories":["1859 births","1940 deaths","Anglican pacifists","Anglican socialists","Chairs of the Labour Party (UK)","Councillors in Greater London","Deaths from cancer in England","Deaths from stomach cancer","English Christian pacifists","English Christian socialists","English feminists","English reformers","English republicans","English socialist feminists","European democratic socialists","Independent Labour Party National Administrative Committee members","Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies","Labour Party (UK) mayors","Lansbury family","Leaders of the Labour Party (UK)","Leaders of the Opposition (United Kingdom)","Male feminists","Members of London County Council","Members of Poplar Metropolitan Borough Council","Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom","Parliamentary Peace Aims Group","People from Halesworth","Social Democratic Federation members","Transport and General Workers' Union-sponsored MPs","UK MPs 1910\u20131918","UK MPs 1922\u20131923","UK MPs 1923\u20131924","UK MPs 1924\u20131929","UK MPs 1929\u20131931","UK MPs 1931\u20131935","UK MPs 1935\u20131945"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### George Lansbury: Champion of the Working Class\n\nGeorge Lansbury was a key British Labour leader who fought tirelessly for social justice and peace in the early 20th century.

In place of the traditionally harsh workhouse regime that was the norm, Lansbury proposed a programme of reform, whereby the workhouse became \"an agency of help instead of a place of despair\", and the stigma of poverty was removed. Lansbury was one of a minority socialist bloc which was often able, through its energy and commitment, to win support for its plans.\n\nEducation for the poor was one of Lansbury's major concerns. He helped to transform the Forest Gate District School, previously a punitive establishment run on quasi-military lines, into a proper place of education that became the Poplar Training School, and was still in existence more than half a century later. At the 1897 annual Poor Law Conference Lansbury summarised his views on poor relief in his first published paper: \"The Principles of the English Poor Law\". His analysis offered a Marxist critique of capitalism: only the reorganisation of industry on collectivist lines would solve contemporary problems.\n\nLansbury added to his public duties when, in 1903, he was elected to Poplar Borough Council. In the summer of that year he met Joseph Fels, a rich American soap manufacturer with a penchant for social projects. Lansbury persuaded Fels, in 1904, to purchase a 100-acre farm at Laindon, in Essex, which was converted into a labour colony that provided regular work for Poplar's unemployed and destitute. Fels also agreed to finance a much larger colony at Hollesley Bay in Suffolk, to be operated as a government scheme under the Local Government Board. Both projects were initially successful, but were undermined after the election of a Liberal government in 1906. The new Local Government minister was John Burns, a former SDF stalwart now ensconced in the Liberal Party who had become a firm opponent of socialism. Burns encouraged a campaign of propaganda to discredit the principle of labour colonies, which were presented as money-wasting ventures that pampered idlers and scroungers. A formal enquiry revealed irregularities in the operation of the scheme, though it exonerated Lansbury. He retained the confidence of his electorate and was easily re-elected to the Board of Guardians in 1907.\n\nIn 1905 Lansbury was appointed to a Royal Commission on the Poor Laws, which deliberated for four years. Lansbury, together with Beatrice Webb of the Fabian Society, argued for the complete abolition of the Poor Laws and their replacement by a system that incorporated old age pensions, a minimum wage, and national and local public works projects. These proposals were embodied at the commission's conclusion in a minority report signed by Lansbury and Webb; the majority report was, according to Postgate, \"an ill-considered jumble of suggestions ... so preposterously inadequate that no attempts were ever made to implement it.\" Most of the minority's recommendations in time became national policy; the Poor Laws were finally abolished by the Local Government Act 1929.\n\n ## National prominence\n\n","h_score":1897911.64375,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":166964,"revid":1164688269,"description":"British politician and reformer (1859\u20131940)","categories":["1859 births","1940 deaths","Anglican pacifists","Anglican socialists","Chairs of the Labour Party (UK)","Councillors in Greater London","Deaths from cancer in England","Deaths from stomach cancer","English Christian pacifists","English Christian socialists","English feminists","English reformers","English republicans","English socialist feminists","European democratic socialists","Independent Labour Party National Administrative Committee members","Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies","Labour Party (UK) mayors","Lansbury family","Leaders of the Labour Party (UK)","Leaders of the Opposition (United Kingdom)","Male feminists","Members of London County Council","Members of Poplar Metropolitan Borough Council","Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom","Parliamentary Peace Aims Group","People from Halesworth","Social Democratic Federation members","Transport and General Workers' Union-sponsored MPs","UK MPs 1910\u20131918","UK MPs 1922\u20131923","UK MPs 1923\u20131924","UK MPs 1924\u20131929","UK MPs 1929\u20131931","UK MPs 1931\u20131935","UK MPs 1935\u20131945"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### George Lansbury: The Fiery Pacifist of British Socialism\n\nIn the annals of Labour's history, George Lansbury emerges as a whirlwind of conviction, leading the party from 1932 to 1935 while championing peace amid global turmoil.

This was his first campaign based on women's rights since the LCC election of 1889. He had been recommended to the constituency by Joseph Fels, who agreed to meet his expenses. The local ILP leadership was committed by an electoral pact to support the Liberal candidate, and could not endorse Lansbury, who secured less than 9 per cent of the vote. The campaign had been managed by Marion Coates Hansen, a prominent local suffragist. Under Hansen's influence Lansbury took up the cause of \"votes for women\"; he allied himself with the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), the more militant of the main suffragist organisations, and became a close associate of Emmeline Pankhurst and her family. The Liberal government elected in 1906 with a large majority showed little interest in the issue of women's suffrage; when they lost their parliamentary majority in the general election of January 1910 they were dependent on the votes of the 40-odd Labour members. To Lansbury's dismay, Labour did not use this leverage to promote votes for women, instead giving the government virtually unqualified support to keep the Conservatives out of power. Lansbury had failed to win election as Labour's candidate at Bow and Bromley in January 1910; however, the continuing political crisis which developed from David Lloyd George's controversial 1909 \"People's Budget\" led to another general election in December 1910. Lansbury again fought Bow and Bromley, and this time was successful. Lansbury found little support in his fight for women's suffrage from his parliamentary Labour colleagues, whom he dismissed as \"a weak, flabby lot\". In parliament, he denounced the prime minister, H. H. Asquith, for the cruelties being inflicted on imprisoned suffragists: \"You are beneath contempt ... you ought to be driven from public life\". He was temporarily suspended from the House for \"disorderly conduct\". In October 1912, aware of the unbridgeable gap between his own position and that of his Labour colleagues, Lansbury resigned his seat to fight a by-election in Bow and Bromley on the specific issue of women's suffrage. The suffragettes sent Grace Roe to help with the campaign. He lost to his Conservative opponent, who campaigned on the slogan \"No Petticoat Government\". Commenting on the result, the Labour MP Will Thorne opined that no constituency could ever be won on the single question of votes for women. Out of parliament, on 26 April 1913 Lansbury addressed a WSPU rally at the Albert Hall, and openly defended violent methods: \"Let them burn and destroy property and do anything they will, and for every leader that is taken away, let a dozen step forward in their place\". For this, Lansbury was charged with incitement, convicted and, after the dismissal of an appeal, sentenced to three months' imprisonment. He immediately went on hunger strike, and was released after four days; although liable to rearrest under the so-called \"Cat and Mouse Act\", he was thereafter left at liberty. In the autumn of 1913, at the invitation of Fels, Lansbury and his wife travelled to America and Canada for an extended holiday. On his return, he devoted his main efforts to the recently founded newspaper, the Daily Herald.","h_score":1897911.64375,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":166964,"revid":1164688269,"description":"British politician and reformer (1859\u20131940)","categories":["1859 births","1940 deaths","Anglican pacifists","Anglican socialists","Chairs of the Labour Party (UK)","Councillors in Greater London","Deaths from cancer in England","Deaths from stomach cancer","English Christian pacifists","English Christian socialists","English feminists","English reformers","English republicans","English socialist feminists","European democratic socialists","Independent Labour Party National Administrative Committee members","Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies","Labour Party (UK) mayors","Lansbury family","Leaders of the Labour Party (UK)","Leaders of the Opposition (United Kingdom)","Male feminists","Members of London County Council","Members of Poplar Metropolitan Borough Council","Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom","Parliamentary Peace Aims Group","People from Halesworth","Social Democratic Federation members","Transport and General Workers' Union-sponsored MPs","UK MPs 1910\u20131918","UK MPs 1922\u20131923","UK MPs 1923\u20131924","UK MPs 1924\u20131929","UK MPs 1929\u20131931","UK MPs 1931\u20131935","UK MPs 1935\u20131945"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 10\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

In the general election of November 1935 he kept his seat at Bow and Bromley; Labour, now led by Attlee, improved its parliamentary representation to 154. Lansbury devoted himself entirely to the cause of world peace, a quest that took him, in 1936, to the United States. He addressed large crowds in 27 cities before meeting President Roosevelt in Washington to present his proposals for a world peace conference. In 1937 he toured Europe, visiting leaders in Belgium, France and Scandinavia, and in April secured a private meeting with Hitler. No official report of the discussion was issued, but Lansbury's personal memorandum indicates that Hitler expressed willingness to join in a world conference if Roosevelt would convene it. Later that year Lansbury met Mussolini in Rome; he described the Italian leader as \"a mixture of Lloyd George, Stanley Baldwin and Winston Churchill\". Lansbury wrote several accounts of his peace journeys, notably My Quest for Peace (1938). His mild and optimistic impressions of the European dictators were widely criticised as na\u00efve and out of touch; some British pacifists were dismayed at Lansbury's meeting with Hitler, while the Daily Worker accused him of diverting attention from the aggressive realities of fascist policies. Lansbury continued to meet European leaders through 1938 and 1939, and was nominated, unsuccessfully, for the 1940 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nAt home, Lansbury served a second term as Mayor of Poplar, in 1936\u201337. He argued against direct confrontation with Mosley's Blackshirts during the October 1936 demonstrations known as the Battle of Cable Street. In October 1937 he became president of the Peace Pledge Union, and a year later he welcomed the Munich Agreement as a step towards peace. During this period he worked on behalf of refugees from Nazi Germany, and was chairman of the Polish Refugee Fund which provided relief to displaced Jewish children. On 3 September 1939, after Neville Chamberlain's announcement of war with Germany, Lansbury addressed the House of Commons. Observing that the cause to which he had dedicated his life was going down in ruins, he added: \"I hope that out of this terrible calamity will arise a spirit that will compel people to give up the reliance on force.\"\n\nEarly in 1940 Lansbury's health began to fail; although unaware, he was suffering from stomach cancer. In an article published in the socialist magazine Tribune, published on 25 April 1940, he made a final statement of his Christian pacifism: \"I hold fast to the truth that this world is big enough for all, that we are all brethren, children of one Father\". Lansbury died on 7 May 1940, at the Manor House Hospital in Golders Green. His funeral in St Mary's Church, Bow, was followed by cremation at Ilford Crematorium, before a memorial service in Westminster Abbey. His ashes were scattered at sea, in accordance with the wish expressed in his will: \"I desire this because although I love England very dearly ... I am a convinced internationalist\".\n\n","h_score":1897911.64375,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":166964,"revid":1164688269,"description":"British politician and reformer (1859\u20131940)","categories":["1859 births","1940 deaths","Anglican pacifists","Anglican socialists","Chairs of the Labour Party (UK)","Councillors in Greater London","Deaths from cancer in England","Deaths from stomach cancer","English Christian pacifists","English Christian socialists","English feminists","English reformers","English republicans","English socialist feminists","European democratic socialists","Independent Labour Party National Administrative Committee members","Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies","Labour Party (UK) mayors","Lansbury family","Leaders of the Labour Party (UK)","Leaders of the Opposition (United Kingdom)","Male feminists","Members of London County Council","Members of Poplar Metropolitan Borough Council","Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom","Parliamentary Peace Aims Group","People from Halesworth","Social Democratic Federation members","Transport and General Workers' Union-sponsored MPs","UK MPs 1910\u20131918","UK MPs 1922\u20131923","UK MPs 1923\u20131924","UK MPs 1924\u20131929","UK MPs 1929\u20131931","UK MPs 1931\u20131935","UK MPs 1935\u20131945"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 10\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

With his PhD complete, although it was not formally accepted until January 12, 1933, he accepted an offer from Ernest Lawrence at the University of California, Berkeley, to join the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, which Lawrence had founded the year before. McMillan's initial work there involved attempting to measure the magnetic moment of the proton, but Otto Stern and Immanuel Estermann were able to carry out these measurements first.\n\nThe main focus of the Radiation laboratory at this time was the development of the cyclotron, and McMillan, who was appointed to the faculty at Berkeley as an instructor in 1935, soon became involved in the effort. His skill with instrumentation came to the fore, and he contributed improvements to the cyclotron. In particular, he helped develop the process of \"shimming\", adjusting the cyclotron to produce a homogeneous magnetic field. Working with M. Stanley Livingston, he discovered oxygen-15, an isotope of oxygen that emits positrons. To produce it, they bombarded nitrogen gas with deuterons. This was mixed with hydrogen and oxygen to produce water, which was then collected with hygroscopic calcium chloride. Radioactivity was found concentrated in it, proving that it was in the oxygen. This was followed by an investigation of the absorption of gamma rays produced by bombarding fluorine with protons.\n\nIn 1935, McMillan, Lawrence and Robert Thornton carried out cyclotron experiments with deuteron beams that produced a series of unexpected results. Deuterons fused with a target nuclei, transmuting the target to a heavier isotope while ejecting a proton. Their experiments indicated a nuclear interaction at lower energies than would be expected from a simple calculation of the Coulomb barrier between a deuteron and a target nucleus.

In November 1940, he began working at the MIT Radiation Laboratory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he participated in the development and testing of airborne microwave radar during World War II. He conducted tests in April 1941 with the radar operating from an old Douglas B-18 Bolo medium bomber. Flying over the Naval Submarine Base New London with Luis Walter Alvarez and Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding, they showed that the radar was able to detect the conning tower of a partly submerged submarine. McMillan married Elsie Walford Blumer in New Haven, Connecticut, on June 7, 1941. Her father was George Blumer, Dean Emeritus of the Yale Medical School. Her sister Mary was Lawrence's wife. The McMillans had three children: Ann Bradford, David Mattison and Stephen Walker. McMillan joined the Navy Radio and Sound Laboratory near San Diego in August 1941. There he worked on a device called a polyscope. The idea, which came from Lawrence, was to use sonar to build up a visual image of the surrounding water. This proved to be far more difficult that doing so with radar, because of objects in the water and variations in water temperature that caused variations in the speed of sound. The polyscope proved to be impractical, and was abandoned. He also, however, developed a sonar training device for submariners, for which he received a patent. Oppenheimer recruited McMillan to join the Manhattan Project, the wartime effort to create atomic bombs, in September 1942. Initially, he commuted back and forth between San Diego, where his family was, and Berkeley. In November he accompanied Oppenheimer on a trip to New Mexico on which the Los Alamos Ranch School was selected as the site of the project's weapons research laboratory, which became the Los Alamos Laboratory. With Oppenheimer and John H. Manley, he drew up the specifications for the new laboratory's technical buildings. He recruited personnel for the laboratory, including Richard Feynman and Robert R. Wilson, established the test area known as the Anchor Ranch, and scoured the country for technical equipment from machine tools to a cyclotron. As the laboratory took shape, McMillan became deputy head of the gun-type nuclear weapon effort under Navy Captain William S. Parsons, an ordnance expert. The plutonium gun, codenamed Thin Man, needed a muzzle velocity of at least 3,000 feet (910 m) per second, which they hoped to achieve with a modified Navy 3-inch antiaircraft gun. The alternative was to build an implosion-type nuclear weapon. McMillan took an early interest in this, watching tests of this concept conducted by Seth Neddermeyer. The results were not encouraging. Simple explosions resulted in distorted shapes. John von Neumann looked at the implosion program in September 1943, and proposed a radical solution involving explosive lenses. This would require expertise in explosives, and McMillan urged Oppenheimer to bring in George Kistiakowsky. Kistiakowsky joined the laboratory on February 16, 1944, and Parsons's E (Explosives) Division was divided in two, with McMillan as deputy for the gun and Kistiakowsky as deputy for implosion. McMillan heard disturbing news in April 1944, and drove out to Pajarito Canyon to confer with Segr\u00e8. Segr\u00e8's group had tested samples of plutonium bred in the Manhattan Project's nuclear reactors and found that it contained quantities of plutonium-240, an isotope that caused spontaneous fission, making Thin Man impractical. In July 1944, Oppenheimer reorganised the laboratory to make an all-out effort on implosion. McMillan remained in charge of the gun-type weapon, which would now be used only with uranium-235. This being the case, Thin Man was replaced by a new, scaled-back design called Little Boy. McMillan was also involved with the implosion as the head of the G-3 Group within the G (Gadget) Division, which was responsible for obtaining measurements and timings on implosion, and served as the laboratory's liaison with Project Camel, the aerial test program being carried out by Caltech. On July 16, 1945, he was present at the Trinity nuclear test, when the first implosion bomb was successfully detonated.","h_score":1893881.2562500001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":157241,"revid":1172537702,"description":"American physicist (1907\u20131991)","categories":["1907 births","1991 deaths","20th-century American chemists","American Nobel laureates","Atoms for Peace Award recipients","California Institute of Technology alumni","Manhattan Project people","Members of the American Philosophical Society","Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences","National Medal of Science laureates","Nobel laureates in Chemistry","Pasadena High School (California) alumni","People associated with CERN","People from Los Alamos, New Mexico","People from Redondo Beach, California","Princeton University alumni","Rare earth scientists","Scientists from Pasadena, California","University of California, Berkeley faculty"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Edwin McMillan?  \nA1: Edwin McMillan was an American physicist and chemist, a pioneer in nuclear science.  \n\nQ2: When and where was he born?  \nA2: Born in 1907 in Redondo Beach, California, he grew up in a curious era of scientific discovery.  \n\nQ3: What was his early education?  \nA3: He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, earning degrees that sparked his atomic research passion.  \n\nQ4: What major discovery did he make?  \nA4: McMillan discovered neptunium, the first transuranic element, by bombarding uranium with neutrons in a lab breakthrough.  \n\nQ5: Did he win any awards?  \nA5: Yes, he shared the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for creating transuranic elements, a glittering scientific crown.  \n\nQ6: How did his work impact science?  \nA6: His research advanced nuclear energy and weapons, opening doors to element synthesis with profound global ripples.  \n\nQ7: What challenges did he face?  \nA7: Amid World War II, secrecy and ethical dilemmas shadowed his Manhattan Project involvement, testing his resolve.  \n\nQ8: What is his legacy today?  \nA8: McMillan's innovations inspire modern particle physics, leaving a lasting atomic legacy in labs worldwide."}

He bombarded it with neutrons produced in the Radiation Laboratory's 37-inch (94 cm) cyclotron through bombarding beryllium with deuterons. In addition to the nuclear fission products reported by Hahn and Strassmann, they detected two unusual radioactive isotopes, one with a half-life of about 2.3 days, and the other with one of around 23 minutes. McMillan identified the short-lived isotope as uranium-239, which had been reported by Hahn and Strassmann. McMillan suspected that the other was an isotope of a new, undiscovered element, with an atomic number of 93. At the time it was believed that element 93 would have similar chemistry to rhenium, so he began working with Emilio Segr\u00e8, an expert on that element from his discovery of its homolog technetium. Both scientists began their work using the prevailing theory, but Segr\u00e8 rapidly determined that McMillan's sample was not at all similar to rhenium. Instead, when he reacted it with hydrogen fluoride (HF) with a strong oxidizing agent present, it behaved like members of the rare-earth elements. Since these comprise a large percentage of fission products, Segr\u00e8 and McMillan decided that the half-life must have been simply another fission product, titling the article \"An Unsuccessful Search for Transuranium Elements\". McMillan realized that his 1939 work with Segr\u00e8 had failed to test the chemical reactions of the radioactive source with sufficient rigor. In a new experiment, McMillan tried subjecting the unknown substance to HF in the presence of a reducing agent, something he had not done before. This reaction resulted in the sample precipitating with the HF, an action that definitively ruled out the possibility that the unknown substance was a rare earth. In May 1940, Philip Abelson from the Carnegie Institute in Washington, DC, who had independently also attempted to separate the isotope with the 2.3-day half-life, visited Berkeley for a short vacation, and they began to collaborate. Abelson observed that the isotope with the 2.3-day half-life did not have chemistry like any known element, but was more similar to uranium than a rare earth. This allowed the source to be isolated and later, in 1945, led to the classification of the actinide series. As a final step, McMillan and Abelson prepared a much larger sample of bombarded uranium that had a prominent 23-minute half-life from <sup>239<\/sup>U and demonstrated conclusively that the unknown 2.3-day half-life increased in strength in concert with a decrease in the 23-minute activity through the following reaction: {}^{238}\\_{92}U + {}^{1}\\_{0}n -\\> {}^{239}\\_{92}U -\\>[\\beta^-][23\\\\ \\ce{min}] \\overset{neptunium}{^{239}\\_{93}Np} -\\>[\\beta^-][2.355\\\\ \\ce{days}] {}^{239}\\_{94}Pu This proved that the unknown radioactive source originated from the decay of uranium and, coupled with the previous observation that the source was different chemically from all known elements, proved beyond all doubt that a new element had been discovered. McMillan and Abelson published their results in an article entitled Radioactive Element 93 in the Physical Review on May 27, 1940. They did not propose a name for the element in the article, but they soon decided on \"neptunium\", since uranium had been named after the planet Uranus, and Neptune is the next planet beyond in our solar system. McMillan suddenly departed for war-related work at this point, leaving Glenn Seaborg to pursue this line of research and discover the second transuranium element, plutonium. In 1951, McMillan shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Seaborg \"for their discoveries in the chemistry of the transuranium elements\".","h_score":1893881.2562500001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":157241,"revid":1172537702,"description":"American physicist (1907\u20131991)","categories":["1907 births","1991 deaths","20th-century American chemists","American Nobel laureates","Atoms for Peace Award recipients","California Institute of Technology alumni","Manhattan Project people","Members of the American Philosophical Society","Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences","National Medal of Science laureates","Nobel laureates in Chemistry","Pasadena High School (California) alumni","People associated with CERN","People from Los Alamos, New Mexico","People from Redondo Beach, California","Princeton University alumni","Rare earth scientists","Scientists from Pasadena, California","University of California, Berkeley faculty"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade 10\n\n**Learning Objectives:**  \n1.

He won his first three matches to face rival Nishikori in the fourth round. On the morning of September 2, Raonic and Nishikori tied the all-time latest finish for a match at the US Open, ending at 2:26 a.m. This tied previous matches between Mats Wilander and Mikael Pernfors in 1993, and between Isner and Philipp Kohlschreiber in 2012. The five set match lasted 4 hours and 19 minutes, with Raonic losing and Nishikori advancing to the quarterfinals. In October, Raonic reached the final of the Japan Open for the third consecutive year, but lost to Nishikori again. Three years prior, in 2011, Raonic had set a personal goal of reaching the year-end ATP Finals, where only the top eight players earned a spot. Heading into the last ATP 1000 event of 2014, the Paris Masters, Raonic trailed Ferrer for the eighth spot, and needed a deep run to surpass him. He beat Sock and Roberto Bautista Agut to set up a quarterfinals match against No. 2 Federer, who had beaten him in all six previous meetings. Needing a win to avoid being eliminated from contention for the ATP Finals, Raonic won in straight sets. His victory was hailed as \"a career-defining win.\" In the post-match interview, Raonic was asked to rank this victory in his career. He replied: \"Considering all the circumstances around it, I think this was the biggest win for me.\" He went on to beat No. 5 Berdych in the semifinals to earn a spot in the second ATP 1000 final of his career. He lost to Djokovic in the final, but secured his place in the 2014 ATP Finals. He is the first Canadian to reach the ATP Finals, and the first player born in the 1990s to do so. Anticlimactically, Raonic withdrew from the tournament due to a leg-muscle tear prior to his match against Nishikori, after losses to Federer and Murray. Raonic ended the year at a career-high season-ending ranking of No. 8.He was one of just three players to reach the quarterfinals or better at seven of the nine ATP 1000 tournaments. Raonic finished with a career-high total of 1107 aces in 2014. At the time, this was the fifth highest single-year ace total in history.

Two years later, in October 2005, he picked up his first singles match victory at age 14. His first juniors titles in both singles and doubles came at the same Grade 4 tournament in October 2006. Later that year, he won the Prince Cup doubles title, partnering fellow Canadian Vasek Pospisil for the first time at an ITF event. Pospisil and Raonic partnered at four more junior tournaments, including the 2008 Wimbledon Championships and the 2008 French Open, reaching the semifinals in the latter. His most notable titles as a junior were in doubles, winning two Grade 1 events in 2008 partnered with Bradley Klahn. Over five years, Raonic compiled a 53\u201330 win\u2013loss record in singles, and a 56\u201324 record in doubles on the ITF Junior Circuit. Except for reaching the semifinals at the 2008 French Open in doubles, Raonic did not advance past the second round of junior Grand Slam events. His career-high combined junior ranking, which considers both singles and doubles results, was No. 35.While an amateur, Raonic played in fourteen professional tournaments against adults in North America: ten ITF Futures events at the bottom tier of professional tennis; three ATP Challenger Tour events at the middle tier; and one ATP World Tour event at the top tier. He played his first professional circuit match in the qualifying draw of an ITF Futures tournament in Toronto in October 2005 at the age of 14; he won his first professional circuit main draw match at an ITF Futures tournament in Gatineau, Quebec, in March 2007 against Fabrice Martin. With the win, Raonic earned his first world ranking of No. 1518.He played his first professional circuit doubles match at the same tournament, partnered with Pospisil again. Raonic lost his first ATP Challenger Tour match in Granby, Quebec, in July 2007 against Gary Lugassy. Raonic won his first ITF Futures doubles title in Gatineau, Quebec in March 2008, and reached his first ITF Futures singles final two weeks later in Sherbrooke, Quebec. He received a wildcard to the qualifying tournament of the 2008 Canadian Open, but lost in the first round to Alexander Kudryavtsev. The match was his first in the ATP World Tour. By the summer of 2008, Raonic had received scholarship offers from several colleges, including the University of Michigan, Princeton, and Northwestern University, and committed to play for the University of Virginia that fall while studying finance. Just two weeks before school started, he consulted his parents about his plan to turn professional instead. Raonic and his parents agreed that he would take correspondence courses in finance from Athabasca University while starting a professional tennis career, setting a deadline of two years for reaching the top 100. During that summer, his world ranking ranged between No. 915 and No. 937.Raonic reached the top 100 in January 2011, around five months later than the target deadline. He thus turned down the scholarships and turned professional, agreeing to be represented by the sports agency SFX. University of Virginia men's tennis coach Brian Boland later commented that \"I have only seen two guys turn down scholarships and then succeed quickly on the Tour: Sam Querrey and Milos Raonic.\"","h_score":1813544.6312500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":26431480,"revid":1173819177,"description":"Canadian tennis player (born 1990)","categories":["1990 births","Canadian expatriate sportspeople in Monaco","Canadian expatriate sportspeople in Spain","Canadian humanitarians","Canadian male tennis players","Canadian people of Montenegrin descent","Canadian people of Serbian descent","Canadian television sportscasters","Living people","Montenegrin emigrants to Canada","Naturalized citizens of Canada","Olympic tennis players for Canada","People from Monte Carlo","People from Thornhill, Ontario","Racket sportspeople from Ontario","Serb diaspora sportspeople","Serbs of Montenegro","Sportspeople from Podgorica","Sportspeople from the Regional Municipality of York","Tennis commentators","Tennis players at the 2012 Summer Olympics","Yugoslav emigrants to Canada"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Milos Raonic: Canadian Tennis Powerhouse\n\nMilos Raonic is a professional tennis player from Canada, celebrated for his powerful serve and top-10 rankings.

He lost to No. 2 Federer in three sets, with Federer recording his 1,000th match win on the professional tour. Later in the month, he reached the quarterfinals of the Australian Open after beating No. 12 Feliciano L\u00f3pez. He lost to Djokovic in straight sets. At the Indian Wells Masters, Raonic won his quarterfinal match against No. 3 Nadal, after saving three match points from Nadal in the second set tiebreak. It was Raonic's first career victory over Nadal after five defeats. He lost to Federer in the semifinals. In April, Raonic opened the Monte-Carlo Masters with a victory over Jo\u00e3o Sousa. Just one game into his second-round match against Tommy Robredo, Raonic called for a medical timeout due to a right foot injury. Although he went on to win the match, Raonic's manager indicated that Raonic had made a pre-existing injury worse by playing. In his quarterfinal match against Berdych, he complained of numbness in his right foot during a medical timeout, and retired while trailing 2\u20135 in the opening set. It was diagnosed as a pinched nerve, and Raonic was expected to be healthy for the Madrid Open. In Madrid, Raonic advanced to the quarterfinals with straight sets victories over M\u00f3naco and Leonardo Mayer. After Raonic lost in the quarterfinals against Murray, Murray observed that Raonic was \"struggling [with injury].\" Following the match, Raonic announced that he would undergo surgery to repair a nerve in his foot, targeting a return in time for the French Open. Ironically, Raonic's world ranking reached a new career-high of No. 4 the following week, the highest by a Canadian man or woman. Following surgery, Raonic withdrew from the Italian Open and the French Open. He returned in time for the grass court season. Having played in Halle in previous years, Raonic elected to play at the Queen's Club Championships for the first time. Raonic lost in the quarterfinals in his Queen's debut, and lost in the third round at Wimbledon. After his Wimbledon loss to Kyrgios, Raonic commented that his foot injury had led to problems throughout his body: \"There wasn't a place it wasn't [bothering me]... First ankle, then the hip, and then the back. Then when those things aren't working, you just put too much pressure on your shoulder, and then your shoulder hurts.\" The cascading injuries led to a withdrawal from Canada's Davis Cup tie against Belgium; a withdrawal from the Washington Open, where Raonic was the defending champion; first round losses at the Canadian Open and Cincinnati Masters; and a third round loss at the US Open to L\u00f3pez. In September, at the St. Petersburg Open, Raonic won his seventh singles title\u2014and first in Europe\u2014with a three-set victory over Sousa. His serve was broken just once in the entire tournament. After early losses at the China Open and Shanghai Masters, Raonic ended his ATP season by withdrawing from three consecutive tournaments, citing injury. On November 2, he fell outside the top 10, dropping to No. 14.After six weeks off, Raonic joined the Philippine Mavericks of the exhibition International Premier Tennis League (IPTL) in December. After four matches, he withdrew due to back spasms. In late November, Raonic parted ways with both Ljubi\u010di\u0107, who had been his coach since June 2013, and Austin Nunn, who had been his media manager for nearly four years. Ljubi\u010di\u0107 was added to Federer's coaching team two weeks later. Raonic contacted former No. 1 tennis player Carlos Moy\u00e1 about a coaching relationship, and they trained together and had discussions during the IPTL events. The relationship was subsequently formalized and on January 1, 2016, Raonic announced that Moy\u00e1 would join his coaching team alongside Piatti. Raonic said that he chose Moy\u00e1 for three reasons: \"Carlos is very laid back and positive [... and] he communicates well.\"","h_score":1813544.6312500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":26431480,"revid":1173819177,"description":"Canadian tennis player (born 1990)","categories":["1990 births","Canadian expatriate sportspeople in Monaco","Canadian expatriate sportspeople in Spain","Canadian humanitarians","Canadian male tennis players","Canadian people of Montenegrin descent","Canadian people of Serbian descent","Canadian television sportscasters","Living people","Montenegrin emigrants to Canada","Naturalized citizens of Canada","Olympic tennis players for Canada","People from Monte Carlo","People from Thornhill, Ontario","Racket sportspeople from Ontario","Serb diaspora sportspeople","Serbs of Montenegro","Sportspeople from Podgorica","Sportspeople from the Regional Municipality of York","Tennis commentators","Tennis players at the 2012 Summer Olympics","Yugoslav emigrants to Canada"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Milos Raonic: The Canadian Serve Sensation\n\nCanadian tennis star Milos Raonic is celebrated for his thunderous serves and Grand Slam near-victories.

He sustained an ankle injury that kept him out of action for six weeks. From March through May, Raonic improved on his career-best performance at five consecutive ATP 1000 events. At the Indian Wells Masters, he beat No. 6 Murray to reach the quarterfinals, losing to Alexandr Dolgopolov. He lost in the quarterfinals of the Miami Masters to Nadal. He reached the quarterfinals for the third ATP 1000 tournament in a row at the Monte-Carlo Masters, before falling to Wawrinka. The result garnered Raonic a career-high ranking as world No. 9.Raonic lost in the third round of the Madrid Open to Nishikori. At the Italian Open, Raonic defeated J\u00e9r\u00e9my Chardy in the quarterfinals to reach his first Masters 1000 semifinal on clay. After winning the first set, he lost his semifinal match to eventual champion Djokovic. Although he had played Djokovic in the 2013 Davis Cup, this was their first ATP match against one another. At the French Open, Raonic was seeded in the top eight for the first time at a Grand Slam tournament. He notched victories against Nick Kyrgios, Ji\u0159\u00ed Vesel\u00fd, Gilles Simon, and Marcel Granollers to reach the quarterfinals of a major for the first time in his career, becoming the first Canadian man to do so in the Open Era. He lost in the quarterfinals to Djokovic in straight sets. After the match, Raonic commented: \"I've gone farther in a Slam than I have before and I've learned things even from this loss.\" At Wimbledon, Raonic was again seeded eighth. He defeated Matthew Ebden, Jack Sock, \u0141ukasz Kubot, Nishikori, and Kyrgios to reach his first major semifinal. He became the first Canadian men's singles player to reach the semifinals at a major since Robert Powell in 1908. In the quarterfinal victory against Kyrgios, Raonic tied a career-high with 39 aces. In the semifinals, Raonic lost to Federer in straight sets. After the match, Raonic reflected: \"There's a lot of good things to take from it. ... But when you get here to this point, I think it's just human nature, the greed of human nature, that you want so much more. You feel it in front of you and you want to grab it.\" Despite the loss, Raonic saw his world ranking improve to a career-high No. 6.In his next tournament, Raonic reached his first final of the year at the Washington Open, facing Pospisil in the first all-Canadian final in ATP history. Raonic won the title in straight sets. It was his first ATP 500 title, after finishing as runner-up in four previous ATP 500 tournaments.

Raonic began the grass court season by advancing to his first grass court final at the Queen's Club Championships without dropping serve in victories over Kyrgios, Vesel\u00fd, Bautista Agut, and Tomic, but lost the final in three sets to Murray. At Wimbledon, Raonic won his first three matches in straight sets against Pablo Carre\u00f1o Busta, Andreas Seppi, and Sock. In the fourth round against Goffin, Raonic came back from a two set deficit to win in five sets for the first time in his career. In ten previous best-of-five matches where he lost the first two sets, he also lost the third set. Raonic then beat Querrey in the quarterfinals and Federer in the semifinals, marking Federer's first defeat in 11 Wimbledon semifinals. With the victory, Raonic reached his first Grand Slam final, matching Greg Rusedski. In the final, he lost to Murray in straight sets, though he made the fastest serve of the tournament at 147 miles per hour (237 km\/h). With the transition to hard courts after Wimbledon, Raonic made the quarterfinals of the Canadian Open, losing to Monfils, before falling to Murray for the fifth time in 2016 in the Cincinnati Masters semifinal. Raonic was the fifth seed at the US Open, but lost in the second round to Ryan Harrison, partly due to debilitating cramps. In September, cramps were cited as the reason for Raonic to miss Canada's Davis Cup tie against Chile. Later that month, Raonic failed to defend his title at the St. Petersburg Open, falling in his opening match to Youzhny. Raonic withdrew from the China Open prior to his semifinal match due to an ankle injury sustained in the quarterfinal. With the result, Raonic qualified for the ATP World Tour Finals for the second time. Raonic suffered another injury, a quadriceps tear, during his quarterfinal match against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the Paris Masters and withdrew before his scheduled semifinal against Murray. At the ATP World Tour Finals, Raonic lost to Djokovic, but beat Monfils and Thiem in round robin play to qualify for his first Tour Finals semifinal. He lost the semifinal match to Murray in 3 hours and 38 minutes, the longest match on the ATP Tour in 2016 and the longest match in World Tour Finals history. Raonic rose to a career-high No. 3, finishing the year behind only Murray and Djokovic.

In 1961, he agreed to appear in an advertisement for MONY (Mutual of New York) as long as he had final approval. With the money from Screen Gems and other works, he and Eileen moved to 539 South Beverly Glen, near Beverly Hills. He discussed an idea about a multi-ethnic crew on an airship traveling the world, based on the film Master of the World (1961), with fellow writer Christopher Knopf at MGM. As the time was not right for science fiction, he began work on The Lieutenant for Arena Productions. This made it to the NBC Saturday night lineup at 7:30 pm and premiered on September 14, 1963. The show set a new ratings record for the time slot. Roddenberry worked with several cast and crew who would later join him on Star Trek, including Gene L. Coon, star Gary Lockwood, Joe D'Agosta, Leonard Nimoy, Nichelle Nichols, and Majel Barrett. The Lieutenant was produced with the co-operation of the Pentagon, which allowed them to film at an actual Marine base. During the production of the series Roddenberry clashed regularly with the Department of Defense over potential plots. The department withdrew its support after Roddenberry pressed ahead with a plot titled \"To Set It Right\" in which a white and a black man find a common cause in their roles as Marines. \"To Set It Right\" was the first time he worked with Nichols, and it was her first television role. The episode has been preserved at the Museum of Television and Radio in New York City. The show was not renewed after its first season. Roddenberry was already working on a new series idea. This included his ship location from Hawaii Passage and added a Horatio Hornblower character, plus the multiracial crew from his airship idea. He decided to write it as science fiction, and by March 11, 1964, he brought together a 16-page pitch. On April 24, he sent three copies and two dollars () to the Writers Guild of America to register his series. He called it Star Trek.","h_score":1932848.4812500002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":13148,"revid":1172136154,"description":"American screenwriter and producer (1921\u20131991)","categories":["1921 births","1991 deaths","20th-century American businesspeople","20th-century American male writers","20th-century American novelists","20th-century American screenwriters","20th-century pseudonymous writers","American humanists","American male novelists","American male screenwriters","American male television writers","American science fiction writers","American television writers","Commercial aviators","Critics of religions","Film producers from California","Film producers from New Jersey","Film producers from Texas","Former Baptists","Gene Roddenberry","Hugo Award-winning writers","Los Angeles City College alumni","Los Angeles Police Department officers","Mass media people from El Paso, Texas","Military personnel from Texas","Novelists from New Jersey","People from River Edge, New Jersey","Recipients of the Air Medal","Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)","Science Fiction Hall of Fame inductees","Screenwriters from California","Screenwriters from Los Angeles","Screenwriters from New Jersey","Screenwriters from Texas","Showrunners","Space burials","Television producers from California","Television producers from New Jersey","Television producers from Texas","United States Army Air Forces bomber pilots of World War II","United States Army Air Forces officers","Writers Guild of America Award winners"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Gene Roddenberry?  \nA1: Gene Roddenberry was an American television writer and producer.

During 1974, Roddenberry reworked the Genesis II concept as a second pilot, Planet Earth, for rival network ABC, with similar less-than-successful results. The pilot was aired on April 23, 1974. While Roddenberry wanted to create something that could feasibly exist in the future, the network wanted stereotypical science-fiction women and were unhappy when that was not delivered. Roddenberry was not involved in a third reworking of the material by ABC that produced Strange New World. He began developing MAGNA I, an underwater science-fiction series, for 20th Century Fox Television. By the time the work on the script was complete, though, those who had approved the project had left Fox and their replacements were not interested in the project. A similar fate was faced by Tribunes, a science-fiction police series, which Roddenberry attempted to get off the ground between 1973 and 1977. He gave up after four years; the series never even reached the pilot stage. In 1974, Roddenberry was paid \\$25,000 by John Whitmore to write a script called The Nine. Intended to be about Andrija Puharich's parapsychological research, it evolved into a frank exploration of his experiences attempting to earn a living attending science fiction conventions. At the time, he was again close to losing his house because of a lack of income. The pilot Spectre, Roddenberry's 1977 attempt to create an occult detective duo similar to Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, was released as a television movie within the United States and received a limited theatrical release in the United Kingdom.","h_score":1932848.4812500002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":13148,"revid":1172136154,"description":"American screenwriter and producer (1921\u20131991)","categories":["1921 births","1991 deaths","20th-century American businesspeople","20th-century American male writers","20th-century American novelists","20th-century American screenwriters","20th-century pseudonymous writers","American humanists","American male novelists","American male screenwriters","American male television writers","American science fiction writers","American television writers","Commercial aviators","Critics of religions","Film producers from California","Film producers from New Jersey","Film producers from Texas","Former Baptists","Gene Roddenberry","Hugo Award-winning writers","Los Angeles City College alumni","Los Angeles Police Department officers","Mass media people from El Paso, Texas","Military personnel from Texas","Novelists from New Jersey","People from River Edge, New Jersey","Recipients of the Air Medal","Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)","Science Fiction Hall of Fame inductees","Screenwriters from California","Screenwriters from Los Angeles","Screenwriters from New Jersey","Screenwriters from Texas","Showrunners","Space burials","Television producers from California","Television producers from New Jersey","Television producers from Texas","United States Army Air Forces bomber pilots of World War II","United States Army Air Forces officers","Writers Guild of America Award winners"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Gene Roddenberry?  \nA1: Gene Roddenberry was an American writer and producer, born in 1921.

While working for Ziv, in 1956, he pitched a series to CBS set aboard a cruise ship, Hawaii Passage, but they did not buy it, as he wanted to become a producer and have full creative control. He wrote another script for Ziv's series Harbourmaster titled \"Coastal Security\" and signed a contract with the company to develop a show called Junior Executive with Quinn Martin. Nothing came of the series. He wrote scripts for a number of other series in his early years as a professional writer, including Bat Masterson and Jefferson Drum. Roddenberry's episode of the series Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel, \"Helen of Abajinian\", won the Writers Guild of America award for Best Teleplay in 1958. He also continued to create series of his own, including a series based on an agent for Lloyd's of London called The Man from Lloyds. He pitched a police-based series called Footbeat to CBS, Hollis Productions, and Screen Gems. It nearly made it into ABC's Sunday-night lineup, but they opted to show only Western series that night. Roddenberry was asked to write a series called Riverboat, set in 1860s Mississippi. When he discovered that the producers wanted no black people on the show, he argued so much with them that he lost the job. He also considered moving to England around this time, as Lew Grade wanted Roddenberry to develop series and set up his own production company. Though he did not move, he leveraged the deal to land a contract with Screen Gems that included a guaranteed \\$100,000, and became a producer for the first time on a summer replacement for The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show titled Wrangler. Screen Gems backed Roddenberry's first attempt at creating a pilot. His series, The Wild Blue, went to pilot, but was not picked up. The three main characters had names that later appeared in the Star Trek franchise: Philip Pike, Edward Jellicoe, and James T. Irvine. While working at Screen Gems, an actress, new to Hollywood, wrote to him asking for a meeting. They quickly became friends and met every few months; the woman was Majel Leigh Hudec, later known as Majel Barrett. He created a second pilot called 333 Montgomery about a lawyer, played by DeForest Kelley. It was not picked up by the network but was later rewritten as a new series called Defiance County. His career with Screen Gems ended in late 1961, and shortly afterward, he had issues with his old friend Erle Stanley Gardner. The Perry Mason creator claimed that Defiance County had infringed his character Doug Selby. The two writers fell out via correspondence and stopped contacting one another, though Defiance County never proceeded past the pilot stage.

In December, he decided to write lyrics to the Star Trek theme; this angered the theme's composer, Alexander Courage, as it meant that royalties would be split between them. In February 1966, NBC informed Desilu that they were buying Star Trek and that it would be included in the fall 1966 television schedule. On May 24, the first episode of the Star Trek series went into production; Desilu was contracted to deliver 13 episodes. Five days before the first broadcast, Roddenberry appeared at the 24th World Science Fiction Convention and previewed \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\". After the episode was shown, he received a standing ovation. The first episode to air on NBC was \"The Man Trap\", on September 8, 1966, at 8:00 pm. Roddenberry was immediately concerned about the series' low ratings and wrote to Harlan Ellison to ask if he could use his name in letters to the network to save the show. Not wanting to lose a potential source of income, Ellison agreed and also sought the help of other writers who also wanted to avoid losing potential income. Roddenberry corresponded with science fiction writer Isaac Asimov about how to address the issue of Spock's growing popularity and the possibility that his character would overshadow Kirk. Asimov suggested having Kirk and Spock work together as a team \"to get people to think of Kirk when they think of Spock.\" The series was renewed by NBC, first for a full season's order, and then for a second season. An article in the Chicago Tribune quoted studio executives as stating that the letter-writing campaign had been wasted because they had already been planning to renew Star Trek. Roddenberry often rewrote submitted scripts, although he did not always take credit for these. Roddenberry and Ellison fell out over \"The City on the Edge of Forever\" after Roddenberry rewrote Ellison's script to make it both financially feasible to film and usable for the series context. Even his close friend Don Ingalls had his script for \"A Private Little War\" altered drastically, and as a result, Ingalls declared that he would only be credited under the pseudonym \"Jud Crucis\" (a play on \"Jesus Christ\"), claiming he had been crucified by the process. Roddenberry's work rewriting \"The Menagerie\", based on footage originally shot for \"The Cage\", resulted in a Writers Guild arbitration board hearing. The Guild ruled in his favor over John D.  F. Black, the complainant. The script won a Hugo Award, but the awards board neglected to inform Roddenberry, who found out through correspondence with Asimov. As the second season was drawing to a close, Roddenberry once again faced the threat of cancellation. He enlisted the help of Asimov, and even encouraged a student-led protest march on NBC. On January 8, 1968, a thousand students from 20 schools marched on the studio. Roddenberry began to communicate with Star Trek fan Bjo Trimble, who led a fan-writing campaign to save the series.","h_score":1932848.4812500002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":13148,"revid":1172136154,"description":"American screenwriter and producer (1921\u20131991)","categories":["1921 births","1991 deaths","20th-century American businesspeople","20th-century American male writers","20th-century American novelists","20th-century American screenwriters","20th-century pseudonymous writers","American humanists","American male novelists","American male screenwriters","American male television writers","American science fiction writers","American television writers","Commercial aviators","Critics of religions","Film producers from California","Film producers from New Jersey","Film producers from Texas","Former Baptists","Gene Roddenberry","Hugo Award-winning writers","Los Angeles City College alumni","Los Angeles Police Department officers","Mass media people from El Paso, Texas","Military personnel from Texas","Novelists from New Jersey","People from River Edge, New Jersey","Recipients of the Air Medal","Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)","Science Fiction Hall of Fame inductees","Screenwriters from California","Screenwriters from Los Angeles","Screenwriters from New Jersey","Screenwriters from Texas","Showrunners","Space burials","Television producers from California","Television producers from New Jersey","Television producers from Texas","United States Army Air Forces bomber pilots of World War II","United States Army Air Forces officers","Writers Guild of America Award winners"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Gene Roddenberry: Visionary Creator of Star Trek\n\nGene Roddenberry was an American writer and producer who created the groundbreaking Star Trek series in the 1960s.

An initial script for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan was circulated to eight people; Bennett attributed the subsequent plot leak of the death of Spock to Roddenberry. About 20% of the plot was based on Roddenberry's ideas. Roddenberry was involved in creating the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation, which premiered with \"Encounter at Farpoint\" on September 28, 1987. He was given a bonus of \\$1 million in addition to a salary to produce the series, and celebrated by purchasing a new Rolls-Royce for \\$100,000. The arrangement did not entitle him to be executive producer of the series. Paramount was already concerned about the original cast not returning, and fearing fan reaction if Roddenberry was not involved, agreed to his demand for control of the show. Roddenberry rewrote the series bible from an original version by David Gerrold, who had previously written The Original Series episode \"The Trouble with Tribbles\", and The Animated Series follow-up, \"More Tribbles, More Troubles\". According to producer Rick Berman, Roddenberry's involvement in The Next Generation \"diminished greatly\" after the first season, but the nature of his increasingly peripheral role was not disclosed because of the value of his name to fans. While Berman said that Roddenberry had \"all but stopped writing and rewriting\" by the end of the third season, his final writing credit on the show (a co-teleplay credit) actually occurred considerably earlier, appearing on \"Datalore\", the 13th episode of the first season. Although commercially successful from its inception, the series was initially marred by Writers Guild of America grievances from Fontana and Gerrold, both of whom left the series in acrimonious circumstances; frequent turnover among the writing staff (24 staff writers left the show during its first three seasons, triple the average attrition rate for such series); and allegations that Roddenberry attorney Leonard Maizlish had become the producer's \"point man and proxy\", ghostwriting memos, sitting in on meetings, and contributing to scripts despite not being on staff. Writer Tracy Torm\u00e9 described the first few seasons of The Next Generation under Roddenberry as an \"insane asylum\". In 1990, Nicholas Meyer was brought in to direct the sixth film in the series: Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. Creatively, Meyer clashed with Roddenberry, who felt that having the Enterprise crew hold prejudices against the Klingons did not fit with his view of the universe. Meyer described a meeting with Roddenberry he later regretted, saying > His guys were lined up on one side of the room, and my guys were lined up on the other side of the room, and this was not a meeting in which I felt I'd behaved very well, very diplomatically. I came out of it feeling not very good, and I've not felt good about it ever since. He was not well, and maybe there were more tactful ways of dealing with it, because at the end of the day, I was going to go out and make the movie. I didn't have to take him on. Not my finest hour. In Joel Engel's biography, Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek, he states that Roddenberry watched The Undiscovered Country alongside the producers of the film at a private screening two days before his death, and told them they had done a \"good job\". In contrast, Nimoy and Shatner's memoirs report that after the screening, Roddenberry called his lawyer and demanded a quarter of the scenes be cut; the producers refused. Roddenberry wrote the novelization of Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Although it has been incorrectly attributed to several other authors (most notably Alan Dean Foster), it was the first in a series of hundreds of Star Trek-based novels to be published by the Pocket Books imprint of Simon & Schuster, whose parent company also owned Paramount Pictures Corporation. Previously, Roddenberry worked intermittently on The God Thing, a proposed novel based upon his rejected 1975 screenplay for a proposed low-budget (\\$3 to \\$5 million) Star Trek film preceding the development of Phase II throughout 1976. Attempts to complete the project by Walter Koenig, Susan Sackett, Fred Bronson, and Michael Jan Friedman have proven to be unfeasible for a variety of legal and structural reasons.","h_score":1932848.4812500002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":13148,"revid":1172136154,"description":"American screenwriter and producer (1921\u20131991)","categories":["1921 births","1991 deaths","20th-century American businesspeople","20th-century American male writers","20th-century American novelists","20th-century American screenwriters","20th-century pseudonymous writers","American humanists","American male novelists","American male screenwriters","American male television writers","American science fiction writers","American television writers","Commercial aviators","Critics of religions","Film producers from California","Film producers from New Jersey","Film producers from Texas","Former Baptists","Gene Roddenberry","Hugo Award-winning writers","Los Angeles City College alumni","Los Angeles Police Department officers","Mass media people from El Paso, Texas","Military personnel from Texas","Novelists from New Jersey","People from River Edge, New Jersey","Recipients of the Air Medal","Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)","Science Fiction Hall of Fame inductees","Screenwriters from California","Screenwriters from Los Angeles","Screenwriters from New Jersey","Screenwriters from Texas","Showrunners","Space burials","Television producers from California","Television producers from New Jersey","Television producers from Texas","United States Army Air Forces bomber pilots of World War II","United States Army Air Forces officers","Writers Guild of America Award winners"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Gene Roddenberry: Architect of the Stars\n\nGene Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek, pioneered science fiction by weaving themes of exploration and unity into mainstream entertainment.

He then went to Desilu Productions, but rather than being offered a one-script deal, he was hired as a producer and allowed to work on his own projects. His first was a half-hour pilot called Police Story (not to be confused with the anthology series created by Joseph Wambaugh), which was not picked up by the networks. Having not sold a pilot in five years, Desilu was having financial difficulties; its only success was The Lucy Show. Roddenberry took the Star Trek idea to Oscar Katz, head of programming, and the duo immediately started work on a plan to sell the series to the networks. They took it to CBS, which ultimately passed on it. The duo later learned that CBS had been eager to find out about Star Trek because it had a science fiction series in development\u2014Lost in Space. Roddenberry and Katz next took the idea to Mort Werner at NBC, this time downplaying the science fiction elements and highlighting the links to Gunsmoke and Wagon Train. The network funded three story ideas and selected \"The Menagerie\", which was later known as \"The Cage\", to be made into a pilot. (The other two later became episodes of the series.) While most of the money for the pilot came from NBC, the remaining costs were covered by Desilu. Roddenberry hired Dorothy Fontana, better known as D.C. Fontana, as his assistant. They had worked together previously on The Lieutenant, and she had eight script credits to her name. Roddenberry and Barrett had begun an affair by the early days of Star Trek, and he specifically wrote the part of the character Number One in the pilot with her in mind; no other actresses were considered for the role. Barrett suggested Nimoy for the part of Spock. He had worked with both Roddenberry and Barrett on The Lieutenant, and once Roddenberry remembered the thin features of the actor, he did not consider anyone else for the part. The remaining cast came together; filming began on November 27, 1964, and was completed on December 11. After post-production, the episode was shown to NBC executives, and it was rumored that Star Trek would be broadcast at 8:00 pm on Friday nights. The episode failed to impress test audiences, and after the executives became hesitant, Katz offered to make a second pilot. On March 26, 1965, NBC ordered a new episode. Roddenberry developed several possible scripts, including \"Mudd's Women\", \"The Omega Glory\", and with the help of Samuel A. Peeples, \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\". NBC selected the last one, leading to later rumors that Peeples created Star Trek, something he always denied. Roddenberry was determined to make the crew racially diverse, which impressed actor George Takei when he came for his audition. The episode went into production on July 15, 1965, and was completed at around half the cost of \"The Cage\", since the sets were already built.","h_score":1932848.4812500002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":13148,"revid":1172136154,"description":"American screenwriter and producer (1921\u20131991)","categories":["1921 births","1991 deaths","20th-century American businesspeople","20th-century American male writers","20th-century American novelists","20th-century American screenwriters","20th-century pseudonymous writers","American humanists","American male novelists","American male screenwriters","American male television writers","American science fiction writers","American television writers","Commercial aviators","Critics of religions","Film producers from California","Film producers from New Jersey","Film producers from Texas","Former Baptists","Gene Roddenberry","Hugo Award-winning writers","Los Angeles City College alumni","Los Angeles Police Department officers","Mass media people from El Paso, Texas","Military personnel from Texas","Novelists from New Jersey","People from River Edge, New Jersey","Recipients of the Air Medal","Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)","Science Fiction Hall of Fame inductees","Screenwriters from California","Screenwriters from Los Angeles","Screenwriters from New Jersey","Screenwriters from Texas","Showrunners","Space burials","Television producers from California","Television producers from New Jersey","Television producers from Texas","United States Army Air Forces bomber pilots of World War II","United States Army Air Forces officers","Writers Guild of America Award winners"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Gene Roddenberry: The Cosmic Dreamweaver Who Boldly Went First\n\nGene Roddenberry created the groundbreaking Star Trek series in the 1960s, blending sci-fi adventure with profound social commentary.

Throughout much of his career, he had routinely used stimulants to work through the night on scripts, especially amphetamines. The effects of these substances were compounded by deleterious interactions with diabetes, high blood pressure, and antidepressant prescriptions. Following a stroke at a family reunion in Tallahassee, Florida, in September 1989, Roddenberry's health declined further, ultimately requiring him to use a wheelchair. His right arm was paralyzed after another stroke in early October 1991, causing him ongoing pain as the muscles began to atrophy. It also caused problems with the sight in his right eye, and he found communicating in full sentences difficult. At 2:00 pm, on October 24, he attended an appointment with his doctor, Dr. Ronald Rich, in Santa Monica, California. He arrived in the building with his staff and began to travel up to the ninth floor in the elevator. As they reached the fifth floor, he began struggling to breathe and was wheeled into the doctor's office, where he was reclined, and a nurse administered oxygen. Barrett was sent for. Upon her arrival, she held Roddenberry while encouraging him to breathe. He suffered cardiopulmonary arrest and died in the doctor's office shortly afterwards. CPR was attempted with no effect, and paramedics arrived to take him across the road to the Santa Monica Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. He was 70 years old. The funeral was arranged for November 1, with the public invited to the memorial service at the Hall of Liberty, within the Forest Lawn Memorial Park, in Hollywood Hills. It was a secular service; Roddenberry had been cremated before the event. More than 300 Star Trek fans attended and stood in the balcony section of the hall, while the invited guests were on the floor level. Nichelle Nichols sang twice during the ceremony, first \"Yesterday\", and then a song she wrote herself titled \"Gene\". Both songs had been requested by Barrett. Several people spoke at the memorial, including Ray Bradbury, Whoopi Goldberg, Christopher Knopf, E. Jack Neuman, and Patrick Stewart. The ceremony was closed by two kilted pipers playing \"Amazing Grace\" as a recorded message by Roddenberry was broadcast. A four-plane flypast, in the missing man formation, followed some 30 minutes later. After his death, Star Trek: The Next Generation aired a two-part episode of season five, called \"Unification\", which featured a dedication to Roddenberry. Roddenberry's will left the majority of his \\$30 million estate to Barrett in a trust. He also left money to his children and his first wife Eileen. However, his daughter Dawn contested the will, on the grounds that Barrett had undue influence on her father. In a hearing held in 1993, the Los Angeles Superior Court ruled that improprieties existed in the management of the trust and removed Barrett as executor. In another decision, the court found that Roddenberry had hidden assets from Star Trek in the Norway Corporation to keep funds away from his first wife, and ordered the payment of 50% of those assets to Eileen, as well as punitive damages. In 1996, the California Court of Appeals ruled that the original will, which stated that anyone who contested it would be disinherited, would stand. As a result, Dawn lost \\$500,000 from the estate, as well as a share of the trust upon Barrett's death. The appellate court also overturned the earlier decision to award Roddenberry's first wife, Eileen, 50% of his assets. The judge called that case one \"that should never have been\". ### Spaceflight\n\nIn 1992, some of Roddenberry's ashes were flown into space, and returned to Earth, on the Space Shuttle Columbia mission STS-52. On April 21, 1997, a Celestis spacecraft with 7 grams (1\u20444 oz) of the cremated remains of Roddenberry, along with those of Timothy Leary, Gerard K. O'Neill and 21 other people, was launched into Earth orbit as part of the Minisat 01 mission aboard a Pegasus XL rocket from a site near the Canary Islands. On May 20, 2002, the spacecraft's orbit deteriorated and it disintegrated in the atmosphere. Another flight to launch more of his ashes into deep space, along with those of Barrett, who died in 2008, was initially planned to take place in 2009. Unlike previous flights, the intention was that this flight would not return to burn up in the Earth's atmosphere. The payload was to include the ashes of James Doohan in addition to the Roddenberry's and several others and was scheduled to fly in 2016 on the Sunjammer solar sail experiment, but the project was canceled in 2014. Celestis rescheduled their launch for 2020, then later rescheduled for June 2022, the next available commercial mission to deep space. A sample of the couple's cremated remains will be sealed into a specially made capsule designed to withstand space travel. A spacecraft will carry the capsule, along with digitized tributes from fans, on Celestis' \"Enterprise Flight\". The flight will also contain the ashes of Nichelle Nichols and Douglas Trumbull.\n\n","h_score":1932848.4812500002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":13148,"revid":1172136154,"description":"American screenwriter and producer (1921\u20131991)","categories":["1921 births","1991 deaths","20th-century American businesspeople","20th-century American male writers","20th-century American novelists","20th-century American screenwriters","20th-century pseudonymous writers","American humanists","American male novelists","American male screenwriters","American male television writers","American science fiction writers","American television writers","Commercial aviators","Critics of religions","Film producers from California","Film producers from New Jersey","Film producers from Texas","Former Baptists","Gene Roddenberry","Hugo Award-winning writers","Los Angeles City College alumni","Los Angeles Police Department officers","Mass media people from El Paso, Texas","Military personnel from Texas","Novelists from New Jersey","People from River Edge, New Jersey","Recipients of the Air Medal","Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)","Science Fiction Hall of Fame inductees","Screenwriters from California","Screenwriters from Los Angeles","Screenwriters from New Jersey","Screenwriters from Texas","Showrunners","Space burials","Television producers from California","Television producers from New Jersey","Television producers from Texas","United States Army Air Forces bomber pilots of World War II","United States Army Air Forces officers","Writers Guild of America Award winners"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: Grade 7\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

When the Sci-Fi Channel was launched, the first broadcast was a dedication to two \"science fiction pioneers\": Isaac Asimov and Roddenberry. The Roddenberry crater on Mars is named after him, as is the asteroid 4659 Roddenberry. Roddenberry and Star Trek have been cited as inspiration for other science fiction franchises, with George Lucas crediting the series for enabling Star Wars to be produced. J. Michael Straczynski, creator of the Babylon 5 franchise, appreciated Star Trek amongst other science fiction series and \"what they had to say about who we are, and where we are going.\"\n\nDavid Alexander collaborated with Roddenberry on a biography over two decades. Titled Star Trek Creator, it was published in 1995. Yvonne Fern's book Gene Roddenberry: The Last Conversation detailed a series of conversations she had with Roddenberry over the last months of his life. In October 2002, a plaque was placed at Roddenberry's birthplace in El Paso, Texas. The El Paso Independent School District named the 40-foot, 120-seat Roddenberry Planetarium in his honor. The planetarium was recently upgraded and relocated to northeast El Paso. The Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted Roddenberry in 2007, and the Television Academy Hall of Fame in January 2010.\n\nCommemorating Roddenberry's 100th birthday in August 2021, NASA used its Deep Space Network to transmit a 1976 recording of Roddenberry towards the direction of the star system 40 Eridani (the host of the fictional planet Vulcan). The signal will reach the star in early 2038.\n\n","h_score":1932848.4812500002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":13148,"revid":1172136154,"description":"American screenwriter and producer (1921\u20131991)","categories":["1921 births","1991 deaths","20th-century American businesspeople","20th-century American male writers","20th-century American novelists","20th-century American screenwriters","20th-century pseudonymous writers","American humanists","American male novelists","American male screenwriters","American male television writers","American science fiction writers","American television writers","Commercial aviators","Critics of religions","Film producers from California","Film producers from New Jersey","Film producers from Texas","Former Baptists","Gene Roddenberry","Hugo Award-winning writers","Los Angeles City College alumni","Los Angeles Police Department officers","Mass media people from El Paso, Texas","Military personnel from Texas","Novelists from New Jersey","People from River Edge, New Jersey","Recipients of the Air Medal","Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)","Science Fiction Hall of Fame inductees","Screenwriters from California","Screenwriters from Los Angeles","Screenwriters from New Jersey","Screenwriters from Texas","Showrunners","Space burials","Television producers from California","Television producers from New Jersey","Television producers from Texas","United States Army Air Forces bomber pilots of World War II","United States Army Air Forces officers","Writers Guild of America Award winners"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 8\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

During 1974, Roddenberry reworked the Genesis II concept as a second pilot, Planet Earth, for rival network ABC, with similar less-than-successful results. The pilot was aired on April 23, 1974. While Roddenberry wanted to create something that could feasibly exist in the future, the network wanted stereotypical science-fiction women and were unhappy when that was not delivered. Roddenberry was not involved in a third reworking of the material by ABC that produced Strange New World. He began developing MAGNA I, an underwater science-fiction series, for 20th Century Fox Television. By the time the work on the script was complete, though, those who had approved the project had left Fox and their replacements were not interested in the project. A similar fate was faced by Tribunes, a science-fiction police series, which Roddenberry attempted to get off the ground between 1973 and 1977. He gave up after four years; the series never even reached the pilot stage. In 1974, Roddenberry was paid \\$25,000 by John Whitmore to write a script called The Nine. Intended to be about Andrija Puharich's parapsychological research, it evolved into a frank exploration of his experiences attempting to earn a living attending science fiction conventions. At the time, he was again close to losing his house because of a lack of income. The pilot Spectre, Roddenberry's 1977 attempt to create an occult detective duo similar to Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, was released as a television movie within the United States and received a limited theatrical release in the United Kingdom.","h_score":1932848.4812500002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":13148,"revid":1172136154,"description":"American screenwriter and producer (1921\u20131991)","categories":["1921 births","1991 deaths","20th-century American businesspeople","20th-century American male writers","20th-century American novelists","20th-century American screenwriters","20th-century pseudonymous writers","American humanists","American male novelists","American male screenwriters","American male television writers","American science fiction writers","American television writers","Commercial aviators","Critics of religions","Film producers from California","Film producers from New Jersey","Film producers from Texas","Former Baptists","Gene Roddenberry","Hugo Award-winning writers","Los Angeles City College alumni","Los Angeles Police Department officers","Mass media people from El Paso, Texas","Military personnel from Texas","Novelists from New Jersey","People from River Edge, New Jersey","Recipients of the Air Medal","Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)","Science Fiction Hall of Fame inductees","Screenwriters from California","Screenwriters from Los Angeles","Screenwriters from New Jersey","Screenwriters from Texas","Showrunners","Space burials","Television producers from California","Television producers from New Jersey","Television producers from Texas","United States Army Air Forces bomber pilots of World War II","United States Army Air Forces officers","Writers Guild of America Award winners"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 8\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

Nectoux comments that Marie was \"without beauty, wit or a fortune ... narrow and cold\", but records that \"in spite of everything [Faur\u00e9] still felt a tenderness towards her\". The marriage was affectionate, but Marie was, in Nectoux's phrase, \"a stay-at-home\", and she did not share her husband's wish to go out in the evenings, and became resentful of his frequent absences, his dislike of domestic life \u2013 \"horreur du domicile\" \u2013 and his love affairs, while she remained at home. Though Faur\u00e9 valued Marie as a friend and confidante, writing to her often \u2013 sometimes daily \u2013 when away from home, she did not share his passionate nature, which found fulfilment elsewhere. Faur\u00e9 and his wife had two sons. The first, born in 1883, Emmanuel Faur\u00e9-Fremiet (Marie insisted on combining her family name with Faur\u00e9's), became a biologist of international reputation. The second son, Philippe, born in 1889, became a writer; his works included histories, plays, and biographies of his father and grandfather.

According to the biographer Jean-Michel Nectoux, the Faur\u00e9 family dates to the 13th century in that part of France. The family had at one time been substantial landowners, but by the 19th century its means had become reduced. The composer's paternal grandfather, Gabriel, was a butcher whose son became a schoolmaster. In 1829 Faur\u00e9's parents married. His mother was the daughter of a minor member of the nobility. He was the only one of the six children to display musical talent; his four brothers pursued careers in journalism, politics, the army and the civil service, and his sister had a traditional life as the wife of a public servant. The young Faur\u00e9 was sent to live with a foster mother until he was four years old. When his father was appointed director of the \u00c9cole Normale d'Instituteurs, a teacher training college, at Montgauzy, near Foix, in 1849, Faur\u00e9 returned to live with his family. There was a chapel attached to the school, which Faur\u00e9 recalled in the last year of his life: > I grew up, a rather quiet well-behaved child, in an area of great beauty. ... But the only thing I remember really clearly is the harmonium in that little chapel. Every time I could get away I ran there \u2013 and I regaled myself. ... I played atrociously ... no method at all, quite without technique, but I do remember that I was happy; and if that is what it means to have a vocation, then it is a very pleasant thing. An old blind woman, who came to listen and give the boy advice, told his father of Faur\u00e9's gift for music. In 1853 Simon-Lucien Dufaur de Saubiac, of the National Assembly, heard Faur\u00e9 play and advised Toussaint-Honor\u00e9 to send him to the \u00c9cole de Musique Classique et Religieuse (School of Classical and Religious Music), better known as the \u00c9cole Niedermeyer de Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer was setting up in Paris. After reflecting for a year, Faur\u00e9's father agreed and took the nine-year-old boy to Paris in October 1854. Helped by a scholarship from the bishop of his home diocese, Faur\u00e9 boarded at the school for 11 years. The r\u00e9gime was austere, the rooms gloomy, the food mediocre, and the required uniform elaborate. The musical tuition, however, was excellent. Niedermeyer, whose goal was to produce qualified organists and choirmasters, focused on church music. Faur\u00e9's tutors were Cl\u00e9ment Loret for organ, Louis Dietsch for harmony, Xavier Wackenthaler for counterpoint and fugue, and Niedermeyer for piano, plainsong and composition. When Niedermeyer died in March 1861, Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns took charge of piano studies and introduced contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. Faur\u00e9 recalled in old age, \"After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known. ...

Faur\u00e9 won many prizes while at the school, including a premier prix in composition for the Cantique de Jean Racine, Op. 11, the earliest of his choral works to enter the regular repertory.

These sets were composed across the decades of his career, and display the change in his style from uncomplicated youthful charm to a final enigmatic, but sometimes fiery introspection, by way of a turbulent period in his middle years. His other notable piano pieces, including shorter works, or collections composed or published as a set, are Romances sans paroles, Ballade in F major, Mazurka in B major, Th\u00e8me et variations in C minor, and Huit pi\u00e8ces br\u00e8ves. For piano duet, Faur\u00e9 composed the Dolly Suite and, together with his friend and former pupil Andr\u00e9 Messager, an exuberant parody of Wagner in the short suite Souvenirs de Bayreuth.\n\nThe piano works often use arpeggiated figures, with the melody interspersed between the two hands, and include finger substitutions natural for organists. These aspects make them daunting for some pianists. Even a virtuoso like Liszt said that he found Faur\u00e9's music hard to play. The early piano works are clearly influenced by Chopin. An even greater influence was Schumann, whose piano music Faur\u00e9 loved more than any other. In Copland's view, it was with the sixth Nocturne that Faur\u00e9 fully emerged from any predecessor's shadow. The pianist Alfred Cortot said, \"There are few pages in all music comparable to these.\" The critic Bryce Morrison has noted that pianists frequently prefer to play the charming earlier piano works, such as the Impromptu No. 2, rather than the later piano works, which express \"such private passion and isolation, such alternating anger and resignation\" that listeners are left uneasy. In his piano music, as in most of his works, Faur\u00e9 shunned virtuosity in favour of the classical lucidity often associated with the French. He was unimpressed by purely virtuoso pianists, saying, \"the greater they are, the worse they play me.\"\n\n","h_score":1895452.8500000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":73087,"revid":1172169295,"description":"French composer, musician and teacher (1845\u20131924)","categories":["1845 births","1924 deaths","19th-century French composers","19th-century French male musicians","19th-century French musicians","19th-century classical composers","20th-century French musicians","20th-century classical composers","Academic staff of the Conservatoire de Paris","Burials at Passy Cemetery","Classical composers of church music","Deaf classical musicians","Deaths from pneumonia in France","Directors of the Conservatoire de Paris","French classical organists","French deaf people","French male classical composers","French military personnel of the Franco-Prussian War","French opera composers","Gabriel Faur\u00e9","Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour","Infectious disease deaths in France","Male classical organists","Male opera composers","Occitan musicians","People from Pamiers","Pupils of Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Gabriel Faur\u00e9: Master of French Melody\n\nGabriel Faur\u00e9 was a prominent French composer whose works defined late Romantic music with their subtle beauty and innovation.

Copland found premonitions of late Faur\u00e9 in even the earliest works, and traces of the early Faur\u00e9 in the works of his old age: \"The themes, harmonies, form, have remained essentially the same, but with each new work they have all become more fresh, more personal, more profound.\" When Faur\u00e9 was born, Berlioz and Chopin were still composing; the latter was among Faur\u00e9's early influences. In his later years Faur\u00e9 developed compositional techniques that foreshadowed the atonal music of Schoenberg, and, later still, drew discreetly on the techniques of jazz. Duchen writes that early works such as the Cantique de Jean Racine are in the tradition of French nineteenth-century romanticism, yet his late works are as modern as any of the works of his pupils.\n\nInfluences on Faur\u00e9, particularly in his early work, included not only Chopin but Mozart and Schumann. The authors of The Record Guide (1955), Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, wrote that Faur\u00e9 learnt restraint and beauty of surface from Mozart, tonal freedom and long melodic lines from Chopin, \"and from Schumann, the sudden felicities in which his development sections abound, and those codas in which whole movements are briefly but magically illuminated.\" His work was based on the strong understanding of harmonic structures that he gained at the \u00c9cole Niedermeyer from Niedermeyer's successor Gustave Lef\u00e8vre. Lef\u00e8vre wrote the book Trait\u00e9 d'harmonie (Paris, 1889), in which he sets out a harmonic theory that differs significantly from the classical theory of Rameau, no longer outlawing certain chords as \"dissonant\". By using unresolved mild discords and colouristic effects, Faur\u00e9 anticipated the techniques of Impressionist composers.\n\nIn contrast with his harmonic and melodic style, which pushed the bounds for his time, Faur\u00e9's rhythmic motives tended to be subtle and repetitive, with little to break the flow of the line, although he used discreet syncopations, similar to those found in Brahms's works. Copland referred to him as \"the Brahms of France\". The music critic Jerry Dubins suggests that Faur\u00e9 \"represents the link between the late German Romanticism of Brahms ... and the French Impressionism of Debussy.\"\n\nTo Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, Faur\u00e9's later works do not display the easy charm of his earlier music: \"the luscious romantic harmony which had always been firmly supported by a single tonality, later gave way to a severely monochrome style, full of enharmonic shifts, and creating the impression of several tonal centres simultaneously employed.\"\n\n","h_score":1895452.8500000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":73087,"revid":1172169295,"description":"French composer, musician and teacher (1845\u20131924)","categories":["1845 births","1924 deaths","19th-century French composers","19th-century French male musicians","19th-century French musicians","19th-century classical composers","20th-century French musicians","20th-century classical composers","Academic staff of the Conservatoire de Paris","Burials at Passy Cemetery","Classical composers of church music","Deaf classical musicians","Deaths from pneumonia in France","Directors of the Conservatoire de Paris","French classical organists","French deaf people","French male classical composers","French military personnel of the Franco-Prussian War","French opera composers","Gabriel Faur\u00e9","Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour","Infectious disease deaths in France","Male classical organists","Male opera composers","Occitan musicians","People from Pamiers","Pupils of Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Gabriel Faur\u00e9: Master of Subtle Melodies\n\nGabriel Faur\u00e9, the French composer, revolutionized late Romantic music with his elegant, introspective style.

In that year he received the Grand-Croix of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, an honour rare for a musician. In 1922 the president of the republic, Alexandre Millerand, led a public tribute to Faur\u00e9, a national hommage, described in The Musical Times as \"a splendid celebration at the Sorbonne, in which the most illustrious French artists participated, [which] brought him great joy. It was a poignant spectacle, indeed: that of a man present at a concert of his own works and able to hear not a single note. He sat gazing before him pensively, and, in spite of everything, grateful and content.\" Faur\u00e9 suffered from poor health in his later years, brought on in part by heavy smoking. Despite this, he remained available to young composers, including members of Les Six, most of whom were devoted to him. Nectoux writes, \"In old age he attained a kind of serenity, without losing any of his remarkable spiritual vitality, but rather removed from the sensualism and the passion of the works he wrote between 1875 and 1895.\" In his last months, Faur\u00e9 struggled to complete his String Quartet. Twenty years earlier he had been the dedicatee of Ravel's String Quartet. Ravel and others urged Faur\u00e9 to compose one of his own. He refused for many years, on the grounds that it was too difficult. When he finally decided to write it, he did so in trepidation, telling his wife, \"I've started a Quartet for strings, without piano. This is a genre which Beethoven in particular made famous, and causes all those who are not Beethoven to be terrified of it.\" He worked on the piece for a year, finishing it on 11 September 1924, less than two months before he died, working long hours towards the end to complete it. The quartet was premiered after his death; he declined an offer to have it performed privately for him in his last days, as his hearing had deteriorated to the point where musical sounds were horribly distorted in his ear. Faur\u00e9 died in Paris from pneumonia on 4 November 1924 at the age of 79. He was given a state funeral at the \u00c9glise de la Madeleine and is buried in the Passy Cemetery in Paris. After Faur\u00e9's death, the Conservatoire abandoned his radicalism and became resistant to new trends in music, with Faur\u00e9's own harmonic practice being held up as the farthest limit of modernity, beyond which students should not go. His successor, Henri Rabaud, director of the Conservatoire from 1922 to 1941, declared \"modernism is the enemy\". The generation of students born between the wars rejected this outdated premise, turning for inspiration to Bart\u00f3k, the Second Viennese School, and the latest works of Stravinsky. In a centenary tribute in 1945, the musicologist Leslie Orrey wrote in The Musical Times, \"'More profound than Saint-Sa\u00ebns, more varied than Lalo, more spontaneous than d'Indy, more classic than Debussy, Gabriel Faur\u00e9 is the master par excellence of French music, the perfect mirror of our musical genius.'

Faur\u00e9's pupil Ravel had been eliminated prematurely in his sixth attempt for this award, and many believed that reactionary elements within the Conservatoire had played a part in it. Dubois, who became the subject of much censure, brought forward his retirement and stepped down at once. Appointed in his place, and with the support of the French government, Faur\u00e9 radically changed the administration and curriculum. He appointed independent external judges to decide on admissions, examinations and competitions, a move which enraged faculty members who had given preferential treatment to their private pupils; feeling themselves deprived of a considerable extra income, many of them resigned. Faur\u00e9 was dubbed \"Robespierre\" by disaffected members of the old guard as he modernised and broadened the range of music taught at the Conservatoire. As Nectoux puts it, \"where Auber, Hal\u00e9vy and especially Meyerbeer had reigned supreme ... it was now possible to sing an aria by Rameau or even some Wagner \u2013 up to now a forbidden name within the Conservatoire's walls\". The curriculum was broadened to range from Renaissance polyphony to the works of Debussy. Faur\u00e9's new position left him better off financially. However, while he also became much more widely known as a composer, running the Conservatoire left him with no more time for composition than when he was struggling to earn a living as an organist and piano teacher. As soon as the working year was over, in the last days of July, he would leave Paris and spend the two months until early October in a hotel, usually by one of the Swiss lakes, to concentrate on composition. His works from this period include his lyric opera, P\u00e9n\u00e9lope (1913), and some of his most characteristic later songs (e.g., the cycle La chanson d'\u00c8ve, Op. 95, completed in 1910) and piano pieces (Nocturnes Nos. 9\u201311; Barcarolles Nos. 7\u201311, written between 1906 and 1914). Faur\u00e9 was elected to the Institut de France in 1909, after his father-in-law and Saint-Sa\u00ebns, both long-established members, had canvassed strongly on his behalf. He won the ballot by a narrow margin, with 18 votes against 16 for the other candidate, Widor. In the same year a group of young composers led by Ravel and Koechlin broke with the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Musique, which under the presidency of Vincent d'Indy had become a reactionary organisation, and formed a new group, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 musicale ind\u00e9pendante. While Faur\u00e9 accepted the presidency of this society, he also remained a member of the older one and continued on the best of terms with d'Indy; his sole concern was the fostering of new music. In 1911 he oversaw the Conservatoire's move to new premises in the rue de Madrid.","h_score":1895452.8500000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":73087,"revid":1172169295,"description":"French composer, musician and teacher (1845\u20131924)","categories":["1845 births","1924 deaths","19th-century French composers","19th-century French male musicians","19th-century French musicians","19th-century classical composers","20th-century French musicians","20th-century classical composers","Academic staff of the Conservatoire de Paris","Burials at Passy Cemetery","Classical composers of church music","Deaf classical musicians","Deaths from pneumonia in France","Directors of the Conservatoire de Paris","French classical organists","French deaf people","French male classical composers","French military personnel of the Franco-Prussian War","French opera composers","Gabriel Faur\u00e9","Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour","Infectious disease deaths in France","Male classical organists","Male opera composers","Occitan musicians","People from Pamiers","Pupils of Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade 9-12\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

He was one of the foremost French composers of his generation, and his musical style influenced many 20th-century composers. Among his best-known works are his Pavane, Requiem, Sicilienne, nocturnes for piano and the songs \"Apr\u00e8s un r\u00eave\" and \"Clair de lune\". Although his best-known and most accessible compositions are generally his earlier ones, Faur\u00e9 composed many of his most highly regarded works in his later years, in a more harmonically and melodically complex style.\n\nFaur\u00e9 was born into a cultured but not especially musical family. His talent became clear when he was a young boy. At the age of nine, he was sent to the \u00c9cole Niedermeyer music college in Paris, where he was trained to be a church organist and choirmaster. Among his teachers was Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns, who became a lifelong friend. After graduating from the college in 1865, Faur\u00e9 earned a modest living as an organist and teacher, leaving him little time for composition. When he became successful in his middle age, holding the important posts of organist of the \u00c9glise de la Madeleine and director of the Paris Conservatoire, he still lacked time for composing; he retreated to the countryside in the summer holidays to concentrate on composition. By his last years, he was recognised in France as the leading French composer of his day. An unprecedented national musical tribute was held for him in Paris in 1922, headed by the president of the French Republic. Outside France, Faur\u00e9's music took decades to become widely accepted, except in Britain, where he had many admirers during his lifetime.\n\nFaur\u00e9's music has been described as linking the end of Romanticism with the modernism of the second quarter of the 20th century. When he was born, Chopin was still composing, and by the time of Faur\u00e9's death, jazz and the atonal music of the Second Viennese School were being heard.

He was one of the foremost French composers of his generation, and his musical style influenced many 20th-century composers. Among his best-known works are his Pavane, Requiem, Sicilienne, nocturnes for piano and the songs \"Apr\u00e8s un r\u00eave\" and \"Clair de lune\". Although his best-known and most accessible compositions are generally his earlier ones, Faur\u00e9 composed many of his most highly regarded works in his later years, in a more harmonically and melodically complex style.\n\nFaur\u00e9 was born into a cultured but not especially musical family. His talent became clear when he was a young boy. At the age of nine, he was sent to the \u00c9cole Niedermeyer music college in Paris, where he was trained to be a church organist and choirmaster. Among his teachers was Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns, who became a lifelong friend. After graduating from the college in 1865, Faur\u00e9 earned a modest living as an organist and teacher, leaving him little time for composition. When he became successful in his middle age, holding the important posts of organist of the \u00c9glise de la Madeleine and director of the Paris Conservatoire, he still lacked time for composing; he retreated to the countryside in the summer holidays to concentrate on composition. By his last years, he was recognised in France as the leading French composer of his day. An unprecedented national musical tribute was held for him in Paris in 1922, headed by the president of the French Republic. Outside France, Faur\u00e9's music took decades to become widely accepted, except in Britain, where he had many admirers during his lifetime.\n\nFaur\u00e9's music has been described as linking the end of Romanticism with the modernism of the second quarter of the 20th century. When he was born, Chopin was still composing, and by the time of Faur\u00e9's death, jazz and the atonal music of the Second Viennese School were being heard. The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, which describes him as the most advanced composer of his generation in France, notes that his harmonic and melodic innovations influenced the teaching of harmony for later generations. During the last twenty years of his life, he suffered from increasing deafness.

An adaptation of the Persian fable One Thousand and One Nights, the French-Italian production recounts the tale from the perspective of Scheherazade (Zeta-Jones), one of the brides of King Sharir (Thierry Lhermitte). 1001 Nights did not perform well at the box office, and according to de Broca's obituary in The Daily Telegraph, the film \"is best remembered for its enjoyable nude scenes.\" Greater success followed when she starred opposite David Jason and Pam Ferris in the ITV period comedy-drama television series The Darling Buds of May from 1991 to 1993. Adapted from H. E. Bates' novel of the same name, Zeta-Jones played the role of the eldest daughter of a family living in the countryside in 1950s Britain. The series was the highest-rated television show in the country at the time, and Zeta-Jones gained wide public recognition for it. \"Literally, with one hour of television my life completely changed. I couldn't go anywhere\", she remarked. Following a brief appearance as Beatriz Enr\u00edquez de Arana in the unsuccessful adventure film Christopher Columbus: The Discovery (1992), Zeta-Jones featured as a belly dancer in disguise in a 1992 episode of George Lucas' television series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles. She next took on the part of an aspiring duchess in Splitting Heirs (1993), a farcical period drama from the director Robert Young about two children (Eric Idle and Rick Moranis) who are separated at birth. Reviews of the film were negative, though the critic Vincent Canby of The New York Times found her to be \"very funny\". In 1994, Zeta-Jones played the melancholic Eustacia Vye in the television film The Return of the Native, an adaptation of the 1878 novel of the same name by Thomas Hardy, and the wife of Lloyd Owen's character in the television war drama The Cinder Path. She was then cast as the eponymous protagonist of the 1995 television biopic Catherine the Great. In a mixed review, critic Lisa Nesselson of Variety found the miniseries to be \"brightly colored\" but \"wooden and hollow\", though thought that Zeta-Jones \"imparts a certain grace and resolve to her sovereign-in-the-making\". She next appeared as the pragmatic girlfriend of Sean Pertwee's character in Blue Juice (1995), publicised as Britain's first surf film, which the critic Leonard Maltin dismissed as a \"superficial and predictable\" production. Dismayed at being typecast as the token pretty girl in British films, Zeta-Jones relocated to Los Angeles, stating: \"There was all this fuss about who I was and wasn't dating. I was a pretty face and a big bust and nothing else. People in the business believed what they read about me. So I decided to move away and start again.\" She believed that her anonymity in America helped her obtain roles on merit and not due to her public image. She earned the part of Sala, the henchwoman to the villainous Drax (Treat Williams) in the superhero film The Phantom (1996), starring Billy Zane in the titular role. A reviewer for Variety considered Zeta-Jones to be a standout in her part, but the film received a negative critical reception and earned little at the box office. The CBS television miniseries Titanic (1996), however, was better received. Starring opposite Peter Gallagher and George C. Scott, she played the lead role of Isabella Paradine, a young mother who engages in an extramarital affair aboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic.","h_score":1965916.7750000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":150996,"revid":1171446775,"description":"Welsh actress (born 1969)","categories":["1969 births","20th-century Welsh actresses","21st-century Welsh actresses","Actresses from Swansea","Audiobook narrators","Best Supporting Actress Academy Award winners","Best Supporting Actress BAFTA Award winners","Commanders of the Order of the British Empire","Douglas family","Drama Desk Award winners","European Film Awards winners (people)","Living people","National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children people","Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture Screen Actors Guild Award winners","Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role Screen Actors Guild Award winners","People educated at Dumbarton House School","People educated at the Arts Educational Schools","People with bipolar disorder","Tony Award winners","Welsh dancers","Welsh expatriates in the United States","Welsh female dancers","Welsh film actresses","Welsh musical theatre actresses","Welsh people of Irish descent","Welsh television actresses","Welsh voice actresses"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Catherine Zeta-Jones?  \nA1: She is a Welsh actress known for her Hollywood roles.  \n\nQ2: Where was she born?  \nA2: She was born in Swansea, Wales, on September 25, 1969.  \n\nQ3: What is her early career background?  \nA3: She started in British theater and TV before moving to films.  \n\nQ4: What are some of her major films?  \nA4: Key films include The Mask of Zorro and Chicago.  \n\nQ5: Has she won any awards?  \nA5: Yes, she won an Academy Award for Chicago in 2003.  \n\nQ6: What about her personal life?  \nA6: She married actor Michael Douglas in 2000; they have two children.  \n\nQ7: Is she involved in other activities?  \nA7: She engages in philanthropy, including mental health advocacy.  \n\nQ8: How has her career evolved recently?  \nA8: She continues acting in TV and films, focusing on diverse roles."}

Dominic Patten of Deadline Hollywood found Zeta-Jones to be \"wonderfully cast\" and Sonia Saraiya of Variety credited her for providing \"the best turn in the show\". Displeased with an \"unauthorized use of her name and identity\" in the series, de Havilland, at 101 years old, sued the network and producers of Feud for invasion of privacy and other personality rights. The lawsuit was later dismissed by a California appellate court.\n\nIn 2018, Zeta-Jones starred as the drug lord Griselda Blanco in the Lifetime television film Cocaine Godmother. Despite her character's misdeeds, she was drawn to her character's fortitude and ability to stand out in a male-dominated business. Writing for IndieWire, Hanh Nguyen criticised the decision to cast Zeta-Jones in the part of a Latino woman, adding that \"she's not just unconvincing; she's outlandish\". She next played the lead role of Vicki Ellis, an unrelenting pageant coach, in the Facebook Watch comedy-drama series Queen America. To play a character who has bulimia, she drew on her teenage experiences of interacting with dancers who had eating disorders. In a positive review, Jen Chaney of Vulture wrote that \"Zeta-Jones is always at her best when she's fiery, and this part gives her plenty of opportunities to shift into beast mode\".\n\nIn 2021, Zeta-Jones appeared in a recurring role in the second season of the Fox drama series Prodigal Son. She played Dr. Vivian Capshaw, a doctor, opposite Michael Sheen. The series was cancelled after its second season. She next took on a guest role as Morticia Addams in two episodes of the Netflix fantasy series Wednesday (2022). Dave Nemetz of TVLine found her \"exquisitely well-cast\" in her small part. Wednesday emerged as the second most-watched English-language Netflix series within three weeks of release. She subsequently played the main antagonist of the Disney+ adventure series National Treasure: Edge of History. Joshua Alston of Variety found Zeta-Jones to be the \"best thing\" about the show, adding that \"her snarling villainy veers so close to camp that it sounds at times like she\u2019s workshopping a comedic impression of her own voice\".\n\n","h_score":1965916.7750000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":150996,"revid":1171446775,"description":"Welsh actress (born 1969)","categories":["1969 births","20th-century Welsh actresses","21st-century Welsh actresses","Actresses from Swansea","Audiobook narrators","Best Supporting Actress Academy Award winners","Best Supporting Actress BAFTA Award winners","Commanders of the Order of the British Empire","Douglas family","Drama Desk Award winners","European Film Awards winners (people)","Living people","National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children people","Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture Screen Actors Guild Award winners","Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role Screen Actors Guild Award winners","People educated at Dumbarton House School","People educated at the Arts Educational Schools","People with bipolar disorder","Tony Award winners","Welsh dancers","Welsh expatriates in the United States","Welsh female dancers","Welsh film actresses","Welsh musical theatre actresses","Welsh people of Irish descent","Welsh television actresses","Welsh voice actresses"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Catherine Zeta-Jones?  \nA1: She's a Welsh actress who dazzled Hollywood with her charisma and talent.\n\nQ2: Where was she born?  \nA2: In Swansea, Wales, where her journey to stardom began amidst rolling hills.\n\nQ3: What are some of her famous films?  \nA3: She shone in \"The Mask of Zorro\" and \"Chicago,\" blending action and musical flair.\n\nQ4: Has she won any awards?  \nA4: Yes, she earned an Academy Award for \"Chicago,\" cementing her as a versatile star.\n\nQ5: Who is she married to?  \nA5: Michael Douglas, her partner in life and Hollywood, sharing a glamorous family story.\n\nQ6: What other interests does she pursue?  \nA6: Beyond acting, she enjoys dancing and philanthropy, adding depth to her vibrant persona.\n\nQ7: How has she influenced modern cinema?  \nA7: As a leading lady, she broke molds for women in action roles, inspiring new generations.\n\nQ8: What's her recent work?  \nA8: Recently, she's appeared in TV series like \"Prodigal Son,\" keeping her career elegantly alive."}

She continued to feature on the list from 2000 to 2004. In 2003, Esquire labelled her \"the most beautiful woman on the planet\". In 2011, she was named the most beautiful British woman by a poll conducted by the television network QVC. She was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by the Monarchy of the United Kingdom in 2010 for her film and charity work. In 2019, she was honoured with the Freedom of the City of Swansea.\n\nThe journalist Sheila Johnston of The Daily Telegraph, in 2010, described Zeta-Jones as \"the ultimate self-made success\" who \"constantly made bold decisions, and scrubbed up very nicely into a luscious star who radiates a classic [...] brand of big-screen glamour.\" Guy Adams of The Independent considers her personality to be \"self-effacing and energetic\" but takes note of her \"steely core\" in her off-screen persona. Zeta-Jones's success in her early Hollywood films The Mask of Zorro (1998) and Entrapment (1999) relied predominantly on her sex appeal, but she was later appreciated for her versatility.\n\nZeta-Jones's career graph and marriage to Douglas have been a subject of satire. A 2006 episode of the satirical British television show Star Stories (2006\u20132008) was entitled Catherine Zeta-Jones\u2014Her Quest to Prove Herself ... And Also Find Love, about a fictitious life story of Zeta-Jones. Addressing her perceived media image, she remarked in a 2004 interview with USA Weekend: \"The biggest misconception of me is that I'm some die-hard, ambitious, do-anything-to-get-anything kind of person, I'm not. I'm very shy socially.\" Zeta-Jones is protective of her public image, and the use of her likeness is carefully controlled. As well as taking legal action against Hello! magazine, she sued a Nevada-based topless club for including her image on their advertising. In 2003, the celebrity biographer Cliff Goodwin wrote an unauthorised biography of the actress, entitled Catherine Zeta Jones: The Biography, but the publication was indefinitely postponed after her lawyers issued threats of legal action against both Goodwin and his publisher.\n\n","h_score":1965916.7750000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":150996,"revid":1171446775,"description":"Welsh actress (born 1969)","categories":["1969 births","20th-century Welsh actresses","21st-century Welsh actresses","Actresses from Swansea","Audiobook narrators","Best Supporting Actress Academy Award winners","Best Supporting Actress BAFTA Award winners","Commanders of the Order of the British Empire","Douglas family","Drama Desk Award winners","European Film Awards winners (people)","Living people","National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children people","Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture Screen Actors Guild Award winners","Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role Screen Actors Guild Award winners","People educated at Dumbarton House School","People educated at the Arts Educational Schools","People with bipolar disorder","Tony Award winners","Welsh dancers","Welsh expatriates in the United States","Welsh female dancers","Welsh film actresses","Welsh musical theatre actresses","Welsh people of Irish descent","Welsh television actresses","Welsh voice actresses"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Catherine Zeta-Jones?  \nA1: She's a Welsh-born Hollywood star, dazzling audiences with her emerald eyes and sultry charm since the 90s.  \n\nQ2: What sparked her acting career?  \nA2: Starting in British TV, her breakout role in \"The Mask of Zorro\" swung her into global fame, blending swordplay with seductive flair.  \n\nQ3: What are her iconic films?  \nA3: Think \"Chicago\" for Oscar-winning jazz heels or \"Entrapment\" for tech-thrilling heists; she masters glamour and grit alike.  \n\nQ4: How did she meet Michael Douglas?  \nA4: At a film event, their age-gap romance ignited like a Hollywood script, leading to marriage and a family under spotlights.  \n\nQ5: What awards has she won?  \nA5: An Academy Award for \"Chicago\" crowns her, plus Golden Globes, proving her talent shines brighter than red-carpet diamonds.  \n\nQ6: How has she balanced family and work?  \nA6: Juggling acting with motherhood, she takes breaks for personal glow-ups, returning with fierce, reinvigorated roles.  \n\nQ7: What's her style signature?  \nA7: Bold red lips and elegant gowns define her, a mix of classic Hollywood allure with modern edge, always camera-ready.  \n\nQ8: What's her lasting impact?  \nA8: As a versatile icon, she inspires with resilience, from battling health issues to mentoring new talents in Tinseltown's shadows."}

Known for her versatility, she is the recipient of various accolades, including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, and a Tony Award. In 2010, she was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for her film and humanitarian work.\n\nBorn and raised in Swansea, Zeta-Jones aspired to be an actress from a young age. As a child, she played roles in the West End productions of the musicals Annie and Bugsy Malone. She studied musical theatre at the Arts Educational Schools, London, and made her stage breakthrough with a leading role in a 1987 production of 42nd Street. Her screen debut came in the unsuccessful French-Italian film 1001 Nights (1990), and she went on to find greater success as a regular in the British television series The Darling Buds of May (1991\u20131993). Dismayed at being typecast as the token pretty girl in British films, Zeta-Jones relocated to Los Angeles. She established herself in Hollywood with roles that highlighted her sex appeal, such as in the action film The Mask of Zorro (1998) and the heist film Entrapment (1999).\n\nZeta-Jones received critical acclaim for her performances as a vengeful pregnant woman in Traffic (2000) and a murderous singer in the musical Chicago (2002), winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for the latter. She starred in high-profile films for much of the decade, including the black comedy Intolerable Cruelty (2003), the heist film Ocean's Twelve (2004), the comedy The Terminal (2004), and the romantic comedy No Reservations (2007). Parts in smaller-scale features were followed by a decrease in workload, during which she returned to the stage and played an ageing actress in a Broadway production of A Little Night Music (2009), winning a Tony Award. Zeta-Jones worked intermittently in the subsequent decades, starring in the films Side Effects (2013), Red 2 (2013) and Dad's Army (2016).

She starred as a shrewd film star, opposite Julia Roberts who featured as her character's under-confident sibling. The critic Roger Ebert compared the film unfavourably to the musical Singin' in the Rain (1952), but thought that Zeta-Jones was aptly \"chilly and manipulative\" in her part. The following year, she starred as the murderous nightclub singer Velma Kelly in Chicago (2002), a film adaptation of the stage musical of the same name from director Rob Marshall. She based her character's look and mannerisms on the actress Louise Brooks, and as the script did not provide a backstory to Kelly, she worked to convey the character's \"flamboyance\" and \"desperation\" through \"little looks and nuances\". The film and her performance received critical acclaim. William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer believed that Zeta-Jones had made \"a wonderfully statuesque and bitchy saloon goddess\", and David Edelstein of Slate wrote that she has \"a smoldering confidence that takes your mind off her not-always-fluid dancingalthough she's a perfectly fine hoofer, with majestic limbs and a commanding cleavage\" and particularly praised her rendition of the song \"All That Jazz\". Chicago grossed \\$306 million worldwide, and was the recipient of the Academy Award for Best Picture. For her performance, she won the Academy Award, SAG Award, and the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress, among other awards and nominations. Following the success of Chicago, Zeta-Jones voiced the part of Princess Marina in Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas (2003), an animated film featuring Brad Pitt as the voice of Sinbad the Sailor. She was drawn to the project to give her young children an opportunity to \"hear [her] and get a sense of [her] on film\", but the film proved to be a box office bomb. Also in 2003, Zeta-Jones starred alongside George Clooney in the Coen brothers' black comedy Intolerable Cruelty. A commercial success, the film saw her play the role of a serial divorc\u00e9e who is drawn towards a divorce lawyer (Clooney). Writing for Empire, the critic Damon Wise labelled the film a \"dazzling screwball comedy\" and felt that Zeta-Jones had shown \"an admirable facility for old-school quickfire patter\". Other reviewers praised her onscreen chemistry with Clooney. In 2004, Spielberg approached her to play an insecure air hostess in his comedy The Terminal, a film about a man (Tom Hanks) who is trapped at the JFK International Airport when he is denied entry into the United States. Spielberg was intent on her playing against type as a strong-willed woman, with a vulnerability in her character, but the critic A. O. Scott felt that it came across as using her for \"her looks rather than for the arch, self-mocking wit that is her secret weapon as a comic actress\". Commercially, The Terminal performed well. She next worked with Soderbergh to film Ocean's Twelve, a sequel to his heist film Ocean's Eleven (2001), which also reunited her with stars Clooney, Pitt, and Roberts. The production, which was filmed in several European countries, saw Zeta-Jones play Isabel Lahiri, a Europol agent, and the love interest of Pitt's character. Paul Clinton of CNN noted that her sex appeal benefited the film. Conversely, Ken Tucker of New York magazine argued that her character was redundant to the film's plot. Despite dividing critics, the sequel grossed over \\$360 million globally.","h_score":1965916.7750000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":150996,"revid":1171446775,"description":"Welsh actress (born 1969)","categories":["1969 births","20th-century Welsh actresses","21st-century Welsh actresses","Actresses from Swansea","Audiobook narrators","Best Supporting Actress Academy Award winners","Best Supporting Actress BAFTA Award winners","Commanders of the Order of the British Empire","Douglas family","Drama Desk Award winners","European Film Awards winners (people)","Living people","National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children people","Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture Screen Actors Guild Award winners","Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role Screen Actors Guild Award winners","People educated at Dumbarton House School","People educated at the Arts Educational Schools","People with bipolar disorder","Tony Award winners","Welsh dancers","Welsh expatriates in the United States","Welsh female dancers","Welsh film actresses","Welsh musical theatre actresses","Welsh people of Irish descent","Welsh television actresses","Welsh voice actresses"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Catherine Zeta-Jones: A Star's Timeless Allure\n\nWelsh-born actress Catherine Zeta-Jones has captivated audiences for decades with her blend of elegance and charisma, earning accolades in films like \"Chicago\" and \"The Mask of Zorro.\" Her recent ventures include stage work and family life, highlighting her enduring versatility.\n\n**Early Beginnings**  \nZeta-Jones grew up in Wales, quickly rising to fame with early roles that showcased her talent.\n\n**Hollywood Heights**  \nShe won an Oscar for \"Chicago,\" as critic Roger Ebert noted, \"Zeta-Jones dances with fiery precision, stealing every scene.\"\n\n**Personal and Professional Balance**  \nMarried to Michael Douglas, she balances acting with advocacy, with Douglas once saying, \"Her strength inspires me daily.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Zeta-Jones is poised to explore new creative projects that blend her iconic style with fresh challenges."}

Set ten years after the first film, the sequel follows El\u00e9na struggling with married life. Unlike the original, the film was disliked by critics and was a commercial disappointment. She did not have any film releases in 2006. A biopic of Harry Houdini, titled Death Defying Acts (2007), starring Guy Pearce as the escapologist Houdini, featured Zeta-Jones as a Scottish con artist who claims psychic powers. The unsuccessful production was given only a limited theatrical release. In 2007, Zeta-Jones starred alongside Aaron Eckhart and Abigail Breslin in the romantic comedy No Reservations, a remake of the German film Mostly Martha (2001). No Reservations tells the story of an ambitious chef (Zeta-Jones) whose life changes for the better when she takes in her young niece (Breslin) after her sister's death. In preparation for her part, Zeta-Jones worked in the kitchen and waited on tables at New York's Fiamma Osteria restaurant. Claudia Puig of USA Today wrote that Zeta-Jones \"shines as a character that finely balances off-putting reserve with sympathetic appeal\", and Roger Ebert, despite disliking the film, did find her to be \"convincing\" in her role. With a global gross of \\$92 million, the film marked her final commercial success of the decade. After No Reservations, Zeta-Jones significantly decreased her workload in the following five years. She instead chose to focus on her family and health, having been diagnosed with bipolar II disorder, and her infrequent acting appearances were in smaller-scale and less successful productions. She took on the role of a forty-year-old mother attracted to a younger man (Justin Bartha) in the romantic comedy The Rebound. The production was released theatrically in markets outside of the United States in 2009\u201310, but due to financial troubles of its distributor, The Film Development, the film failed to release theatrically in America. Zeta-Jones returned to the stage in 2009 with a revival of the Stephen Sondheim musical A Little Night Music, which marked her Broadway debut. Set in Sweden during the early twentieth century, the musical follows the complicated relations between a group of people (including characters played by Zeta-Jones, Angela Lansbury and Alexander Hanson) during the course of a summer. She played Desir\u00e9e Armfeldt, an ageing actress, and was particularly drawn to the complexities of the piece, explaining: \"There's no jazzy hands, no high kicks, no fishnet stockings, ... It's not one of those shows where you can dig about three inches and come out the other end. You can keep digging and digging and digging\". She did not listen to past recordings of the songs in the musical so she could bring her own interpretation to them. The critic Claire Prentice of The Daily Telegraph wrote that Zeta-Jones brought in a \"quiet, reflective poignancy\" in her rendition of the song \"Send In the Clowns\", but Emma Brockes of The Guardian was more critical, remarking that \"with her pretty voice, head wresting this way and that, [she] seems to be auditioning for stage school\". For her performance, Zeta-Jones won the Tony Award and Drama Desk Award for Best Actress in a Musical.","h_score":1965916.7750000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":150996,"revid":1171446775,"description":"Welsh actress (born 1969)","categories":["1969 births","20th-century Welsh actresses","21st-century Welsh actresses","Actresses from Swansea","Audiobook narrators","Best Supporting Actress Academy Award winners","Best Supporting Actress BAFTA Award winners","Commanders of the Order of the British Empire","Douglas family","Drama Desk Award winners","European Film Awards winners (people)","Living people","National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children people","Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture Screen Actors Guild Award winners","Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role Screen Actors Guild Award winners","People educated at Dumbarton House School","People educated at the Arts Educational Schools","People with bipolar disorder","Tony Award winners","Welsh dancers","Welsh expatriates in the United States","Welsh female dancers","Welsh film actresses","Welsh musical theatre actresses","Welsh people of Irish descent","Welsh television actresses","Welsh voice actresses"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Catherine Zeta-Jones: The Welsh Siren's Timeless Allure\n\nThe actress has mesmerized audiences with Oscar-winning roles in \"Chicago\" and \"The Mask of Zorro.\" Her life blends Hollywood glamour with family ties to Michael Douglas.\n\n**Early Welsh Roots**  \nBorn in Swansea in 1969, Zeta-Jones started in theater, showcasing her fiery talent early. \"She was destined for greatness,\" said her drama teacher.\n\n**Hollywood Heights**  \nFrom blockbusters to Broadway, she claimed an Academy Award for her vivacious performances.

Reviews of the film were negative, and Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times found Zeta-Jones to be \"far too shrill to amuse\". In the ensemble musical comedy Rock of Ages, co-starring Tom Cruise and Bryan Cranston, Zeta-Jones played the part of a religiously conservative wife of a mayor. She was attracted to the idea of playing a \"nightmare of a woman\" and based the role on the politician Michele Bachmann; the film received mixed reviews and failed commercially. Her final release of 2012 was Playing for Keeps, a romantic comedy with Gerard Butler, which proved to be her third box office failure of the year. In 2013, Zeta-Jones took on a leading role in the crime thriller Broken City, co-starring Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crowe. The film tells the story of a private detective (Wahlberg) who is hired by the mayor of New York City (Crowe) to spy on his wife (Zeta-Jones). The critic Todd McCarthy thought that Zeta-Jones \"looks like class itself and nicely underplays\", and Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail observed that the actress \"does a fair, if incongruous, impersonation of a forties vamp\". However, as with her previous few projects, the film was not widely seen, and received poor reviews. This changed when Zeta-Jones collaborated with Soderbergh for the third time to film the critically acclaimed thriller Side Effects (2013). Co-starring Channing Tatum, Jude Law and Rooney Mara, the film saw her play a mysterious psychiatrist who recommends an antidepressant drug with serious side effects. Peter Travers, writing for Rolling Stone, called the film a \"hell of a thriller, twisty, terrific and packed with surprises\" and found Zeta-Jones to be \"dynamite\" in it. In the action comedy Red 2 (2013), which served as a sequel to the 2010 film Red, Zeta-Jones played a seductive Russian double agent, alongside Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, and Mary-Louise Parker. She was drawn to the project, which follows the comic adventures of retired spies, for \"the action, the humour, [and] the tongue-in-cheek quality of it\". Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, Justin Lowe stated that Zeta-Jones \"nicely pulls off Russian spy Katja's mix of allure and menace\", and with a worldwide gross of \\$148 million, Red 2 emerged as her most widely seen film since No Reservations. Following Red 2, Zeta-Jones took another sabbatical from acting, saying: \"If I'm going to leave my family for any length of time it had better be for a role that I haven't played before, [otherwise] I would prefer to stay at home\". She found such a part opposite Bill Nighy and Toby Jones in the British war comedy film Dad's Army (2016), based on the television sitcom of the same name. She was cast as a glamorous journalist reporting on a British Home Guard platoon based in Walmington-on-Sea. Catherine Bray of Variety considered the film to be an \"amiable but creaky resurrection\" of the sitcom, and added that while Zeta-Jones \"hits the required single note with some spirit\" she was \"generally underused\" in it.","h_score":1965916.7750000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":150996,"revid":1171446775,"description":"Welsh actress (born 1969)","categories":["1969 births","20th-century Welsh actresses","21st-century Welsh actresses","Actresses from Swansea","Audiobook narrators","Best Supporting Actress Academy Award winners","Best Supporting Actress BAFTA Award winners","Commanders of the Order of the British Empire","Douglas family","Drama Desk Award winners","European Film Awards winners (people)","Living people","National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children people","Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture Screen Actors Guild Award winners","Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role Screen Actors Guild Award winners","People educated at Dumbarton House School","People educated at the Arts Educational Schools","People with bipolar disorder","Tony Award winners","Welsh dancers","Welsh expatriates in the United States","Welsh female dancers","Welsh film actresses","Welsh musical theatre actresses","Welsh people of Irish descent","Welsh television actresses","Welsh voice actresses"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 8\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

An adaptation of the Persian fable One Thousand and One Nights, the French-Italian production recounts the tale from the perspective of Scheherazade (Zeta-Jones), one of the brides of King Sharir (Thierry Lhermitte). 1001 Nights did not perform well at the box office, and according to de Broca's obituary in The Daily Telegraph, the film \"is best remembered for its enjoyable nude scenes.\" Greater success followed when she starred opposite David Jason and Pam Ferris in the ITV period comedy-drama television series The Darling Buds of May from 1991 to 1993. Adapted from H. E. Bates' novel of the same name, Zeta-Jones played the role of the eldest daughter of a family living in the countryside in 1950s Britain. The series was the highest-rated television show in the country at the time, and Zeta-Jones gained wide public recognition for it. \"Literally, with one hour of television my life completely changed. I couldn't go anywhere\", she remarked. Following a brief appearance as Beatriz Enr\u00edquez de Arana in the unsuccessful adventure film Christopher Columbus: The Discovery (1992), Zeta-Jones featured as a belly dancer in disguise in a 1992 episode of George Lucas' television series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles. She next took on the part of an aspiring duchess in Splitting Heirs (1993), a farcical period drama from the director Robert Young about two children (Eric Idle and Rick Moranis) who are separated at birth. Reviews of the film were negative, though the critic Vincent Canby of The New York Times found her to be \"very funny\". In 1994, Zeta-Jones played the melancholic Eustacia Vye in the television film The Return of the Native, an adaptation of the 1878 novel of the same name by Thomas Hardy, and the wife of Lloyd Owen's character in the television war drama The Cinder Path. She was then cast as the eponymous protagonist of the 1995 television biopic Catherine the Great. In a mixed review, critic Lisa Nesselson of Variety found the miniseries to be \"brightly colored\" but \"wooden and hollow\", though thought that Zeta-Jones \"imparts a certain grace and resolve to her sovereign-in-the-making\". She next appeared as the pragmatic girlfriend of Sean Pertwee's character in Blue Juice (1995), publicised as Britain's first surf film, which the critic Leonard Maltin dismissed as a \"superficial and predictable\" production. Dismayed at being typecast as the token pretty girl in British films, Zeta-Jones relocated to Los Angeles, stating: \"There was all this fuss about who I was and wasn't dating. I was a pretty face and a big bust and nothing else. People in the business believed what they read about me. So I decided to move away and start again.\" She believed that her anonymity in America helped her obtain roles on merit and not due to her public image. She earned the part of Sala, the henchwoman to the villainous Drax (Treat Williams) in the superhero film The Phantom (1996), starring Billy Zane in the titular role.

The suggestion that Saint-Sa\u00ebns was more proficient than inspired dogged his career and posthumous reputation. He himself wrote, \"Art is intended to create beauty and character. Feeling only comes afterwards and art can very well do without it. In fact, it is very much better off when it does.\" The biographer Jessica Duchen writes that he was \"a troubled man who preferred not to betray the darker side of his soul\". The critic and composer Jeremy Nicholas observes that this reticence has led many to underrate the music; he quotes such slighting remarks as \"Saint-Sa\u00ebns is the only great composer who wasn't a genius\", and \"Bad music well written\". While teaching at the Niedermeyer school Saint-Sa\u00ebns put less of his energy into composing and performing, although an overture entitled Spartacus was crowned at a competition instituted in 1863 by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Sainte C\u00e9cile of Bordeaux. But after he left the school in 1865 he pursued both aspects of his career with vigour. In 1867 his cantata Les noces de Prom\u00e9th\u00e9e beat more than a hundred other entries to win the composition prize of the Grande F\u00eate Internationale in Paris, for which the jury included Auber, Berlioz, Gounod, Rossini and Giuseppe Verdi.

His First, in D (1858), in conventional three-movement form, is not well known, but the Second, in G minor (1868) is one of his most popular works. The composer experimented with form in this piece, replacing the customary sonata form first movement with a more discursive structure, opening with a solemn cadenza. The scherzo second movement and presto finale are in such contrast with the opening that the pianist Zygmunt Stojowski commented that the work \"begins like Bach and ends like Offenbach\". The Third Piano Concerto, in E (1869) has another high-spirited finale, but the earlier movements are more classical, the texture clear, with graceful melodic lines. The Fourth, in C minor (1875) is probably the composer's best-known piano concerto after the Second. It is in two movements, each comprising two identifiable sub-sections, and maintains a thematic unity not found in the composer's other piano concertos. According to some sources it was this piece that so impressed Gounod that he dubbed Saint-Sa\u00ebns \"the Beethoven of France\" (other sources base that distinction on the Third Symphony). The Fifth and last piano concerto, in F major, was written in 1896, more than twenty years after its predecessor. The work is known as the \"Egyptian\" concerto; it was written while the composer was wintering in Luxor, and incorporates a tune he heard Nile boatmen singing. The First Cello Concerto, in A minor (1872) is a serious although animated work, in a single continuous movement with an unusually turbulent first section. It is among the most popular concertos in the cello repertory, much favoured by Pablo Casals and later players. The Second, in D minor (1902), like the Fourth Piano Concerto, consists of two movements each subdivided into two distinct sections. It is more purely virtuosic than its predecessor: Saint-Sa\u00ebns commented to Faur\u00e9 that it would never be as popular as the First because it was too difficult. There are three violin concertos; the first to be composed dates from 1858 but was not published until 1879, as the composer's Second, in C major. The First, in A, was also completed in 1858. It is a short work, its single 314-bar movement lasting less than a quarter of an hour. The Second, in conventional three-movement concerto form, is twice as long as the First, and is the least popular of the three: the thematic catalogue of the composer's works lists only three performances in his lifetime. The Third, in B minor, written for Pablo de Sarasate, is technically challenging for the soloist, although the virtuoso passages are balanced by intervals of pastoral serenity. It is by some margin the most popular of the three violin concertos, but Saint-Sa\u00ebns's best-known concertante work for violin and orchestra is probably the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso, in A minor, Op. 28, a single-movement piece, also written for Sarasate, dating from 1863. It changes from a wistful and tense opening to a swaggering main theme, described as faintly sinister by the critic Gerald Larner, who goes on, \"After a multi-stopped cadenza ... the solo violin makes a breathless sprint through the coda to the happy ending in A major\".","h_score":2110781.0187500003,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":48927,"revid":1172169341,"description":"French composer, organist, conductor and pianist (1835\u20131921)","categories":["1835 births","1921 deaths","19th-century French composers","19th-century French male classical pianists","19th-century French male classical violinists","19th-century classical composers","19th-century organists","20th-century French composers","20th-century French male classical pianists","20th-century French male classical violinists","20th-century classical composers","20th-century organists","Burials at Montparnasse Cemetery","Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns","Child classical musicians","Classical composers of church music","Composers awarded knighthoods","Composers for pedal piano","Composers for piano","Composers for pipe organ","Composers for violin","Conservatoire de Paris alumni","French Romantic composers","French ballet composers","French classical organists","French deists","French male classical composers","French male organists","French military personnel of the Franco-Prussian War","French music critics","French opera composers","French people of Norman descent","Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour","Grand Crosses of the Order of Saint-Charles","Honorary Members of the Royal Philharmonic Society","Male classical organists","Male opera composers","Musicians from Paris","Oratorio composers","Pupils of Fromental Hal\u00e9vy","Recipients of the Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil class)"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns?  \nA1: He was a French composer, pianist, and conductor, born in 1835 and active until 1921.  \n\nQ2: When and where was he born?  \nA2: Born on October 9, 1835, in Paris, France, he showed early musical talent.  \n\nQ3: What are some of his famous works?  \nA3: Highlights include \"The Carnival of the Animals\" and his Symphony No. 3, blending whimsy with grandeur.  \n\nQ4: What instruments did he play?  \nA4: He mastered piano and organ, infusing his compositions with vivid keyboard flair.  \n\nQ5: How did he contribute to music?  \nA5: Saint-Sa\u00ebns promoted French music through teaching and conducting, bridging Romantic and modern styles.  \n\nQ6: What style of music did he compose?  \nA6: He favored Romanticism with classical influences, creating elegant, structured pieces full of melody.  \n\nQ7: Did he have other talents?  \nA7: Beyond music, he wrote poetry and scientific essays, revealing a multifaceted, curious mind.  \n\nQ8: What is his legacy today?  \nA8: His works endure in concerts and films, inspiring with timeless charm and innovation."}

They were privately concerned that their friend was in danger of looking foolish with his excess of patriotism, and his growing tendency to denounce in public the works of rising young composers, as in his condemnation of Debussy's En blanc et noir (1915): \"We must at all costs bar the door of the Institut against a man capable of such atrocities; they should be put next to the cubist pictures.\" His determination to block Debussy's candidacy for election to the Institut was successful, and caused bitter resentment from the younger composer's supporters. Saint-Sa\u00ebns's response to the neoclassicism of Les Six was equally uncompromising: of Darius Milhaud's polytonal symphonic suite Prot\u00e9e (1919) he commented, \"fortunately, there are still lunatic asylums in France\". Saint-Sa\u00ebns gave what he intended to be his farewell concert as a pianist in Paris in 1913, but his retirement was soon in abeyance as a result of the war, during which he gave many performances in France and elsewhere, raising money for war charities. These activities took him across the Atlantic, despite the danger from German submarines. In November 1921, Saint-Sa\u00ebns gave a recital at the Institut for a large invited audience; it was remarked that his playing was as vivid and precise as ever, and that his personal bearing was admirable for a man of eighty-six. He left Paris a month later for Algiers, with the intention of wintering there, as he had long been accustomed to do. While there he died of a heart attack on 16 December 1921. His body was taken back to Paris, and after a state funeral at the Madeleine he was buried at the cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse.

His incomparable talent for orchestration enables him to give relief to ideas which would otherwise be crude and mediocre in themselves ... his works are on the one hand not frivolous enough to become popular in the widest sense, nor on the other do they take hold of the public by that sincerity and warmth of feeling which is so convincing.\n\nAlthough a keen modernist in his youth, Saint-Sa\u00ebns was always deeply aware of the great masters of the past. In a profile of him written to mark his eightieth birthday, the critic D C Parker wrote, \"That Saint-Sa\u00ebns knows Rameau ... Bach and Handel, Haydn and Mozart, must be manifest to all who are familiar with his writings. His love for the classical giants and his sympathy with them form, so to speak, the foundation of his art.\"\n\nLess attracted than some of his French contemporaries to the continuous stream of music popularised by Wagner, Saint-Sa\u00ebns often favoured self-contained melodies. Though they are frequently, in Ratner's phrase, \"supple and pliable\", more often than not they are constructed in three- or four-bar sections, and the \"phrase pattern AABB is characteristic\". An occasional tendency to neoclassicism, influenced by his study of French baroque music, is in contrast with the colourful orchestral music more widely identified with him. Grove observes that he makes his effects more by characterful harmony and rhythms than by extravagant scoring. In both of those areas of his craft he was normally content with the familiar. Rhythmically, he inclined to standard double, triple or compound metres (although Grove points to a 5\/4 passage in the Piano Trio and another in 7\/4 in the Polonaise for two pianos). From his time at the Conservatoire he was a master of counterpoint; contrapuntal passages crop up, seemingly naturally, in many of his works.\n\n","h_score":2110781.0187500003,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":48927,"revid":1172169341,"description":"French composer, organist, conductor and pianist (1835\u20131921)","categories":["1835 births","1921 deaths","19th-century French composers","19th-century French male classical pianists","19th-century French male classical violinists","19th-century classical composers","19th-century organists","20th-century French composers","20th-century French male classical pianists","20th-century French male classical violinists","20th-century classical composers","20th-century organists","Burials at Montparnasse Cemetery","Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns","Child classical musicians","Classical composers of church music","Composers awarded knighthoods","Composers for pedal piano","Composers for piano","Composers for pipe organ","Composers for violin","Conservatoire de Paris alumni","French Romantic composers","French ballet composers","French classical organists","French deists","French male classical composers","French male organists","French military personnel of the Franco-Prussian War","French music critics","French opera composers","French people of Norman descent","Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour","Grand Crosses of the Order of Saint-Charles","Honorary Members of the Royal Philharmonic Society","Male classical organists","Male opera composers","Musicians from Paris","Oratorio composers","Pupils of Fromental Hal\u00e9vy","Recipients of the Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil class)"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns: A Master of French Music\n\nCamille Saint-Sa\u00ebns was a prolific 19th-century French composer, known for his symphonies, operas, and \"The Carnival of the Animals.\" His works blended Romantic and classical styles, influencing modern music education.\n\n#### Early Life\nBorn in 1835 in Paris, Saint-Sa\u00ebns showed prodigious talent as a child pianist and composer.\n\n#### Major Works\nHe composed over 300 works, including the iconic \"Organ Symphony.\" \"Saint-Sa\u00ebns was a master of melody,\" noted music critic Berlioz.\n\n#### Legacy\nHis innovations shaped orchestral music. \"He was the greatest organist in the world,\" said Franz Liszt.\n\nSaint-Sa\u00ebns' compositions continue to inspire contemporary performances."}

In July of that year he and his wife went to the Auvergnat spa town of La Bourboule for a holiday. On 28 July he disappeared from their hotel, and a few days later his wife received a letter from him to say that he would not be returning. They never saw each other again. Marie Saint-Sa\u00ebns returned to her family, and lived until 1950, dying near Bordeaux at the age of ninety-five. Saint-Sa\u00ebns did not divorce his wife and remarry, nor did he form any later intimate relationship with a woman. Rees comments that although there is no firm evidence, some biographers believe that Saint-Sa\u00ebns was more attracted to his own sex than to women. After the death of his children and collapse of his marriage, Saint-Sa\u00ebns increasingly found a surrogate family in Faur\u00e9 and his wife, Marie, and their two sons, to whom he was a much-loved honorary uncle. Marie told him, \"For us you are one of the family, and we mention your name ceaselessly here.\" In the 1880s Saint-Sa\u00ebns continued to seek success in the opera house, an undertaking made the more difficult by an entrenched belief among influential members of the musical establishment that it was unthinkable that a pianist, organist and symphonist could write a good opera. He had two operas staged during the decade, the first being Henry VIII (1883) commissioned by the Paris Op\u00e9ra. Although the libretto was not of his choosing, Saint-Sa\u00ebns, normally a fluent, even facile composer, worked at the score with unusual diligence to capture a convincing air of 16th-century England. The work was a success, and was frequently revived during the composer's lifetime. When it was produced at Covent Garden in 1898, The Era commented that though French librettists generally \"make a pretty hash of British history\", this piece was \"not altogether contemptible as an opera story\". The open-mindedness of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale had hardened by the mid-1880s into a dogmatic adherence to Wagnerian methods favoured by Franck's pupils, led by Vincent d'Indy. They had begun to dominate the organisation and sought to abandon its \"Ars Gallica\" ethos of commitment to French works. Bussine and Saint-Sa\u00ebns found this unacceptable, and resigned in 1886. Having long pressed the merits of Wagner on a sometimes sceptical French public, Saint-Sa\u00ebns was now becoming worried that the German's music was having an excessive impact on young French composers. His increasing caution towards Wagner developed in later years into stronger hostility, directed as much at Wagner's political nationalism as at his music. By the 1880s Saint-Sa\u00ebns was an established favourite with audiences in England, where he was widely regarded as the greatest living French composer. In 1886 the Philharmonic Society of London commissioned what became one of his most popular and respected works, the Third (\"Organ\") Symphony. It was premiered in London at a concert in which Saint-Sa\u00ebns appeared as conductor of the symphony and as soloist in Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto, conducted by Sir Arthur Sullivan. The success of the symphony in London was considerable, but was surpassed by the ecstatic welcome the work received at its Paris premiere early the following year. Later in 1887 Saint-Sa\u00ebns's \"drame lyrique\" Proserpine opened at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique. It was well received and seemed to be heading for a substantial run when the theatre burnt down within weeks of the premiere and the production was lost. In December 1888 Saint-Sa\u00ebns's mother died. He felt her loss deeply, and was plunged into depression and insomnia, even contemplating suicide. He left Paris and stayed in Algiers, where he recuperated until May 1889, walking and reading but unable to compose.","h_score":2110781.0187500003,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":48927,"revid":1172169341,"description":"French composer, organist, conductor and pianist (1835\u20131921)","categories":["1835 births","1921 deaths","19th-century French composers","19th-century French male classical pianists","19th-century French male classical violinists","19th-century classical composers","19th-century organists","20th-century French composers","20th-century French male classical pianists","20th-century French male classical violinists","20th-century classical composers","20th-century organists","Burials at Montparnasse Cemetery","Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns","Child classical musicians","Classical composers of church music","Composers awarded knighthoods","Composers for pedal piano","Composers for piano","Composers for pipe organ","Composers for violin","Conservatoire de Paris alumni","French Romantic composers","French ballet composers","French classical organists","French deists","French male classical composers","French male organists","French military personnel of the Franco-Prussian War","French music critics","French opera composers","French people of Norman descent","Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour","Grand Crosses of the Order of Saint-Charles","Honorary Members of the Royal Philharmonic Society","Male classical organists","Male opera composers","Musicians from Paris","Oratorio composers","Pupils of Fromental Hal\u00e9vy","Recipients of the Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil class)"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns: The Enchanting French Composer\n\nCamille Saint-Sa\u00ebns was a prolific 19th-century French composer whose works blended wit and innovation.

For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music. Saint-Sa\u00ebns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Sa\u00ebns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \"drame lyricque\", Le timbre d'argent (\"The Silver Bell\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel Carr\u00e9's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances. The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Sa\u00ebns a large legacy \"To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition\". Saint-Sa\u00ebns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Sa\u00ebns conducted. In December 1877, Saint-Sa\u00ebns had a more solid operatic success with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation. Although the work eventually became an international success it was not staged at the Paris Op\u00e9ra until 1892. Saint-Sa\u00ebns was a keen traveller. From the 1870s until the end of his life he made 179 trips to 27 countries. His professional engagements took him most often to Germany and England; for holidays, and to avoid Parisian winters which affected his weak chest, he favoured Algiers and various places in Egypt.","h_score":2110781.0187500003,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":48927,"revid":1172169341,"description":"French composer, organist, conductor and pianist (1835\u20131921)","categories":["1835 births","1921 deaths","19th-century French composers","19th-century French male classical pianists","19th-century French male classical violinists","19th-century classical composers","19th-century organists","20th-century French composers","20th-century French male classical pianists","20th-century French male classical violinists","20th-century classical composers","20th-century organists","Burials at Montparnasse Cemetery","Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns","Child classical musicians","Classical composers of church music","Composers awarded knighthoods","Composers for pedal piano","Composers for piano","Composers for pipe organ","Composers for violin","Conservatoire de Paris alumni","French Romantic composers","French ballet composers","French classical organists","French deists","French male classical composers","French male organists","French military personnel of the Franco-Prussian War","French music critics","French opera composers","French people of Norman descent","Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour","Grand Crosses of the Order of Saint-Charles","Honorary Members of the Royal Philharmonic Society","Male classical organists","Male opera composers","Musicians from Paris","Oratorio composers","Pupils of Fromental Hal\u00e9vy","Recipients of the Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil class)"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 7\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

Victor Saint-Sa\u00ebns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Sa\u00ebns died of consumption (tuberculosis) on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris. When Saint-Sa\u00ebns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Sa\u00ebns later wrote, was good training. Cl\u00e9mence Saint-Sa\u00ebns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Sa\u00ebns in 1969, \"It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.\" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Sa\u00ebns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher Alexandre Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Bo\u00ebly. From the latter he acquired a lifelong love of the music of Bach, which was then little known in France. As a schoolboy Saint-Sa\u00ebns was outstanding in many subjects. In addition to his musical prowess, he distinguished himself in the study of French literature, Latin and Greek, divinity, and mathematics. His interests included philosophy, archaeology and astronomy, of which, particularly the last, he remained a talented amateur in later life. In 1848, at the age of thirteen, Saint-Sa\u00ebns was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire, France's foremost music academy.","h_score":2110781.0187500003,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":48927,"revid":1172169341,"description":"French composer, organist, conductor and pianist (1835\u20131921)","categories":["1835 births","1921 deaths","19th-century French composers","19th-century French male classical pianists","19th-century French male classical violinists","19th-century classical composers","19th-century organists","20th-century French composers","20th-century French male classical pianists","20th-century French male classical violinists","20th-century classical composers","20th-century organists","Burials at Montparnasse Cemetery","Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns","Child classical musicians","Classical composers of church music","Composers awarded knighthoods","Composers for pedal piano","Composers for piano","Composers for pipe organ","Composers for violin","Conservatoire de Paris alumni","French Romantic composers","French ballet composers","French classical organists","French deists","French male classical composers","French male organists","French military personnel of the Franco-Prussian War","French music critics","French opera composers","French people of Norman descent","Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour","Grand Crosses of the Order of Saint-Charles","Honorary Members of the Royal Philharmonic Society","Male classical organists","Male opera composers","Musicians from Paris","Oratorio composers","Pupils of Fromental Hal\u00e9vy","Recipients of the Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil class)"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 6\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

He was the only enlisted Marine to receive both of these decorations in World War II.\n\nHe enlisted in the Marine Corps on June 3, 1940, after serving three years in the United States Army with duty in the Philippines. He was deployed to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, and in August 1942, he took part in the invasion of Guadalcanal. In October, he and the two machine-gun sections under his command held off an attack by a numerically far superior Japanese force. He was one of only three Marines in that group to survive. His actions at Guadalcanal earned him the Medal of Honor.\n\nIn February 1945, he was killed in action on the first day of the invasion of Iwo Jima, after he single-handedly destroyed an enemy blockhouse and led a Marine tank under fire safely through a minefield. Including the Medal of Honor, he has received many honors, including having base streets, military facilities, and two United States Navy destroyers named for him.\n\n ## Early life and education\n\nBasilone was born in his Italian American parents' home on November 4, 1916, in Buffalo, New York. He was the sixth of ten children. His five older siblings were born in Raritan, New Jersey, before the family moved to Buffalo where John was born; they returned to Raritan in 1918. His father, Salvatore Basilone, emigrated from , in the province of Benevento, Italy, and settled in Raritan. Basilone's mother, Theadora Bencivenga, was born in 1889 and grew up in Manville, New Jersey, but her parents, Carlo and Catrina, also came from Benevento. Basilone's parents met at a church gathering and married three years later.\n\nBasilone grew up in the nearby Raritan Town (now Borough of Raritan) where he attended St. Bernard Parochial School. After completing middle school at age 15, he dropped out prior to attending high school. Basilone worked as a golf caddy for the local country club before joining the military.\n\n ## Military service\n\n ### U.S. Army\n\nBasilone enlisted in the United States Army in July 1934 and completed his three-year enlistment with service in the Philippines, where he was a champion boxer. In the Army, Basilone was initially assigned to the 16th Infantry at Fort Jay, New York, before being discharged for a day, reenlisting, and being assigned to the 31st Infantry.\n\nAfter he was released from active duty, Basilone returned home and worked as a truck driver in Reisterstown, Maryland. After driving trucks for a few years, he wanted to go back to Manila and believed he could get there faster by serving in the Marine Corps rather than in the Army.\n\n ### U.S. Marine Corps\n\nHe enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1940, in Baltimore, Maryland. He went to recruit training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, followed by training at Marine Corps Base Quantico and New River. The Marines sent him to Guant\u00e1namo Bay for his next assignment and then to Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands as a member of \"D\" Company, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division.\n\n #### Guadalcanal\n\nOn October 24, 1942, during the Battle for Henderson Field, his unit came under attack by a regiment of about 3,000 soldiers from the Japanese Sendai Division using machine guns, grenades, and mortars against the American heavy machine guns. Basilone commanded two sections of machine guns which fought for the next two days until only Basilone and two other Marines were left standing. As the battle went on, ammunition became critically low. Despite their supply lines having been cut off by enemies who had infiltrated into the rear, Basilone fought through hostile ground to resupply his heavy machine gunners with urgently needed supplies. Basilone moved an extra gun into position and maintained continual fire against the incoming Japanese forces. He then repaired and manned another machine gun, holding the defensive line until relief arrived.\n\nWhen the last of the ammunition ran out shortly before dawn on the second day, Basilone, using his pistol and a machete, held off the Japanese soldiers attacking his position. By the end of the engagement, Japanese forces opposite the Marines' lines had been virtually annihilated. For his actions during the battle, Basilone received the United States military's highest award for valor, the Medal of Honor. Afterwards, Private First Class Nash W. Phillips of Fayetteville, North Carolina, recalled from the battle for Guadalcanal:\n\n> \"Basilone had a machine gun on the go for three days and nights without sleep, rest, or food. He was in a good emplacement, and causing the Japanese lots of trouble, not only firing his machine gun, but also using his pistol.\"\n\n #### War bond tours\n\nIn 1943, Basilone returned to the United States and participated in war bond tours. His arrival was highly publicized, and his hometown held a parade in his honor when he returned. The homecoming parade occurred on Sunday, September 19 and drew a huge crowd with thousands of people, including politicians, celebrities, and the national press. The parade made national news in Life magazine and Fox Movietone News. After the parade, Basilone toured the country raising money for the war effort and achieved celebrity status.\n\nAlthough he appreciated the admiration, he felt out of place and requested to return to the operating forces fighting the war. The Marine Corps denied his request and told him he was needed more on the home front. He was offered a commission, which he turned down, and was later offered an assignment as an instructor, but refused this as well. When he requested again to return to the war, the request was approved. He left for Camp Pendleton, California, for training on December 27. On July 3, 1944, he reenlisted in the Marine Corps.\n\n #### Marriage\n\nWhile stationed at Camp Pendleton, Basilone met his future wife, Lena Mae Riggi, who was a sergeant in the Marine Corps Women's Reserve. They were married at St. Mary's Star of the Sea Church in Oceanside, California, on July 10, 1944, with a reception at the Carlsbad Hotel. They honeymooned at an onion farm near Portland, Oregon.\n\n #### Iwo Jima and death\n\nAfter his request to return to the fleet was approved, Basilone was assigned to \"C\" Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Marine Regiment, 5th Marine Division. On February 19, 1945, the first day of the invasion of Iwo Jima, he was serving as a machine gun section leader on Red Beach II. While the Marines landed, the Japanese concentrated their fire at the incoming Marines from heavily fortified blockhouses staged throughout the island. With his unit pinned down, Basilone made his way around the side of the Japanese positions until he was directly on top of the blockhouse. He then attacked with grenades and demolitions, single-handedly destroying the entire strong point and its defending garrison.\n\nHe then fought his way toward Airfield Number 1 and aided a Marine tank that was trapped in an enemy mine field under intense mortar and artillery barrages. He guided the heavy vehicle over the hazardous terrain to safety, despite heavy weapons fire from the Japanese. As he moved along the edge of the airfield, he was killed by Japanese mortar shrapnel (based on his research for the book and miniseries The Pacific, author Hugh Ambrose suggested that Basilone was killed by a burst of small arms fire which hit him in the right groin and neck and nearly took off his left arm).\n\nHis actions helped Marines penetrate the Japanese defense and get off the landing beach during the critical early stages of the invasion. Basilone was posthumously awarded the Marine Corps' second-highest decoration for valor, the Navy Cross, for extraordinary heroism during the battle of Iwo Jima.\n\n #### Burial\n\nHe was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia. His widow, Lena M. Basilone, died on June 11, 1999, aged 86, and is buried at Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California. Lena's obituary notes that she never remarried and was buried still wearing her wedding ring.\n\n ## Awards and decorations\n\nGunnery Sergeant Basilone's military awards include:\n\n ### Medal of Honor citation\n\nBasilone's Medal of Honor citation reads as follows:\n\nThe President of the United States in the name of The Congress takes pride in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to\n\nfor service as set forth in the following CITATION:\n\n> For extraordinary heroism and conspicuous gallantry in action against enemy Japanese forces, above and beyond the call of duty, while serving with the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division in the Lunga Area, Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, on 24 and 25 October 1942. While the enemy was hammering at the Marines' defensive positions, Sgt. BASILONE, in charge of 2 sections of heavy machine guns, fought valiantly to check the savage and determined assault. In a fierce frontal attack with the Japanese blasting his guns with grenades and mortar fire, one of Sgt. BASILONE'S sections, with its gun crews, was put out of action, leaving only 2 men able to carry on. Moving an extra gun into position, he placed it in action, then, under continual fire, repaired another and personally manned it, gallantly holding his line until replacements arrived. A little later, with ammunition critically low and the supply lines cut off, Sgt. BASILONE, at great risk of his life and in the face of continued enemy attack, battled his way through hostile lines with urgently needed shells for his gunners, thereby contributing in large measure to the virtual annihilation of a Japanese regiment. His great personal valor and courageous initiative were in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.\n\n","h_score":1766931.1312500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":2822189,"revid":1170301544,"description":"US Marine Corps sergeant and Medal of Honor recipient (1916\u20131945)","categories":["1916 births","1945 deaths","American male boxers","American people of Italian descent","Battle of Iwo Jima","Burials at Arlington National Cemetery","Military personnel from Buffalo, New York","Military personnel from Maryland","Military personnel from New Jersey","People from Raritan, New Jersey","People from Reistertown, Maryland","Recipients of the Navy Cross (United States)","United States Army soldiers","United States Marine Corps Medal of Honor recipients","United States Marine Corps non-commissioned officers","United States Marine Corps personnel killed in World War II","World War II recipients of the Medal of Honor"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was John Basilone?  \nA1: John Basilone was a United States Marine Gunnery Sergeant during World War II.\n\nQ2: Where was he born and raised?  \nA2: He was born in 1916 in Buffalo, New York, and grew up in New Jersey.\n\nQ3: What was his early military service like?  \nA3: Basilone enlisted in the Army in 1934, then joined the Marines in 1940, serving in the Philippines.\n\nQ4: What role did he play at Guadalcanal?  \nA4: He defended against Japanese attacks, destroying enemy positions and aiding his unit's survival.\n\nQ5: Why did he receive the Medal of Honor?  \nA5: For his bravery at Guadalcanal in 1942, where he held off waves of enemies despite heavy fire.\n\nQ6: Did he return to combat after his award?  \nA6: Yes, he rejoined the Marines and fought at Iwo Jima in 1945.\n\nQ7: How did he die?  \nA7: Basilone was killed in action at Iwo Jima on February 19, 1945, during an assault.\n\nQ8: What is his legacy?  \nA8: He is remembered as a war hero, with monuments and stories honoring his courage in U.S. history."}

He was the only enlisted Marine to receive both of these decorations in World War II.\n\nHe enlisted in the Marine Corps on June 3, 1940, after serving three years in the United States Army with duty in the Philippines. He was deployed to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, and in August 1942, he took part in the invasion of Guadalcanal. In October, he and the two machine-gun sections under his command held off an attack by a numerically far superior Japanese force. He was one of only three Marines in that group to survive. His actions at Guadalcanal earned him the Medal of Honor.\n\nIn February 1945, he was killed in action on the first day of the invasion of Iwo Jima, after he single-handedly destroyed an enemy blockhouse and led a Marine tank under fire safely through a minefield. Including the Medal of Honor, he has received many honors, including having base streets, military facilities, and two United States Navy destroyers named for him.\n\n ## Early life and education\n\nBasilone was born in his Italian American parents' home on November 4, 1916, in Buffalo, New York. He was the sixth of ten children. His five older siblings were born in Raritan, New Jersey, before the family moved to Buffalo where John was born; they returned to Raritan in 1918. His father, Salvatore Basilone, emigrated from , in the province of Benevento, Italy, and settled in Raritan. Basilone's mother, Theadora Bencivenga, was born in 1889 and grew up in Manville, New Jersey, but her parents, Carlo and Catrina, also came from Benevento. Basilone's parents met at a church gathering and married three years later.\n\nBasilone grew up in the nearby Raritan Town (now Borough of Raritan) where he attended St. Bernard Parochial School.

He was the only enlisted Marine to receive both of these decorations in World War II.\n\nHe enlisted in the Marine Corps on June 3, 1940, after serving three years in the United States Army with duty in the Philippines. He was deployed to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, and in August 1942, he took part in the invasion of Guadalcanal. In October, he and the two machine-gun sections under his command held off an attack by a numerically far superior Japanese force. He was one of only three Marines in that group to survive. His actions at Guadalcanal earned him the Medal of Honor.\n\nIn February 1945, he was killed in action on the first day of the invasion of Iwo Jima, after he single-handedly destroyed an enemy blockhouse and led a Marine tank under fire safely through a minefield. Including the Medal of Honor, he has received many honors, including having base streets, military facilities, and two United States Navy destroyers named for him.\n\n ## Early life and education\n\nBasilone was born in his Italian American parents' home on November 4, 1916, in Buffalo, New York. He was the sixth of ten children. His five older siblings were born in Raritan, New Jersey, before the family moved to Buffalo where John was born; they returned to Raritan in 1918. His father, Salvatore Basilone, emigrated from , in the province of Benevento, Italy, and settled in Raritan. Basilone's mother, Theadora Bencivenga, was born in 1889 and grew up in Manville, New Jersey, but her parents, Carlo and Catrina, also came from Benevento. Basilone's parents met at a church gathering and married three years later.\n\nBasilone grew up in the nearby Raritan Town (now Borough of Raritan) where he attended St. Bernard Parochial School. After completing middle school at age 15, he dropped out prior to attending high school. Basilone worked as a golf caddy for the local country club before joining the military.\n\n ## Military service\n\n ### U.S. Army\n\nBasilone enlisted in the United States Army in July 1934 and completed his three-year enlistment with service in the Philippines, where he was a champion boxer. In the Army, Basilone was initially assigned to the 16th Infantry at Fort Jay, New York, before being discharged for a day, reenlisting, and being assigned to the 31st Infantry.\n\nAfter he was released from active duty, Basilone returned home and worked as a truck driver in Reisterstown, Maryland. After driving trucks for a few years, he wanted to go back to Manila and believed he could get there faster by serving in the Marine Corps rather than in the Army.\n\n ### U.S. Marine Corps\n\nHe enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1940, in Baltimore, Maryland. He went to recruit training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, followed by training at Marine Corps Base Quantico and New River. The Marines sent him to Guant\u00e1namo Bay for his next assignment and then to Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands as a member of \"D\" Company, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division.\n\n #### Guadalcanal\n\nOn October 24, 1942, during the Battle for Henderson Field, his unit came under attack by a regiment of about 3,000 soldiers from the Japanese Sendai Division using machine guns, grenades, and mortars against the American heavy machine guns. Basilone commanded two sections of machine guns which fought for the next two days until only Basilone and two other Marines were left standing. As the battle went on, ammunition became critically low. Despite their supply lines having been cut off by enemies who had infiltrated into the rear, Basilone fought through hostile ground to resupply his heavy machine gunners with urgently needed supplies. Basilone moved an extra gun into position and maintained continual fire against the incoming Japanese forces. He then repaired and manned another machine gun, holding the defensive line until relief arrived.\n\nWhen the last of the ammunition ran out shortly before dawn on the second day, Basilone, using his pistol and a machete, held off the Japanese soldiers attacking his position. By the end of the engagement, Japanese forces opposite the Marines' lines had been virtually annihilated. For his actions during the battle, Basilone received the United States military's highest award for valor, the Medal of Honor. Afterwards, Private First Class Nash W. Phillips of Fayetteville, North Carolina, recalled from the battle for Guadalcanal:\n\n> \"Basilone had a machine gun on the go for three days and nights without sleep, rest, or food. He was in a good emplacement, and causing the Japanese lots of trouble, not only firing his machine gun, but also using his pistol.\"\n\n #### War bond tours\n\nIn 1943, Basilone returned to the United States and participated in war bond tours. His arrival was highly publicized, and his hometown held a parade in his honor when he returned. The homecoming parade occurred on Sunday, September 19 and drew a huge crowd with thousands of people, including politicians, celebrities, and the national press. The parade made national news in Life magazine and Fox Movietone News. After the parade, Basilone toured the country raising money for the war effort and achieved celebrity status.\n\nAlthough he appreciated the admiration, he felt out of place and requested to return to the operating forces fighting the war. The Marine Corps denied his request and told him he was needed more on the home front. He was offered a commission, which he turned down, and was later offered an assignment as an instructor, but refused this as well. When he requested again to return to the war, the request was approved. He left for Camp Pendleton, California, for training on December 27. On July 3, 1944, he reenlisted in the Marine Corps.\n\n #### Marriage\n\nWhile stationed at Camp Pendleton, Basilone met his future wife, Lena Mae Riggi, who was a sergeant in the Marine Corps Women's Reserve. They were married at St. Mary's Star of the Sea Church in Oceanside, California, on July 10, 1944, with a reception at the Carlsbad Hotel. They honeymooned at an onion farm near Portland, Oregon.\n\n #### Iwo Jima and death\n\nAfter his request to return to the fleet was approved, Basilone was assigned to \"C\" Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Marine Regiment, 5th Marine Division. On February 19, 1945, the first day of the invasion of Iwo Jima, he was serving as a machine gun section leader on Red Beach II. While the Marines landed, the Japanese concentrated their fire at the incoming Marines from heavily fortified blockhouses staged throughout the island. With his unit pinned down, Basilone made his way around the side of the Japanese positions until he was directly on top of the blockhouse. He then attacked with grenades and demolitions, single-handedly destroying the entire strong point and its defending garrison.\n\nHe then fought his way toward Airfield Number 1 and aided a Marine tank that was trapped in an enemy mine field under intense mortar and artillery barrages. He guided the heavy vehicle over the hazardous terrain to safety, despite heavy weapons fire from the Japanese. As he moved along the edge of the airfield, he was killed by Japanese mortar shrapnel (based on his research for the book and miniseries The Pacific, author Hugh Ambrose suggested that Basilone was killed by a burst of small arms fire which hit him in the right groin and neck and nearly took off his left arm).\n\nHis actions helped Marines penetrate the Japanese defense and get off the landing beach during the critical early stages of the invasion. Basilone was posthumously awarded the Marine Corps' second-highest decoration for valor, the Navy Cross, for extraordinary heroism during the battle of Iwo Jima.\n\n #### Burial\n\nHe was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia. His widow, Lena M. Basilone, died on June 11, 1999, aged 86, and is buried at Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California. Lena's obituary notes that she never remarried and was buried still wearing her wedding ring.\n\n ## Awards and decorations\n\nGunnery Sergeant Basilone's military awards include:\n\n ### Medal of Honor citation\n\nBasilone's Medal of Honor citation reads as follows:\n\nThe President of the United States in the name of The Congress takes pride in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to\n\nfor service as set forth in the following CITATION:\n\n> For extraordinary heroism and conspicuous gallantry in action against enemy Japanese forces, above and beyond the call of duty, while serving with the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division in the Lunga Area, Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, on 24 and 25 October 1942.

Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation shortly after landing when his company's advance was held up by the concentrated fire of a heavily fortified Japanese blockhouse, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE boldly defied the smashing bombardment of heavy caliber fire to work his way around the flank and up to a position directly on top of the blockhouse and then, attacking with grenades and demolitions, single handedly destroyed the entire hostile strong point and its defending garrison. Consistently daring and aggressive as he fought his way over the battle-torn beach and up the sloping, gun-studded terraces toward Airfield Number 1, he repeatedly exposed himself to the blasting fury of exploding shells and later in the day coolly proceeded to the aid of a friendly tank which had been trapped in an enemy mine field under intense mortar and artillery barrages, skillfully guiding the heavy vehicle over the hazardous terrain to safety, despite the overwhelming volume of hostile fire. In the forefront of the assault at all times, he pushed forward with dauntless courage and iron determination until, moving upon the edge of the airfield, he fell, instantly killed by a bursting mortar shell. Stouthearted and indomitable, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE, by his intrepid initiative, outstanding skill, and valiant spirit of self-sacrifice in the face of the fanatic opposition, contributed materially to the advance of his company during the early critical period of the assault, and his unwavering devotion to duty throughout the bitter conflict was an inspiration to his comrades and reflects the highest credit upon Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.\n\n ## Other honors\n\nBasilone received numerous honors, including the following:\n\n ### Marine Corps\n\n- An entry point onto Camp Pendleton from US Interstate 5 is called \"Basilone Road\"\n- US Interstate 5 from the San Diego County line to Camp Pendleton to the south is called \"Gunnery Sergeant John Basilone Memorial Highway\"\n- A parachute landing zone at Camp Pendleton is called \"Basilone Drop Zone\"\n- During the Crucible portion of Marine Corps Recruit Training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, there is an obstacle named \"Basilone's Challenge\" that consists of carrying ammunition cans filled with concrete up a steep, wooded hill\n\n ### Navy\n\n- The United States Navy commissioned USS Basilone, a Gearing-class destroyer, in 1949. The ship's keel was laid down on July 7, 1945, in Orange, Texas, and launched on December 21, 1945. His widow, Sergeant Lena Mae Basilone, sponsored the ship.\n- A plaque at the United States Navy Memorial in Washington, D.C.\n- The John Basilone (DDG-122) was laid down in January 2020.\n\n","h_score":1766931.1312500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":2822189,"revid":1170301544,"description":"US Marine Corps sergeant and Medal of Honor recipient (1916\u20131945)","categories":["1916 births","1945 deaths","American male boxers","American people of Italian descent","Battle of Iwo Jima","Burials at Arlington National Cemetery","Military personnel from Buffalo, New York","Military personnel from Maryland","Military personnel from New Jersey","People from Raritan, New Jersey","People from Reistertown, Maryland","Recipients of the Navy Cross (United States)","United States Army soldiers","United States Marine Corps Medal of Honor recipients","United States Marine Corps non-commissioned officers","United States Marine Corps personnel killed in World War II","World War II recipients of the Medal of Honor"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Hero of the Pacific: John Basilone's Legendary Bravery\n\nJohn Basilone, a Medal of Honor recipient, exemplified courage during World War II's Guadalcanal battle, where he single-handedly destroyed enemy positions.

He was the only enlisted Marine to receive both of these decorations in World War II.\n\nHe enlisted in the Marine Corps on June 3, 1940, after serving three years in the United States Army with duty in the Philippines. He was deployed to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, and in August 1942, he took part in the invasion of Guadalcanal. In October, he and the two machine-gun sections under his command held off an attack by a numerically far superior Japanese force. He was one of only three Marines in that group to survive. His actions at Guadalcanal earned him the Medal of Honor.\n\nIn February 1945, he was killed in action on the first day of the invasion of Iwo Jima, after he single-handedly destroyed an enemy blockhouse and led a Marine tank under fire safely through a minefield. Including the Medal of Honor, he has received many honors, including having base streets, military facilities, and two United States Navy destroyers named for him.\n\n ## Early life and education\n\nBasilone was born in his Italian American parents' home on November 4, 1916, in Buffalo, New York. He was the sixth of ten children. His five older siblings were born in Raritan, New Jersey, before the family moved to Buffalo where John was born; they returned to Raritan in 1918. His father, Salvatore Basilone, emigrated from , in the province of Benevento, Italy, and settled in Raritan. Basilone's mother, Theadora Bencivenga, was born in 1889 and grew up in Manville, New Jersey, but her parents, Carlo and Catrina, also came from Benevento. Basilone's parents met at a church gathering and married three years later.\n\nBasilone grew up in the nearby Raritan Town (now Borough of Raritan) where he attended St. Bernard Parochial School. After completing middle school at age 15, he dropped out prior to attending high school. Basilone worked as a golf caddy for the local country club before joining the military.\n\n ## Military service\n\n ### U.S. Army\n\nBasilone enlisted in the United States Army in July 1934 and completed his three-year enlistment with service in the Philippines, where he was a champion boxer. In the Army, Basilone was initially assigned to the 16th Infantry at Fort Jay, New York, before being discharged for a day, reenlisting, and being assigned to the 31st Infantry.\n\nAfter he was released from active duty, Basilone returned home and worked as a truck driver in Reisterstown, Maryland. After driving trucks for a few years, he wanted to go back to Manila and believed he could get there faster by serving in the Marine Corps rather than in the Army.\n\n ### U.S. Marine Corps\n\nHe enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1940, in Baltimore, Maryland. He went to recruit training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, followed by training at Marine Corps Base Quantico and New River. The Marines sent him to Guant\u00e1namo Bay for his next assignment and then to Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands as a member of \"D\" Company, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division.\n\n #### Guadalcanal\n\nOn October 24, 1942, during the Battle for Henderson Field, his unit came under attack by a regiment of about 3,000 soldiers from the Japanese Sendai Division using machine guns, grenades, and mortars against the American heavy machine guns. Basilone commanded two sections of machine guns which fought for the next two days until only Basilone and two other Marines were left standing. As the battle went on, ammunition became critically low. Despite their supply lines having been cut off by enemies who had infiltrated into the rear, Basilone fought through hostile ground to resupply his heavy machine gunners with urgently needed supplies. Basilone moved an extra gun into position and maintained continual fire against the incoming Japanese forces. He then repaired and manned another machine gun, holding the defensive line until relief arrived.\n\nWhen the last of the ammunition ran out shortly before dawn on the second day, Basilone, using his pistol and a machete, held off the Japanese soldiers attacking his position. By the end of the engagement, Japanese forces opposite the Marines' lines had been virtually annihilated. For his actions during the battle, Basilone received the United States military's highest award for valor, the Medal of Honor. Afterwards, Private First Class Nash W. Phillips of Fayetteville, North Carolina, recalled from the battle for Guadalcanal:\n\n> \"Basilone had a machine gun on the go for three days and nights without sleep, rest, or food. He was in a good emplacement, and causing the Japanese lots of trouble, not only firing his machine gun, but also using his pistol.\"\n\n #### War bond tours\n\nIn 1943, Basilone returned to the United States and participated in war bond tours. His arrival was highly publicized, and his hometown held a parade in his honor when he returned. The homecoming parade occurred on Sunday, September 19 and drew a huge crowd with thousands of people, including politicians, celebrities, and the national press. The parade made national news in Life magazine and Fox Movietone News. After the parade, Basilone toured the country raising money for the war effort and achieved celebrity status.\n\nAlthough he appreciated the admiration, he felt out of place and requested to return to the operating forces fighting the war. The Marine Corps denied his request and told him he was needed more on the home front. He was offered a commission, which he turned down, and was later offered an assignment as an instructor, but refused this as well. When he requested again to return to the war, the request was approved. He left for Camp Pendleton, California, for training on December 27. On July 3, 1944, he reenlisted in the Marine Corps.\n\n #### Marriage\n\nWhile stationed at Camp Pendleton, Basilone met his future wife, Lena Mae Riggi, who was a sergeant in the Marine Corps Women's Reserve. They were married at St. Mary's Star of the Sea Church in Oceanside, California, on July 10, 1944, with a reception at the Carlsbad Hotel. They honeymooned at an onion farm near Portland, Oregon.\n\n #### Iwo Jima and death\n\nAfter his request to return to the fleet was approved, Basilone was assigned to \"C\" Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Marine Regiment, 5th Marine Division. On February 19, 1945, the first day of the invasion of Iwo Jima, he was serving as a machine gun section leader on Red Beach II. While the Marines landed, the Japanese concentrated their fire at the incoming Marines from heavily fortified blockhouses staged throughout the island. With his unit pinned down, Basilone made his way around the side of the Japanese positions until he was directly on top of the blockhouse. He then attacked with grenades and demolitions, single-handedly destroying the entire strong point and its defending garrison.\n\nHe then fought his way toward Airfield Number 1 and aided a Marine tank that was trapped in an enemy mine field under intense mortar and artillery barrages. He guided the heavy vehicle over the hazardous terrain to safety, despite heavy weapons fire from the Japanese. As he moved along the edge of the airfield, he was killed by Japanese mortar shrapnel (based on his research for the book and miniseries The Pacific, author Hugh Ambrose suggested that Basilone was killed by a burst of small arms fire which hit him in the right groin and neck and nearly took off his left arm).\n\nHis actions helped Marines penetrate the Japanese defense and get off the landing beach during the critical early stages of the invasion. Basilone was posthumously awarded the Marine Corps' second-highest decoration for valor, the Navy Cross, for extraordinary heroism during the battle of Iwo Jima.\n\n #### Burial\n\nHe was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia. His widow, Lena M. Basilone, died on June 11, 1999, aged 86, and is buried at Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California. Lena's obituary notes that she never remarried and was buried still wearing her wedding ring.\n\n ## Awards and decorations\n\nGunnery Sergeant Basilone's military awards include:\n\n ### Medal of Honor citation\n\nBasilone's Medal of Honor citation reads as follows:\n\nThe President of the United States in the name of The Congress takes pride in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to\n\nfor service as set forth in the following CITATION:\n\n> For extraordinary heroism and conspicuous gallantry in action against enemy Japanese forces, above and beyond the call of duty, while serving with the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division in the Lunga Area, Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, on 24 and 25 October 1942. While the enemy was hammering at the Marines' defensive positions, Sgt. BASILONE, in charge of 2 sections of heavy machine guns, fought valiantly to check the savage and determined assault. In a fierce frontal attack with the Japanese blasting his guns with grenades and mortar fire, one of Sgt. BASILONE'S sections, with its gun crews, was put out of action, leaving only 2 men able to carry on. Moving an extra gun into position, he placed it in action, then, under continual fire, repaired another and personally manned it, gallantly holding his line until replacements arrived. A little later, with ammunition critically low and the supply lines cut off, Sgt. BASILONE, at great risk of his life and in the face of continued enemy attack, battled his way through hostile lines with urgently needed shells for his gunners, thereby contributing in large measure to the virtual annihilation of a Japanese regiment. His great personal valor and courageous initiative were in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.\n\n","h_score":1766931.1312500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":2822189,"revid":1170301544,"description":"US Marine Corps sergeant and Medal of Honor recipient (1916\u20131945)","categories":["1916 births","1945 deaths","American male boxers","American people of Italian descent","Battle of Iwo Jima","Burials at Arlington National Cemetery","Military personnel from Buffalo, New York","Military personnel from Maryland","Military personnel from New Jersey","People from Raritan, New Jersey","People from Reistertown, Maryland","Recipients of the Navy Cross (United States)","United States Army soldiers","United States Marine Corps Medal of Honor recipients","United States Marine Corps non-commissioned officers","United States Marine Corps personnel killed in World War II","World War II recipients of the Medal of Honor"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 8\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

In the Army, Basilone was initially assigned to the 16th Infantry at Fort Jay, New York, before being discharged for a day, reenlisting, and being assigned to the 31st Infantry.\n\nAfter he was released from active duty, Basilone returned home and worked as a truck driver in Reisterstown, Maryland. After driving trucks for a few years, he wanted to go back to Manila and believed he could get there faster by serving in the Marine Corps rather than in the Army.\n\n ### U.S. Marine Corps\n\nHe enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1940, in Baltimore, Maryland. He went to recruit training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, followed by training at Marine Corps Base Quantico and New River. The Marines sent him to Guant\u00e1namo Bay for his next assignment and then to Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands as a member of \"D\" Company, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division.\n\n #### Guadalcanal\n\nOn October 24, 1942, during the Battle for Henderson Field, his unit came under attack by a regiment of about 3,000 soldiers from the Japanese Sendai Division using machine guns, grenades, and mortars against the American heavy machine guns. Basilone commanded two sections of machine guns which fought for the next two days until only Basilone and two other Marines were left standing. As the battle went on, ammunition became critically low. Despite their supply lines having been cut off by enemies who had infiltrated into the rear, Basilone fought through hostile ground to resupply his heavy machine gunners with urgently needed supplies. Basilone moved an extra gun into position and maintained continual fire against the incoming Japanese forces. He then repaired and manned another machine gun, holding the defensive line until relief arrived.\n\nWhen the last of the ammunition ran out shortly before dawn on the second day, Basilone, using his pistol and a machete, held off the Japanese soldiers attacking his position. By the end of the engagement, Japanese forces opposite the Marines' lines had been virtually annihilated. For his actions during the battle, Basilone received the United States military's highest award for valor, the Medal of Honor. Afterwards, Private First Class Nash W. Phillips of Fayetteville, North Carolina, recalled from the battle for Guadalcanal:\n\n> \"Basilone had a machine gun on the go for three days and nights without sleep, rest, or food. He was in a good emplacement, and causing the Japanese lots of trouble, not only firing his machine gun, but also using his pistol.\"\n\n #### War bond tours\n\nIn 1943, Basilone returned to the United States and participated in war bond tours. His arrival was highly publicized, and his hometown held a parade in his honor when he returned. The homecoming parade occurred on Sunday, September 19 and drew a huge crowd with thousands of people, including politicians, celebrities, and the national press. The parade made national news in Life magazine and Fox Movietone News. After the parade, Basilone toured the country raising money for the war effort and achieved celebrity status.\n\nAlthough he appreciated the admiration, he felt out of place and requested to return to the operating forces fighting the war. The Marine Corps denied his request and told him he was needed more on the home front. He was offered a commission, which he turned down, and was later offered an assignment as an instructor, but refused this as well. When he requested again to return to the war, the request was approved. He left for Camp Pendleton, California, for training on December 27. On July 3, 1944, he reenlisted in the Marine Corps.\n\n #### Marriage\n\nWhile stationed at Camp Pendleton, Basilone met his future wife, Lena Mae Riggi, who was a sergeant in the Marine Corps Women's Reserve. They were married at St. Mary's Star of the Sea Church in Oceanside, California, on July 10, 1944, with a reception at the Carlsbad Hotel. They honeymooned at an onion farm near Portland, Oregon.\n\n #### Iwo Jima and death\n\nAfter his request to return to the fleet was approved, Basilone was assigned to \"C\" Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Marine Regiment, 5th Marine Division. On February 19, 1945, the first day of the invasion of Iwo Jima, he was serving as a machine gun section leader on Red Beach II. While the Marines landed, the Japanese concentrated their fire at the incoming Marines from heavily fortified blockhouses staged throughout the island. With his unit pinned down, Basilone made his way around the side of the Japanese positions until he was directly on top of the blockhouse. He then attacked with grenades and demolitions, single-handedly destroying the entire strong point and its defending garrison.\n\nHe then fought his way toward Airfield Number 1 and aided a Marine tank that was trapped in an enemy mine field under intense mortar and artillery barrages. He guided the heavy vehicle over the hazardous terrain to safety, despite heavy weapons fire from the Japanese. As he moved along the edge of the airfield, he was killed by Japanese mortar shrapnel (based on his research for the book and miniseries The Pacific, author Hugh Ambrose suggested that Basilone was killed by a burst of small arms fire which hit him in the right groin and neck and nearly took off his left arm).\n\nHis actions helped Marines penetrate the Japanese defense and get off the landing beach during the critical early stages of the invasion. Basilone was posthumously awarded the Marine Corps' second-highest decoration for valor, the Navy Cross, for extraordinary heroism during the battle of Iwo Jima.\n\n #### Burial\n\nHe was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia. His widow, Lena M. Basilone, died on June 11, 1999, aged 86, and is buried at Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California. Lena's obituary notes that she never remarried and was buried still wearing her wedding ring.\n\n ## Awards and decorations\n\nGunnery Sergeant Basilone's military awards include:\n\n ### Medal of Honor citation\n\nBasilone's Medal of Honor citation reads as follows:\n\nThe President of the United States in the name of The Congress takes pride in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to\n\nfor service as set forth in the following CITATION:\n\n> For extraordinary heroism and conspicuous gallantry in action against enemy Japanese forces, above and beyond the call of duty, while serving with the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division in the Lunga Area, Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, on 24 and 25 October 1942. While the enemy was hammering at the Marines' defensive positions, Sgt. BASILONE, in charge of 2 sections of heavy machine guns, fought valiantly to check the savage and determined assault. In a fierce frontal attack with the Japanese blasting his guns with grenades and mortar fire, one of Sgt. BASILONE'S sections, with its gun crews, was put out of action, leaving only 2 men able to carry on. Moving an extra gun into position, he placed it in action, then, under continual fire, repaired another and personally manned it, gallantly holding his line until replacements arrived. A little later, with ammunition critically low and the supply lines cut off, Sgt. BASILONE, at great risk of his life and in the face of continued enemy attack, battled his way through hostile lines with urgently needed shells for his gunners, thereby contributing in large measure to the virtual annihilation of a Japanese regiment. His great personal valor and courageous initiative were in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.\n\n","h_score":1766931.1312500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":2822189,"revid":1170301544,"description":"US Marine Corps sergeant and Medal of Honor recipient (1916\u20131945)","categories":["1916 births","1945 deaths","American male boxers","American people of Italian descent","Battle of Iwo Jima","Burials at Arlington National Cemetery","Military personnel from Buffalo, New York","Military personnel from Maryland","Military personnel from New Jersey","People from Raritan, New Jersey","People from Reistertown, Maryland","Recipients of the Navy Cross (United States)","United States Army soldiers","United States Marine Corps Medal of Honor recipients","United States Marine Corps non-commissioned officers","United States Marine Corps personnel killed in World War II","World War II recipients of the Medal of Honor"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade: 8\n\n**Learning Objectives:**\n1.

It is difficult to believe that I have won four consecutive titles\", del Potro said, crediting coach Franco Dav\u00edn for his impressive run. \"He changed my game. He changed my mind. He changed everything. When I play and I see him in the stands, it gives me confidence. I can play relaxed.\" At the 2008 US Open, del Potro progressed to the third round, where he won his first match to five sets in the circuit against Gilles Simon to reach the round of 16. He went on to defeat Japanese teenager Kei Nishikori in straight sets. In the quarterfinals, he was stopped by eventual finalist Murray, losing after almost four hours. The defeat came after 23 consecutive victories: the second-longest winning streak in 2008 and the longest winning streak by a player outside the top 10 in the last 20 years. Del Potro was selected to play his first home-based Davis Cup tie, between Argentina and Russia. He won his first singles match against Davydenko in three sets. He also won the fifth and deciding match against Igor Andreev in straight sets, booking Argentina a place in the final. At the Japan Open, he made the final by defeating 11th seed Jarkko Nieminen, top seed and defending champion Ferrer, and fourth seed Richard Gasquet. He was defeated by Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych in the final. At the Madrid Masters, he lost in the quarterfinals in straight sets to Roger Federer. He reached the semifinals of his next tournament, the Swiss Indoors, before losing to countryman Nalbandian. He was beaten by Nalbandian again in his next tournament, this time it was in the second round of the Paris Masters. Del Potro blamed fatigue for his defeat, \"It's difficult to play the last tournament of the year. I was tired, my mind was in Argentina [the venue for the Davis Cup final]\". This left del Potro's qualification for the 2008 Tennis Masters Cup out of his hands, but Jo-Wilfried Tsonga beat James Blake in the semifinals, which was enough to ensure his place at the year-end event. Del Potro won one match at the Masters Cup, against Tsonga, but lost his other two matches against the higher-ranked Djokovic and Davydenko, meaning that he exited the tournament in the round-robin stage. This was his last event of the year on the ATP Tour. He went on to lose one match in the Davis Cup final, against L\u00f3pez, as his team succumbed to a 3\u20131 loss against Spain. He withdrew from his second match due to a thigh injury and was replaced by Jos\u00e9 Acasuso. Nonetheless, del Potro enjoyed a successful season; winning four titles and finishing 2008 as the youngest player in the top 10, top-ranked Argentine, and highest-ranked South American.","h_score":1872794.01875,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":3920935,"revid":1173374028,"description":"Argentine tennis player","categories":["1988 births","Argentine Roman Catholics","Argentine male tennis players","Argentine people of Italian descent","Grand Slam (tennis) champions in men's singles","Living people","Medalists at the 2012 Summer Olympics","Medalists at the 2016 Summer Olympics","Olympic bronze medalists for Argentina","Olympic medalists in tennis","Olympic silver medalists for Argentina","Olympic tennis players for Argentina","People from Tandil","Sportspeople from Buenos Aires Province","Tennis players at the 2012 Summer Olympics","Tennis players at the 2016 Summer Olympics","US Open (tennis) champions"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro: The Tower of Tandil's Epic Journey\n\nArgentine tennis star Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro rose to fame with his powerful forehand, winning the 2009 US Open and battling chronic injuries that defined his career.

On 11 January, he moved up to a career high world No. 4. He was scheduled to face Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on day 2 of the Kooyong Classic exhibition tournament, but withdrew due to a wrist injury.

On 4 May, del Potro took the option of having an operation to fix the injury. On 19 May, del Potro said he would not defend his US Open title, but if all went well, he would appear after the event, targeting the Paris Masters as a possible comeback. However, on 22 July, the USTA stated that del Potro was expected to defend his US Open crown. The player himself confirmed that his comeback to the tour would be the Thailand Open and said nothing about the New York event. On 2 August, del Potro returned to the practice courts. A week before the start of the US Open, after practicing for two weeks, del Potro withdrew from the event, for he felt he was not ready to compete at the highest level.\n\nAfter the nine-month break, del Potro confirmed that he would make his return at the Thailand Open.

Del Potro's biggest achievement is a major title: the 2009 US Open, where he defeated Rafael Nadal in the semifinals and the five-time defending champion Roger Federer in the final. He was the only man outside the Big Three (Novak Djokovic, Federer, and Nadal) to win a major between the 2005 Australian Open and the 2012 US Open, a span of 30 tournaments. Del Potro's other career highlights include reaching the 2018 US Open final, winning an Olympic bronze medal in men's singles at the 2012 London Olympics and the silver medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics, winning Indian Wells in 2018, and leading Argentina to the 2016 Davis Cup title; but his career has also been hampered by a succession of wrist and knee injuries.\n\nDel Potro first entered the top 10 of the ATP rankings on 6 October 2008. In January 2010, he reached a then-career-high ranking of world No. 4, after which he withdrew from most of the season due to an injury to his right wrist. In 2016, del Potro led Argentina to its first ever Davis Cup title by defeating Croatia's Marin \u010cili\u0107 in the final from two sets down. He reached his first major semifinal in four years by defeating Federer in the quarterfinals of the 2017 US Open. In 2018, he won his first Masters 1000 title at the Indian Wells Masters, defeating the defending champion and world No. 1 Federer in the final. After reaching the semifinals of the 2018 French Open, he matched his career-high ranking of No. 4, and in August 2018 he reached the world No. 3 ranking for the first time. At the 2018 US Open, he reached his second major final, where he lost to Novak Djokovic. Del Potro did not play between June 2019 and February 2022 because of pain from a knee injury, and said he would retire as a result. During his career del Potro won 22 ATP singles titles and one doubles title.\n\n ## Early life\n\nJuan Mart\u00edn del Potro was born in Tandil, Argentina. His father, Daniel del Potro (1957\u20132021), played rugby union in Argentina and was a veterinarian. His mother, Patricia Lucas, is a teacher, and he has a younger sister named Julieta. He also had an elder sister, who died in a car accident when she was eight years old. Del Potro speaks Spanish, English and some Italian.\n\nAside from tennis, he enjoys playing association football and supports the Boca Juniors team in Argentina and Juventus in Italy. He would often dedicate time to both sports during his youth, and Argentine-Italian international footballer Mauro Camoranesi, who grew up in the same town, remains a close friend of del Potro.\n\nDel Potro began playing tennis at the age of seven with coach Marcelo G\u00f3mez (who also coached Tandil-born players Juan M\u00f3naco, Mariano Zabaleta and M\u00e1ximo Gonz\u00e1lez). Del Potro's talent was discovered by Italian ex-tennis professional Ugo Colombini, who accompanied him through the initial phases of his young career, and is still today his agent and close friend. When questioned about his ambitions in tennis he replied, \"I dream of winning a Grand Slam and the Davis Cup.\" Despite refusing to participate in the Davis Cup several times, he has since achieved both goals. He is a Roman Catholic.\n\n ## Tennis career\n\n ### Junior years\n\nDel Potro played his first junior match in April 2003 at the age of 14 at a Grade-2 tournament in Italy. As a junior in 2002, del Potro won the Orange Bowl 14s title, beating Marin \u010cili\u0107 en route to a victory over Pavel Tchekov in the final. In 2003, at the age of 14, del Potro received wildcards to three ITF Circuit events in Argentina, where he lost in straight sets in the first round of each.\n\nAs a junior, del Potro reached as high as No. 3 in the combined junior world rankings, in January 2005.\n\nJunior Grand Slam performance - Singles:\n\nAustralian Open: A (-)\nFrench Open: QF (2005)\nWimbledon: 2R (2004)\nUS Open: 1R (2004)\n\n","h_score":1872794.01875,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":3920935,"revid":1173374028,"description":"Argentine tennis player","categories":["1988 births","Argentine Roman Catholics","Argentine male tennis players","Argentine people of Italian descent","Grand Slam (tennis) champions in men's singles","Living people","Medalists at the 2012 Summer Olympics","Medalists at the 2016 Summer Olympics","Olympic bronze medalists for Argentina","Olympic medalists in tennis","Olympic silver medalists for Argentina","Olympic tennis players for Argentina","People from Tandil","Sportspeople from Buenos Aires Province","Tennis players at the 2012 Summer Olympics","Tennis players at the 2016 Summer Olympics","US Open (tennis) champions"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 7\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

At Indian Wells in March, del Potro defeated Nikolay Davydenko, Bj\u00f6rn Phau, and Tommy Haas. In the quarterfinals, he beat Andy Murray for the second time in six matches. In the semifinals, he upset top seed and world No. 1 Djokovic, to end the Serb's streak of 22 victories. He then lost in the final to Rafael Nadal in three sets. Del Potro withdrew from most of the clay-court season and from the French Open due to a viral infection. On grass, del Potro began at the Queen's Club Championships, where he won his first comeback match in three sets against Xavier Malisse, who had achieved his biggest win at the Queens Club against Novak Djokovic in 2010. Del Potro came back from behind in the third set to take the match. He defeated Daniel Evans, only to be upset in the quarterfinals by Lleyton Hewitt. At Wimbledon, Del Potro won against Albert Ramos, Jesse Levine, and Grega \u017demlja before advancing past the fourth round for the first time in his career, thanks to a win over Andreas Seppi. He then played David Ferrer and, despite slipping badly during the fifth point of the match and aggravating a pre-existing leg injury, requiring over five minutes of treatment and by his own admission being close to forfeiting the match, he recovered to defeat Ferrer in straight sets to advance to his first Grand Slam semifinal since the 2009 US Open without dropping a set. On 5 July, Djokovic defeated him in five sets in 4 hours and 44 minutes, making it the longest semifinal in the history of Wimbledon men's singles.

At the Japan Open, Del Potro, who entered the tournament on a wildcard, beat Marcos Baghdatis, Carlos Berlocq, Alexandr Dolgopolov, and Nicolas Almagro before beating third seed Milos Raonic in two sets to win his third title of the year. In October, Del Potro reached the final of the Shanghai Rolex Masters, defeating Philipp Kohlschreiber, Tommy Haas, Nicol\u00e1s Almagro, and Rafael Nadal (for the first time since the semifinals of the 2009 US Open) en route, but eventually losing to defending champion Djokovic in a third-set tiebreak.

Cancellara's first victory came Tour M\u00e9diterran\u00e9en; he helped lead the Fassa Bortolo squad to victory in the race's final stage, which was a team time trial. On 6 April, Cancellara raced his first ever classic in the Tour of Flanders. He finished in the 73rd place and over ten minutes behind the winner. His next success came in the brief 3.4 kilometres (2.1 mi) prologue at the Tour de Romandie. Cancellara was a consistent finisher throughout the race and because of that, he won the points classification for the Tour de Romandie. Next, he won the stage four individual time trial at the Tour of Belgium by a margin of ten seconds over the second-place finisher. His final victory of the season came in the Tour de Suisse's prologue, where he beat out Spaniard \u00d3scar Pereiro by a little over a second for the win. Cancellara earned his first victory in 2004 at the Tour of Qatar. Cancellara won the race's fourth stage after attacking in the final kilometers of the race and then out-sprinting the riders who were able to keep pace with him to win the stage. His next victory came in the first stage of the Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme, where he won the opening stage's bunch sprint. Up next on the calendar for Cancellara was the Tour of Flanders. Cancellara crossed the line in 42nd place, just a little over two minutes after the winner Steffen Wesemann. The next weekend, he raced the Paris\u2013Roubaix for the second time. Cancellara showed great form during the race and was a member of the four-man group that was first to reach the finish line. He lost the sprint to the line and crossed the line in fourth. Cancellara's next success came in the Tour de Luxembourg, where he won the stage four individual time trial by fourteen seconds over the second-place finisher. He then went on to win his second Swiss National Time Trial Championship in late June. Cancellara's next success came at the Tour de France. He won the prologue around the Belgian city of Liege and took the first yellow jersey as leader of the general classification. Cancellara lost the lead after the second stage to Thor Hushovd. Cancellara did participate in both the time trial and road race at the Road World Championships. Cancellara performed well in the time trial and came in eighth place; he finished over two minutes behind the winner. He entered the men's road race four days later, but did not finish the course. Cancellara's first victory of the 2005 season came in the Paris\u2013Nice, where he won the fourth stage after out-sprinting his fellow breakaway member Jaan Kirsipuu for the stage win. Up next for Cancellara was the Setmana-Catalana. There he won the race's final stage, an individual time trial by seven seconds over American Tom Danielson. After Setmana-Catalana, he raced the Tour of Flanders and finished 42nd overall and over ten minutes behind the winner Tom Boonen. The next weekend, he raced Paris\u2013Roubaix where he finished in eighth place after a flat tire killed his chances of winning the race. Cancellara's next victory came in the Tour de Luxembourg, when he won the stage 3b individual time trial. He finished the Tour with the same time as the winner L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Bodrogi, but was given second overall by the organizers. After the Tour de Luxembourg, Cancellara won the Swiss National Time Trial Championship for the third time. Cancellara then started the Tour de France, but did not win any stages at the race. After the Tour, he then rode the HEW-Cyclassics where he finished in fourth place amidst the bunch sprint for the race win. Cancellara then competed in the road race and the time trial at the Road World Championships. Cancellara finished in third place in the time trial event and missed out on a silver second place medal by twelve hundredths of a second. Three days later, he finished the road race in 123rd place and over ten minutes behind the winner.","h_score":1754262.3687500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":3064125,"revid":1172496667,"description":"Swiss cyclist","categories":["1981 births","2010 Tour de France stage winners","2012 Tour de France stage winners","Cyclists at the 2004 Summer Olympics","Cyclists at the 2008 Summer Olympics","Cyclists at the 2012 Summer Olympics","Cyclists at the 2016 Summer Olympics","Danmark Rundt winners","Living people","Medalists at the 2008 Summer Olympics","Medalists at the 2016 Summer Olympics","Olympic cyclists for Switzerland","Olympic gold medalists for Switzerland","Olympic medalists in cycling","Olympic silver medalists for Switzerland","People from Bern-Mittelland District","Sportspeople from the canton of Bern","Swiss Tour de France stage winners","Swiss Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a stage winners","Swiss male cyclists","Swiss people of Italian descent","Tour de France prologue winners","Tour de Suisse stage winners","UCI Road World Champions (elite men)"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Fabian Cancellara?  \nA1: Fabian Cancellara is a retired Swiss professional cyclist.  \n\nQ2: What is his background?  \nA2: He was born in 1981 and started racing as a junior.  \n\nQ3: What are his major achievements?  \nA3: He won three world time trial titles and two Olympic golds.  \n\nQ4: Which races did he excel in?  \nA4: He dominated time trials and classics like Paris-Roubaix.  \n\nQ5: What was his riding style?  \nA5: He was known for powerful attacks and tactical skills.  \n\nQ6: When did he retire?  \nA6: Cancellara retired in 2016 after a successful career.  \n\nQ7: Did he face challenges?  \nA7: He dealt with injuries and intense competition.  \n\nQ8: What is his legacy?  \nA8: He is remembered as a top time trial specialist in cycling."}

In the video, Cassani showed a normal road bike on a stand and after he pressed a button, the pedals began to rotate. Cassani then alleged that a motor could easily be stowed in the seattube of the bike and the button to turn it on would be located on the handlebars. In the YouTube video, Cassani showed clips of Cancellara at the two races allegedly \"turning on\" the motor while riding and showing the drastic increase in speed. The claims caught steam since rumors were already going around about riders possibly using the new motor, the Gruber Assist, which could produce 100 Watts of power to aid the rider. Critics of the motor-theory often say that the Gruber Assist was way too noisy that time and in solo ride or a smaller group it could have surely been heard when turned on.\n\nThe Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) stated that whilst they are not investigating any specific teams or riders, it would review the need for a new bicycle inspection system to detect such cheating. Then UCI stated that there was no case against Cancellara after the claims gained prominence. Cancellara dismissed Cassani's claims saying that they were \"stupid\" and far too risky to do. He even told the Belgian newspaper Het Nieuwsblad that he had \"never had batteries on [his] bike.\"\n\nDuring an April 2017 press conference, just before his final Ronde van Vlaanderen, Tom Boonen was asked if it was always the strongest rider who wins the Tour of Flanders. \"Yes, most of the time\", he said. \"In every race like that, it is not always the strongest that wins, but most of the time it is. In Flanders, I can't really recall one year... Well, I can recall one year...\" When asked what year he was referring to, Boonen smiled and replied \"No comment\". On 6 April, two days before the 2018 Paris\u2013Roubaix, Samu\u00ebl Grulois of Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Belge Francophone (RTBF) asked Boonen if he believed Cancellara had used a motor to beat him in 2010: \"Did Cancellara steal the 2010 Flanders due to a motor? Is there any doubt?\" Boonen replied \"Yes\", and added \"But it's not for me to say. I finished second, and it's not the one in second who has to say the situation is not normal. It's very difficult to prove because we do not have the bike to check. It's too late\".\n\n","h_score":1754262.3687500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":3064125,"revid":1172496667,"description":"Swiss cyclist","categories":["1981 births","2010 Tour de France stage winners","2012 Tour de France stage winners","Cyclists at the 2004 Summer Olympics","Cyclists at the 2008 Summer Olympics","Cyclists at the 2012 Summer Olympics","Cyclists at the 2016 Summer Olympics","Danmark Rundt winners","Living people","Medalists at the 2008 Summer Olympics","Medalists at the 2016 Summer Olympics","Olympic cyclists for Switzerland","Olympic gold medalists for Switzerland","Olympic medalists in cycling","Olympic silver medalists for Switzerland","People from Bern-Mittelland District","Sportspeople from the canton of Bern","Swiss Tour de France stage winners","Swiss Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a stage winners","Swiss male cyclists","Swiss people of Italian descent","Tour de France prologue winners","Tour de Suisse stage winners","UCI Road World Champions (elite men)"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Fabian Cancellara?  \nA1: Fabian Cancellara is a Swiss cycling legend, known for dominating time trials and classics.  \n\nQ2: When and where was he born?  \nA2: Born in 1981 in Wohlen, Switzerland, he started racing young.  \n\nQ3: What are his major achievements?  \nA3: He won three world time trial titles and multiple Tour de France stages, shining like a Swiss clock.  \n\nQ4: How did he ride in races?  \nA4: With powerhouse pedaling and tactical flair, he often surged ahead in cobbled classics.  \n\nQ5: Did he compete in the Olympics?  \nA5: Yes, he claimed gold in time trials in 2008 and 2016, etching his name in history.  \n\nQ6: What made his style unique?  \nA6: His blend of strength and strategy turned him into a one-man breakaway machine.  \n\nQ7: When did he retire?  \nA7: He retired in 2016, leaving fans nostalgic for his epic rides.  \n\nQ8: What's his legacy in cycling?  \nA8: Cancellara inspired a generation with his grit, now sharing wisdom as a mentor."}

He gained the lead after the race's final stage and won the race without winning a single stage. In late March, Cancellara won the E3 Prijs Vlaanderen after riding away from Boonen and Juan Antonio Flecha with about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) remaining in the race. On 4 April he raced the famed Tour of Flanders. Cancellara first attacked in the race on the Molenberg with about 44 kilometres (27.3 mi) remaining in the race and only Boonen was able to mark his efforts. Cancellara's second major attack took place on the steepest part of the Muur van Geraardsbergen. The attack proved successful as he was able to drop Boonen and solo on to the victory. By winning the Tour of Flanders, he became the twelfth cyclist to win the opening three monuments of the cycling year \u2013 Milan\u2013San Remo, Tour of Flanders, and the Paris\u2013Roubaix \u2013 in a career. After winning the Tour of Flanders, Cancellara stated that he wished to win the other two cycling monuments: the Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge and the Giro di Lombardia. Just a week after his victory at the Tour of Flanders, Cancellara raced the Paris\u2013Roubaix. Cancellara made a move during the Mons-en-P\u00e9v\u00e8le portion of the race with more than 50 kilometres (31.1 mi) to go in the race and no one was able to match his efforts. Cancellara then rode solo all the way to the finish in the Roubaix Velodrome and finished two minutes ahead the second-place finisher Thor Hushovd. After winning the Roubaix, Cancellara decided to skip the rest of the classics to race the Tour of California as part of his warm up for the Tour de France. He completed the Tour of California without winning a single stage. Cancellara's next victory came at the Tour de Suisse where he won the prologue, which was an individual time trial around the city of Lugano. Cancellara came close to another stage win in the stage nine individual time trial, but fell short by seventeen seconds. Next, Cancellara won the prologue of the Tour de France. He then held the lead until the second stage came to an end, after stage winner Sylvain Chavanel took it away. However, Cancellara regained the lead the after the next day and held it until stage seven when Chavanel again took the lead. Later in the Tour, Cancellara won the stage nineteen individual time trial that stretched from Bordeaux to Pauillac by seventeen seconds over German rider Tony Martin. The Road World Championships took place in Melbourne and Cancellara returned to the event to defend his title as world champion of the time trial discipline. He won the time trial by over a minute to the second-place finisher and in doing so, he became the first four-time men's world champion of the time trial. Four days later, he competed in the road race and finished 50th overall.","h_score":1754262.3687500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":3064125,"revid":1172496667,"description":"Swiss cyclist","categories":["1981 births","2010 Tour de France stage winners","2012 Tour de France stage winners","Cyclists at the 2004 Summer Olympics","Cyclists at the 2008 Summer Olympics","Cyclists at the 2012 Summer Olympics","Cyclists at the 2016 Summer Olympics","Danmark Rundt winners","Living people","Medalists at the 2008 Summer Olympics","Medalists at the 2016 Summer Olympics","Olympic cyclists for Switzerland","Olympic gold medalists for Switzerland","Olympic medalists in cycling","Olympic silver medalists for Switzerland","People from Bern-Mittelland District","Sportspeople from the canton of Bern","Swiss Tour de France stage winners","Swiss Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a stage winners","Swiss male cyclists","Swiss people of Italian descent","Tour de France prologue winners","Tour de Suisse stage winners","UCI Road World Champions (elite men)"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Fabian Cancellara?  \nA1: He's a Swiss cycling legend, nicknamed Spartacus, known for dominating time trials and classics.\n\nQ2: What sparked his cycling career?  \nA2: Growing up in Switzerland, he started racing young, honing his powerhouse legs on hilly roads.\n\nQ3: What are his major wins?  \nA3: He claimed three world time trial titles and multiple Tour de France stages, plus Olympic gold.\n\nQ4: Why the Spartacus nickname?  \nA4: His gladiatorial strength and tactical prowess evoked the ancient warrior, battling rivals with iron will.\n\nQ5: How did he handle cycling's demands?  \nA5: With fierce training and mental grit, he balanced family life amid the peloton's grueling pace.\n\nQ6: What challenges did he face?  \nA6: Injuries and doping scandals shadowed his path, yet he pedaled on with unyielding resilience.\n\nQ7: What's his legacy in cycling?  \nA7: He revolutionized time trialing with aerodynamic flair, inspiring a new generation of riders.\n\nQ8: How has he influenced modern racing?  \nA8: Beyond wins, his sportsmanship and tech innovations, like better bike designs, reshaped the sport's future."}

After finishing the aforementioned tours, he raced the Strade Bianche and finished in fourth place. Next, Cancellara raced the Tirreno\u2013Adriatico. He came close to a stage victory in the race's stage seven individual time trial, but missed the win by twelve seconds. Just five days later, Cancellara lined up at the Milan\u2013San Remo, where he was considered by many as a favorite to win the race. The race was marred by poor weather conditions, but Cancellara remained near the front and managed to place third overall after losing out in the sprint for the finish line. His first win of the year came in E3 Harelbeke, after an attack on Oude Kwaremont, with 35 km (22 mi) remaining of the race. His victory at E3 Harelbeke solidified him as a contender for the upcoming Tour of Flanders. On the last lap of the Tour of Flanders, Cancellara attacked on Oude Kwaremont and only Peter Sagan was able to match Cancellara's move. Together, the two rode to the last remaining escapee in the front of the race. Cancellara then attacked on the Paterberg hill with about 13 km (8 mi) remaining. Cancellara's attack was successful and he powered on solo into the finish and won his second Tour of Flanders. After the Tour of Flanders, Cancellara started in the Scheldeprijs in Belgium. During the race, he crashed after 50 km (31 mi) but finished the race. The next day, Cancellara fell while riding on the Waindignies-Hamage cobbled sector of the Paris\u2013Roubaix. Despite the crashes, many still considered Fabian Cancellara the favorite to win the Paris\u2013Roubaix. During the Paris\u2013Roubaix on 7 April, Cancellara was attacked multiple times by his competitors, but managed to counter all their attacks. With about 16 km (10 mi) to go, Cancellara made a move that only Sep Vanmarcke and Zden\u011bk \u0160tybar could follow. \u0160tybar was dropped after colliding with a spectator, leaving Cancellara and Vanmarcke to ride to the finish. Cancellara outsprinted Vanmarcke at the finish on the Roubaix velodome to claim his third Paris\u2013Roubaix win. After the race, Cancellara stated that he would enter neither the Giro d'Italia or the Tour de France, but instead ride the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a in order to prepare for the UCI Road World Championships. On 7 June 2013 it was announced that Cancellara would ride the Tour of Austria. The next race he started was the Tour de Suisse.

Cancellara managed to hold his fifth place overall to the race's finish that ended in front of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Next, Cancellara began the Tour of Qatar, where his highest stage finish, fourth place, came during the race's third stage, an individual time trial. He finished the race in 67th overall in the general classification. On 18 February, Cancellara started the Tour of Oman. Five days later, he completed the race in thirty-first place overall.

It was announced on 1 July 2013 that Cancellara signed a three-year deal with Trek, effective on 1 January 2014 and up to and including the 2016 season. After a short hiatus from racing, Cancellara lined up for the Tour of Austria on 30 June. He won the stage 7 individual time trial by a margin of 22 seconds over the second-place finisher, before completing the race the next day. On Friday 26 July, Cancellara attended the formal team presentation Tour de Pologne. The next day, he finished over sixteen minutes behind the stage winner in the first leg of the race. He finished second on stage seven's 37 km (23.0 mi) time trial, 56 seconds behind stage winner Bradley Wiggins. Cancellara went in hoping to win the time trial, and the second-place finish on the stage left him disappointed. Cancellara entered the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a and helped assist RadioShack-Leopard to a second-place finish in the race's opening team time trial. He won the stage eleven individual time trial by a margin of 37 seconds over reigning world champion Tony Martin. Cancellara then rode in support of team leader and eventual Vuelta winner Chris Horner until the seventeenth stage, after which he left the race in order to focus on the World Championships. Cancellara was seen as a contender for the gold medal in both the men's time trial and road race events at the UCI Road World Championships. Cancellara finished the time trial in third position, 48 seconds behind the winner Tony Martin, earning a bronze medal. Four days after completing the time trial event, Cancellara entered the Elite Men's road race. For most of the race, Cancellara stayed near the front of race, before being dropped however on the final climb of the day and fighting his way to tenth place.

This was his second victory in a row in the prologue at the Tour of California. Cancellara then returned to the Tirreno\u2013Adriatico, but an injury prevented his efforts to repeat as winner of the event. Cancellara did not finish the sixth stage of the race; he left the event without winning a single stage. Poor performance marred the early portion of the season for Cancellara as he achieved no success in the early season classics; he did not finish the Tour of Flanders after suffering problem with his bike chain early in the race, on the Koppenberg, and he finished 49th overall in the Paris\u2013Roubaix.\n\nCancellara began to achieve success in June, during the Tour de Suisse. He won the opening time trial of the race and the time trial on stage nine en route to his overall victory. In addition to the general classification, he also won the secondary points classification of the Tour de Suisse. A week after finishing the Tour de Suisse, he won his first Swiss national road racing crown on 28 June after outsprinting Mathias Frank at the line. He continued to win in July, as he won the opening stage of the Tour de France and took the first yellow jersey of the race. He then successfully defended the lead until the seventh stage, when he was unable to bridge the gap to the leaders on the Arcalis mountain-top finish.\n\nCancellara's next victories season came at the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a. He won the opening time trial and then held the lead of the race until the race's fourth stage. Cancellara briefly regained the lead of the race after winning the time trial on stage seven, but he lost the lead after the next stage's conclusion.\n\nThe Road World Championships took place in Cancellara's native country Switzerland and he stated that he wished to win both events. Cancellara dominated the time trial event and won by a margin of close a minute and a half over the second-place finisher. This was Cancellara's third world championship in the time trial discipline, which was tied for most ever with Australia's Michael Rogers. Cancellara's next goal was the road race, which was to take place three days later. During the final lap of the race, Cancellara crossed the gap to the race's leading group that had just formed. At the bottom of the final climb Cadel Evans (Australia) attacked, but no other riders reacted.

He was born in Wohlen bei Bern, Switzerland. Cancellara began road cycling after falling in love with an old bike at the age of thirteen. After that, he began to take the sport more seriously and won two consecutive World Junior Time Trial Championships in 1998 and 1999. At age nineteen he turned professional and signed with the team, where he rode as a stagiaire. He is known for being a quality time trialist, a one-day classics specialist, and a workhorse for his teammates who have general classification aspirations.\n\nAfter winning a few stages and small races in his starting years, Cancellara earned his first major victory at the 2004 Tour de France where he won the opening prologue time trial and wore the race leader yellow jersey for one day. The following season saw fewer victories, but his 2006 season saw a victory in the men's time trial at the UCI Road World Championships, along with victory at the Paris\u2013Roubaix. Cancellara repeated as world champion in the time trial the next year, along with winning two stages at the Tour de France.\n\nDuring the 2008 calendar he won gold at the Summer Olympics in the individual time trial event and the Milan\u2013San Remo. The next season saw Cancellara again become world time trial champion and lead both the Tour de France and the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a. In 2010, he won the Paris\u2013Roubaix and the Tour of Flanders. Cancellara's 2011 and 2012 campaigns were both short in number of victories, while the latter was hampered by injuries throughout. After a lackluster two-year period, Cancellara again won the Tour of Flanders and Paris\u2013Roubaix double in 2013. In 2014, Cancellara repeated as winner of the Tour of Flanders.\n\nSince turning professional in 2000, Cancellara has ridden for four professional teams. He has achieved great success in the classic monuments; he has won Paris\u2013Roubaix three times, the Milan\u2013San Remo once, and the Tour of Flanders three times. Cancellara has won the opening stage of the Tour de France five times and has led the race for 29 days total, which is the most of any rider who has not won the Tour. His success has not been limited to just time trials and classics, as he has won general classification of the Tirreno\u2013Adriatico, Tour de Suisse, and the Tour of Oman. In 2008, he won gold in the individual time trial and silver in the men's road race at the Summer Olympics. In 2016, he won Olympic gold in the individual time trial for the second time in his career. In addition, Cancellara has been the time trial world champion four times in his career.\n\n ## Early life and amateur career\n\nFabian Cancellara was born on 18 March 1981, in Wohlen bei Bern, Switzerland, to a Swiss mother and an Italian Swiss father. He discovered cycling at the age of 13 after falling in love with an old family bike that he had found in the garage and immediately gave up football to concentrate on cycling. In addition, Cancellara excelled at cross-country skiing during his youth.\n\nCancellara's cycling skills began to blossom at an early age, when he impressed as a time trialist and dominated Swiss junior cycling. Yvan Girard, Swiss national junior team coach from 1997 to 2005, was quoted saying that Cancellara was \"head and shoulders above everyone else\" in the time trials. He won the junior World Time Trial Championship in both 1998 and 1999 and at the age of 19 he came in second at the 2000 U-23 World Time Trial Championship.\n\n ## Professional career\n\n ### 2000\u20132002: The beginning years\n\nAfter his second-place finish at the Under-23 time trial championship, Cancellara turned professional with , which was one of the strongest teams in the world at the time. Cancellara rode as a stagiaire for the team in late 2000 before joining the team for the 2001 season as a member of the \"Young Riders Project\". Cancellara's first victory as a professional came at the prologue of the Tour of Rhodes, where he also won the overall final general classification.\n\nFor 2002 the Mapei team split into two formations per UCI regulations, the \"Top Team\" with 25 riders and the GS-III \"Gruppo Giovani\" (youth group) to develop young talents, which Cancellara joined with other riders including Filippo Pozzato, Michael Rogers and Bernhard Eisel. Giorgio Squinzi, the head of Mapei firm, later said in an interview with La Gazzetta dello Sport that he took Cancellara and Pozzato all the way from the Junior category to Mapei's top team, in order to let them avoid the Under-23 category where he suggested that doping was even worse than among professionals. Squinzi also said that Cancellara was going to be \"The future Miguel Indur\u00e1in\". During his two seasons with Mapei, Cancellara used his time trialling skills to great effect, winning several individual time trials and a total of eleven victories.\n\n","h_score":1754262.3687500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":3064125,"revid":1172496667,"description":"Swiss cyclist","categories":["1981 births","2010 Tour de France stage winners","2012 Tour de France stage winners","Cyclists at the 2004 Summer Olympics","Cyclists at the 2008 Summer Olympics","Cyclists at the 2012 Summer Olympics","Cyclists at the 2016 Summer Olympics","Danmark Rundt winners","Living people","Medalists at the 2008 Summer Olympics","Medalists at the 2016 Summer Olympics","Olympic cyclists for Switzerland","Olympic gold medalists for Switzerland","Olympic medalists in cycling","Olympic silver medalists for Switzerland","People from Bern-Mittelland District","Sportspeople from the canton of Bern","Swiss Tour de France stage winners","Swiss Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a stage winners","Swiss male cyclists","Swiss people of Italian descent","Tour de France prologue winners","Tour de Suisse stage winners","UCI Road World Champions (elite men)"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade 6\n\n**Learning Objectives:**  \n1.

The local governor, a Turk named Nasr al-Dawla Aftakin, opposed al-Afdal, so Nizar was quickly able to gain his support. He also won over the local judge (qadi), the inhabitants and the surrounding Arab tribes to his cause. He then rose in revolt and proclaimed himself imam and caliph with the title of al-Mustafa li-Din Allah ('the Chosen One for God's Religion'). A gold dinar of Nizar, bearing this title, was discovered in 1994, attesting to his assumption of the caliphal title and the minting of coinage with it. According to Walker, the speed with which Nizar gained support, and some other stories narrated in al-Maqrizi, suggest the existence of a relatively large faction that expected or wanted him to succeed al-Mustansir.\n\nNizar's revolt was initially successful: al-Afdal's attack on Alexandria in February 1095 was easily repulsed, and Nizar's forces raided up to the outskirts of Cairo. Over the next months, however, al-Afdal managed to win back the allegiance of the Arab tribes with bribes and gifts. Weakened, Nizar's forces were pushed back to Alexandria, which was placed under siege. In November, Nizar's military commander Ibn Masal abandoned the city, taking most of the remaining treasure with him. This forced Aftakin and Nizar to surrender against a guarantee of their safety (aman). Both were taken back to Cairo, where Nizar was immured and Aftakin was executed. The details or exact date of Nizar's death are unknown.\n\nIn a surviving letter sent to the Isma'ili Yemeni queen Arwa al-Sulayhi announcing his accession, al-Musta'li gives the \"official\" version of events as follows: Like the other sons of al-Mustansir, Nizar had at first accepted his imamate and paid him homage, before being moved by greed and envy to revolt.

However, no formal designation of Nizar as heir seems to have taken place by the time of al-Mustansir's death in December 1094. Al-Maqrizi writes that this was due to the machinations of Badr's son al-Afdal Shahanshah, who had succeeded his father to the vizierate in June 1094. According to al-Maqrizi, a deep-seated enmity existed between al-Afdal and Nizar. An anecdote tells how al-Afdal had once tried to enter the palace on horseback\u2014a privilege reserved for the caliph\u2014whereupon Nizar yelled at him to dismount and called him a \"dirty Armenian\". Since then, the two had been bitter enemies, with al-Afdal obstructing Nizar's activities and demoting his servants, while at the same time winning the army's commanders over to his cause. Only one of them, the Berber Muhammad ibn Masal al-Lukki, is said to have remained loyal to Nizar, because he had promised to appoint him vizier instead of al-Afdal. According to al-Maqrizi, al-Afdal pressured al-Mustansir to prevent Nizar's public nomination as heir, and when the caliph died, al-Afdal raised a much younger half-brother of Nizar, al-Musta'li, to the throne and the imamate. Al-Musta'li, who had shortly before married al-Afdal's sister, was completely dependent on al-Afdal for his accession. This made him a compliant figurehead who was unlikely to threaten al-Afdal's recent, and therefore as yet fragile, hold on power. In order to defend al-Musta'li's succession and counter the claims of Nizar's partisans, al-Mu'stali's son and successor, al-Amir, issued the al-Hidaya al-Amiriyya. This document puts a different spin on the dispersal of the princes: supposedly, they were sent away in order of importance, with those closest to Cairo (and thus the caliph himself) being the highest in rank. Modern historians point out that this was a deliberately misconstrued argument, as the princes were sent away for their protection. According to the historian Paul E. Walker, sending Abu Abdallah to the strong army of Badr al-Jamali was, if anything, an indication of his high importance and of his father's desire to keep him safe. At the same time, the unidentified underage son left in Cairo was clearly not al-Musta'li, who had not even been born yet. Walker identifies the unnamed prince with Abu'l-Qasim Ahmad, whose birth had been publicly announced in 1060.","h_score":1759085.51875,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":10811647,"revid":1171604300,"description":"Fatimid prince and Nizari imam (1045\u20131095)","categories":["1045 births","1095 deaths","11th-century Arab people","11th-century Ismailis","11th-century caliphs","11th-century executions","11th-century monarchs in Africa","11th-century people from the Fatimid Caliphate","Egyptian Ismailis","Heirs apparent who never acceded","Medieval Alexandria","Nizari imams","People executed by the Fatimid Caliphate","Rebels of the medieval Islamic world","Royalty from Cairo","Schisms in Islam","Sons of Fatimid caliphs"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Nizar ibn al-Mustansir?  \nA1: Nizar was a Fatimid prince, son of Caliph al-Mustansir, born in the 11th century.  \n\nQ2: What was his family background?  \nA2: He hailed from the Ismaili Shia dynasty, part of a powerful Egyptian caliphate lineage.  \n\nQ3: Why is he historically significant?  \nA3: Nizar sparked a major succession dispute after his father's death in 1094.  \n\nQ4: What caused the Nizari schism?  \nA4: His exclusion from the throne led to a split in Ismailism, forming the Nizari branch.  \n\nQ5: How did the dispute unfold?  \nA5: Supporters rallied for Nizar against his brother, creating lasting factional rivalries.  \n\nQ6: What was his legacy in Islam?  \nA6: He inspired the enduring Nizari Ismaili community, like a ripple in history's stream.  \n\nQ7: How does he compare to other caliphal heirs?  \nA7: Unlike many, Nizar's claim fueled a persistent sect, blending tragedy with transformation.  \n\nQ8: What relevance does he hold today?  \nA8: His story echoes in modern Ismaili practices, a testament to faith's resilient threads."}

When his father died in December 1094, the powerful vizier, al-Afdal Shahanshah, raised Nizar's younger brother al-Musta'li to the throne in Cairo, bypassing the claims of Nizar and other older sons of al-Mustansir. Nizar escaped Cairo, rebelled and seized Alexandria, where he reigned as caliph with the regnal name al-Mustafa li-Din Allah (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u0637\u0641\u0649 \u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647, romanized: al-Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 li-D\u012bn All\u0101h). In late 1095 he was defeated and taken prisoner to Cairo, where he was executed by immurement.\n\nDuring the 12th century, some of Nizar's actual or claimed descendants tried, without success, to seize the throne from the Fatimid caliphs. Many Isma'ilis, especially in Persia, rejected al-Musta'li's imamate and considered Nizar as the rightful imam. As a result, they split off from the Fatimid regime and founded the Nizari branch of Isma'ilism, with their own line of imams who claimed descent from Nizar. This line continues to this day in the person of the Aga Khan.\n\n","h_score":1759085.51875,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":10811647,"revid":1171604300,"description":"Fatimid prince and Nizari imam (1045\u20131095)","categories":["1045 births","1095 deaths","11th-century Arab people","11th-century Ismailis","11th-century caliphs","11th-century executions","11th-century monarchs in Africa","11th-century people from the Fatimid Caliphate","Egyptian Ismailis","Heirs apparent who never acceded","Medieval Alexandria","Nizari imams","People executed by the Fatimid Caliphate","Rebels of the medieval Islamic world","Royalty from Cairo","Schisms in Islam","Sons of Fatimid caliphs"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 10\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

The al-Hidaya al-Amiriyya and other accounts further assert the legitimacy of al-Musta'li's accession by reporting stories that on the wedding banquet of al-Musta'li, or on his deathbed, al-Mustansir had chosen him as his heir, and that one of al-Mustansir's sisters is said to have been called to him privately and received al-Musta'li's nomination as a bequest. Modern historians, such as Farhad Daftary, believe these stories to be most likely attempts to justify and retroactively legitimize what was in effect a coup d'\u00e9tat by al-Afdal. However, al-Maqrizi also includes a different narrative that casts doubt on whether al-Afdal's move was really a carefully prepared coup. When al-Afdal summoned three of al-Mustansir's sons\u2014Nizar, Abdallah, and Isma'il, apparently the most prominent among the caliph's progeny\u2014to the palace to do homage to al-Musta'li, who had been seated on the throne, they each refused. Not only did they reject al-Musta'li, but each of them claimed that al-Mustansir had chosen him as his successor. Nizar claimed that he had a written document to this effect. This refusal apparently took al-Afdal completely by surprise. The brothers were allowed to leave the palace; but while Abdallah and Isma'il made for a nearby mosque, Nizar immediately fled Cairo. To add to the confusion, having learned of al-Mustansir's passing, Baraqat, the chief missionary (da'i) of Cairo (the head of the Isma'ili religious establishment) proclaimed Abdallah as caliph with the regnal name al-Muwaffaq. However, al-Afdal soon regained control. Baraqat was arrested (and later executed), Abdallah and Isma'il were placed under surveillance and eventually publicly acknowledged al-Musta'li. A grand assembly of officials was held, which acclaimed al-Musta'li as imam and caliph.","h_score":1759085.51875,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":10811647,"revid":1171604300,"description":"Fatimid prince and Nizari imam (1045\u20131095)","categories":["1045 births","1095 deaths","11th-century Arab people","11th-century Ismailis","11th-century caliphs","11th-century executions","11th-century monarchs in Africa","11th-century people from the Fatimid Caliphate","Egyptian Ismailis","Heirs apparent who never acceded","Medieval Alexandria","Nizari imams","People executed by the Fatimid Caliphate","Rebels of the medieval Islamic world","Royalty from Cairo","Schisms in Islam","Sons of Fatimid caliphs"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 8th Grade\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

However, no formal designation of Nizar as heir seems to have taken place by the time of al-Mustansir's death in December 1094. Al-Maqrizi writes that this was due to the machinations of Badr's son al-Afdal Shahanshah, who had succeeded his father to the vizierate in June 1094. According to al-Maqrizi, a deep-seated enmity existed between al-Afdal and Nizar. An anecdote tells how al-Afdal had once tried to enter the palace on horseback\u2014a privilege reserved for the caliph\u2014whereupon Nizar yelled at him to dismount and called him a \"dirty Armenian\". Since then, the two had been bitter enemies, with al-Afdal obstructing Nizar's activities and demoting his servants, while at the same time winning the army's commanders over to his cause. Only one of them, the Berber Muhammad ibn Masal al-Lukki, is said to have remained loyal to Nizar, because he had promised to appoint him vizier instead of al-Afdal. According to al-Maqrizi, al-Afdal pressured al-Mustansir to prevent Nizar's public nomination as heir, and when the caliph died, al-Afdal raised a much younger half-brother of Nizar, al-Musta'li, to the throne and the imamate. Al-Musta'li, who had shortly before married al-Afdal's sister, was completely dependent on al-Afdal for his accession. This made him a compliant figurehead who was unlikely to threaten al-Afdal's recent, and therefore as yet fragile, hold on power. In order to defend al-Musta'li's succession and counter the claims of Nizar's partisans, al-Mu'stali's son and successor, al-Amir, issued the al-Hidaya al-Amiriyya. This document puts a different spin on the dispersal of the princes: supposedly, they were sent away in order of importance, with those closest to Cairo (and thus the caliph himself) being the highest in rank. Modern historians point out that this was a deliberately misconstrued argument, as the princes were sent away for their protection. According to the historian Paul E. Walker, sending Abu Abdallah to the strong army of Badr al-Jamali was, if anything, an indication of his high importance and of his father's desire to keep him safe. At the same time, the unidentified underage son left in Cairo was clearly not al-Musta'li, who had not even been born yet. Walker identifies the unnamed prince with Abu'l-Qasim Ahmad, whose birth had been publicly announced in 1060.","h_score":1759085.51875,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":10811647,"revid":1171604300,"description":"Fatimid prince and Nizari imam (1045\u20131095)","categories":["1045 births","1095 deaths","11th-century Arab people","11th-century Ismailis","11th-century caliphs","11th-century executions","11th-century monarchs in Africa","11th-century people from the Fatimid Caliphate","Egyptian Ismailis","Heirs apparent who never acceded","Medieval Alexandria","Nizari imams","People executed by the Fatimid Caliphate","Rebels of the medieval Islamic world","Royalty from Cairo","Schisms in Islam","Sons of Fatimid caliphs"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade 8\n\n**Learning Objectives:**\n1.

In between seasons, he amicably parted from his longtime coach Priscilla Hill, and replaced her with Galina Zmievskaya, who had coached 1992 Olympic champion Viktor Petrenko and Weir's idol Oksana Baiul. Weir hired Zmievskaya because he needed more than Hill's \"nurturing approach\" and that Zmievskaya's \"drill sergeant-like demands for discipline and rigor\" would help him grow and win championships again. He also changed his choreographer and training routine, and moved out of his family home in Newark, Delaware to an apartment in New Jersey in order to train with Zmievskaya. He told reporters that he felt homesick and nervous moving to a large city and living on his own for the first time in his life, resorting to sleeping with a kitchen knife next to his bed. He also said that the move taught him discipline and independence. He worked on including a quadruple toe loop in his programs, and on making his triple Lutz and triple flip bigger. He designed his own costumes and worked closely with his choreographers again. He worked with choreographers Faye Kitariev and Viktor Petukhov to compose a Russian rock opera based upon Svetlana Pikous' song, \"Yunona I Avos.\" For his free skating program, he worked with Yoav Goren of the pop group Globus, who helped him create a routine to the group's song, \"Love is War\". Weir called the costume he wore for his free skating program \"a sparkly onesie\"; Sports Illustrated described it as \"another of his bifurcated black and white, rhinestone-studded costumes with plunging backline\". According to figure skating reporter Elvin Walker, Weir demonstrated a desire to win and a new passion for skating throughout the season, skating with an intensity he lacked in previous seasons. He was ranked seventh-best skater in the world. At Cup of China, Weir came in second place, after Lysacek, in the short program, with 79.80 points. He did not include a quadruple jump but completed a triple lutz-triple toe loop combination and had higher-scoring spins than Lysacek. He came in first place in the free skate, with 151.98 points and \"a nearly perfect\" performance. He earned 231.78 points overall, and \"significantly beat\" his personal best scores. Lysacek came in second place, and two-time world champion, St\u00e9phane Lambiel from Switzerland, came in third. Weir also won the gold medal at Cup of Russia, beating Lambiel by over 11 points. He came in first place in the free skate, which was described as \"somewhat business-like and more suited for the strong technicians rather than the artistic skater Weir is known to be\". He opened his program with a strong triple Axel-triple toe loop combination and underrotated his triple Axel, but successfully completed five more clean triple jumps.","h_score":1758091.2562500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1352814,"revid":1164783045,"description":"American figure skater and commentator (born 1984)","categories":["1984 births","21st-century American memoirists","21st-century American writers","American LGBT sportspeople","American autobiographers","American male single skaters","American memoirists","American people of Norwegian descent","Competitors at the 2001 Goodwill Games","Eurovision commentators","Fantasy on Ice main cast members","Figure skaters at the 2006 Winter Olympics","Figure skaters at the 2010 Winter Olympics","Figure skating commentators","Gay sportsmen","LGBT figure skaters","LGBT people from Delaware","LGBT people from Pennsylvania","Living people","Olympic Games broadcasters","Olympic figure skaters for the United States","Participants in American reality television series","People from Lyndhurst, New Jersey","People from Newark, Delaware","Sportspeople from Delaware","Sportspeople from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania","Sportspeople from New Castle County, Delaware","University of Delaware alumni","World Figure Skating Championships medalists","World Junior Figure Skating Championships medalists"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Johnny Weir?  \nA1: Johnny Weir is an American figure skater and TV personality.  \n\nQ2: When and where was he born?  \nA2: He was born on July 2, 1984, in Coatesville, Pennsylvania.  \n\nQ3: When did he start figure skating?  \nA3: He began skating at age 12.

Longman also called Weir's free skate \"oddly passive and stumbling\". Weir accomplished three clean triple jumps, but he popped his planned second triple Axel and struggled completing the final jump of his triple-triple combination jump. He came in fifth place in the free skate, but his short program, which was the third-best with 83.51 points, kept him in medal position. Weir, along with first-place finisher Jeremy Abbott and Lysacek, who came in second place, were sent to the 2010 Winter Olympics; they were considered the strongest U.S. Olympic men's team since the 1980s. Weir came into the Olympics \"a legitimate medal threat\", although he did not anticipate winning a medal and suspected that it would mark the end of his competitive career. He stayed at the Olympic Village in Vancouver, despite wanting to stay at a hotel, for security reasons. He had received \"very serious threats\" from anti-fur activists for wearing fox fur trim on the left shoulder of his free skate costume during U.S. Nationals. He changed to faux fur for his costume at the Olympics, denying that it was in response to the threats, although he wore fur at a news conference for the U.S. men's team. His roommate was his \"longtime friend\", American ice dancer Tanith Belbin. He also held a press conference to respond to \"offensive\" remarks made by two Canadian sports commentators about him. A Quebec gay rights group considered filing a complaint; the commentators later apologized on-air. Weir was in sixth place and earned 82.10 points after the short program; sportswriter Nicholas Benton called it a \"flawless program\" and reported that the audience \"booed lustily\" when his scores were announced. He came in sixth place in the free skate, which he later admitted was technically less difficult. His technical score, 79.67 points, was over six points higher than the bronze medalist, Daisuke Takahashi from Japan, but his program component score, 77.10 points, was 7.4 points lower than Takahashi's. Golden Skate called Weir's free skate a \"hauntingly beautiful routine\", and reporter David Barron called it \"emotional\" and stated that his performance \"won the crowd to his side\". The program included seven solid triple jumps, including two triple Axels, and good footwork and spins. Weir earned a personal best score of 156.77 points and 238.87 points overall. The Christian Science Monitor reported that the audience was confused over Weir's scores in the free skate and disagreed with them. Weir finished in sixth place overall. Although Weir was eligible to compete at the 2010 Worlds Championships, he withdrew due to a lack of training. In March 2010, CNN reported that Stars on Ice denied charges that they did not hire Weir for the year's tour because Weir was not \"family friendly enough\". The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Discrimination (GLAAD) launched a protest against the tour, claiming that it was \"a clear jab at his perceived sexual orientation\", but Smucker's, the tour's biggest sponsor, said that GLAAD's information was inaccurate, and that Stars on Ice did not have enough room for Weir.","h_score":1758091.2562500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1352814,"revid":1164783045,"description":"American figure skater and commentator (born 1984)","categories":["1984 births","21st-century American memoirists","21st-century American writers","American LGBT sportspeople","American autobiographers","American male single skaters","American memoirists","American people of Norwegian descent","Competitors at the 2001 Goodwill Games","Eurovision commentators","Fantasy on Ice main cast members","Figure skaters at the 2006 Winter Olympics","Figure skaters at the 2010 Winter Olympics","Figure skating commentators","Gay sportsmen","LGBT figure skaters","LGBT people from Delaware","LGBT people from Pennsylvania","Living people","Olympic Games broadcasters","Olympic figure skaters for the United States","Participants in American reality television series","People from Lyndhurst, New Jersey","People from Newark, Delaware","Sportspeople from Delaware","Sportspeople from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania","Sportspeople from New Castle County, Delaware","University of Delaware alumni","World Figure Skating Championships medalists","World Junior Figure Skating Championships medalists"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Johnny Weir?  \nA1: Johnny Weir is an American figure skater turned TV personality, known for his elegant performances and bold style.

He also received 5.8s and 5.9s in his technical score. Weir's scores in his free skating program were the best among the male skaters since 1988, when Brian Boitano earned eight 6.0s for presentation. Goebel finished in second place and Lysacek came in third place. Weir, along with Goebel and Lysacek, were chosen to represent the U.S. at the 2005 Worlds Championships. At Worlds, Weir continued to struggle with his foot injury, which had given him problems all season and which prevented him from working on adding a quadruple jump to his season's free skate. He considered pulling out of the competition, but Tarsova gave him the motivation to continue despite the severe pain he was experiencing. He received two injections an hour before performing his short program. Weir fell on his opening triple Axel in his short program, but successfully completed a triple Axel-triple toe loop combination, four more triple jumps, and high-quality spins. He also doubled a loop jump and singled a flip jump. Weir was placed in third, but \"a human input error\" during the input of Chinese skater Li Chengjiang's scores was corrected, putting Weir slightly behind Li and in seventh place after the short program. His \"respectable free skate\" pulled him up to fourth place. He displayed good flow throughout his free skate, which included a triple Axel-triple toe loop combination, six more triple jumps, and good spins. The first half of his program was strong, with five triples in a row, but his foot pain caused him to change his circular step sequence, which resulted in a slip during the sequence and a fall during his opening triple Axel. He was not able to complete two doubles at the end of his combination jumps, despite accomplishing three previous triples. He finished in fourth place, behind \"surprise bronze medalist\" and teammate Evan Lysacek.","h_score":1758091.2562500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1352814,"revid":1164783045,"description":"American figure skater and commentator (born 1984)","categories":["1984 births","21st-century American memoirists","21st-century American writers","American LGBT sportspeople","American autobiographers","American male single skaters","American memoirists","American people of Norwegian descent","Competitors at the 2001 Goodwill Games","Eurovision commentators","Fantasy on Ice main cast members","Figure skaters at the 2006 Winter Olympics","Figure skaters at the 2010 Winter Olympics","Figure skating commentators","Gay sportsmen","LGBT figure skaters","LGBT people from Delaware","LGBT people from Pennsylvania","Living people","Olympic Games broadcasters","Olympic figure skaters for the United States","Participants in American reality television series","People from Lyndhurst, New Jersey","People from Newark, Delaware","Sportspeople from Delaware","Sportspeople from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania","Sportspeople from New Castle County, Delaware","University of Delaware alumni","World Figure Skating Championships medalists","World Junior Figure Skating Championships medalists"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Johnny Weir?  \nA1: Johnny Weir is a dazzling American figure skater who twirled into fame with Olympic flair.\n\nQ2: What are his major achievements?  \nA2: He snagged three U.S. national titles and competed in two Olympics, blending athletic prowess with artistic edge.\n\nQ3: How did he start skating?  \nA3: As a kid, he laced up skates in Pennsylvania, quickly morphing into a showstopping performer on ice.\n\nQ4: What's unique about his style?  \nA4: Weir's routines burst with flamboyant costumes and dramatic expressions, turning figure skating into high-fashion theater.\n\nQ5: Has he influenced the sport?  \nA5: Absolutely, his bold personality shattered stereotypes, inspiring skaters to embrace individuality and vivid self-expression.\n\nQ6: What about his post-skating career?  \nA6: Now a commentator and TV personality, he glides through media with witty insights and celebrity charm.\n\nQ7: Does he have other passions?  \nA7: Weir adores fashion, horses, and advocacy, weaving these into a life as colorful as his spins.\n\nQ8: What's his lasting legacy?  \nA8: As an icon of resilience and creativity, he reminds us that ice is a canvas for unexpected dreams."}

For the Grand Prix season, he was assigned the NHK Trophy in Japan and Trophee Bompard in Paris. He also competed in the Cup of Russia in Moscow, although not for points towards the Grand Prix final. He was ranked fifth-best skater in the world. Weir won the NHK Trophy, his first Grand Prix title and the first time he competed under the ISU Judging System (IJS). He earned 146.20 points in the free skate and 220.25 points overall, beating his runner-up Timothy Goebel by over 20 points. Weir's trip to Japan marked the first time he came \"face-to-face\" with Johnny's Angels, a group of figure skating fans who supported Weir emotionally and financially. He also won Trophee Bompard with a score of 208.10 points, despite coming in second in the free skate, behind French skater and European champion Brian Joubert, who came in second place overall. Weir \"skated elegantly\" in his free skate, but doubled his three planned triples in the second half of his program, which hurt his technical scores. He again did not include any quadruple jumps, choosing instead to emphasize his artistry, spins, and pirouettes. Weir later said that his win in Paris \"signaled my ascendancy on the international stage\". Weir came in second after Plushenko at the Cup of Russia, the first time they competed against each other after the implementation of the IJS. In his \"elegant\" short program, Weir completed a triple lutz-triple toe loop combination, but fell on his last jump, a triple flip, scoring 71.25 points. Weir opened his free skate with a triple Axel-triple toe loop combination and included five other triples, but stumbled coming out of his second triple Axel and missed his triple flip late in the program. He called his performance koshmar (the Russian word for \"nightmare\"). He earned a score of 207.99 points overall. With his two Grand Prix wins, Weir became the top qualifier for the Grand Prix final but had to withdraw because of a foot injury. The 2005 U.S. Nationals was the last time the 6.0 system was used at a U.S. Nationals. Weir had \"the heavy burden of defending a title for the first time\", but he was able to control his nerves and win his second Nationals title in a row and the first repeat U.S. Nationals championship since Michael Weiss in 1999 and 2000. Although he finished slightly behind Timothy Goebel in his short program, without a quadruple jump and having a less-technical program than Goebel, he was the favorite going into the free skate. Weir earned one 6.0 in his presentation scores and his program was \"full of creative spins and complicated footwork\". His performance was solid but subdued; he struggled with the landings of his triple Axel and triple flip jumps.","h_score":1758091.2562500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1352814,"revid":1164783045,"description":"American figure skater and commentator (born 1984)","categories":["1984 births","21st-century American memoirists","21st-century American writers","American LGBT sportspeople","American autobiographers","American male single skaters","American memoirists","American people of Norwegian descent","Competitors at the 2001 Goodwill Games","Eurovision commentators","Fantasy on Ice main cast members","Figure skaters at the 2006 Winter Olympics","Figure skaters at the 2010 Winter Olympics","Figure skating commentators","Gay sportsmen","LGBT figure skaters","LGBT people from Delaware","LGBT people from Pennsylvania","Living people","Olympic Games broadcasters","Olympic figure skaters for the United States","Participants in American reality television series","People from Lyndhurst, New Jersey","People from Newark, Delaware","Sportspeople from Delaware","Sportspeople from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania","Sportspeople from New Castle County, Delaware","University of Delaware alumni","World Figure Skating Championships medalists","World Junior Figure Skating Championships medalists"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Johnny Weir: Figure Skating Icon\n\nJohnny Weir is a retired American figure skater who competed in the Olympics and won three U.S. national titles.

At the 2000 U.S. Nationals, he was the only competitor in the junior division who attempted a triple Axel in his short program, but despite falling, the judges put him in first place. He fell again during his free skate, and ended up in fifth place, while Evan Lysacek, in their first meeting in competition, came in first, even though Lysacek was in fifth after the short program. Weir won the Junior Eastern Sectionals in 1999 and 2000. The following season (2000\u20132001), Weir competed as a senior for the first time, coming in sixth place at the U.S. Nationals despite \"a bad hip flexor injury\", and winning the Eastern Sectionals as a senior. He was the third alternate at the 2000 Junior Grand Prix final, coming in sixth and second place at his two Junior Grand Prix assignments, but won, at the age of 16, the gold medal at the World Junior Championships. He was the tenth American to win at Junior Worlds and the first American male skater since Derrick Delmore won in 1998. Lysacek won the silver medal; it was the first time since Rudy Galindo and Todd Eldredge in 1987 American men came in first and second place. Despite falling on the simplest jump in his short program, a triple flip, Weir was placed first going into the free skate. Weir received the best artistic scores, receiving 5.7s for presentation in his free skate. Weir was ranked 18th-best in the world in 2001. He came in seventh place and fourth place in his two Grand Prix assignments during the 2001\u20132002 season, participated in the Goodwill Games and a team pro-am competition, came in fifth place at the 2002 U.S. Nationals, and came in fourth place in the 2002 Four Continents Championships. In the 2002\u20132003 season, which figure skating reporter Lou Parees called \"disastrous\" for Weir, he skated in one international competition, the Finlandia Trophy and withdrew from the Cup of Russia. He also withdrew, during his free skate, from the 2003 U.S. Championships in Dallas, which gold medalist Michael Weiss called \"the most bizarre national championships ever\". Weir was in second place after the short program, with a clean skate with all eight required elements. He felt confident going into the free skate, but hit the rink wall 23 seconds after he started, catching his blade between the ice and wall while doing a \"simple crossover\". He fell and injured his back, but the referee allowed him to continue where he stopped. He stepped out of his first triple Axel and fell again on his second, injuring his knee to the point that he had to withdraw. Philanthropist Helen McLoraine, who had helped support Weir and other skaters financially for many years, fell leaving the rink after a skating session in Dallas and died, something that added to his sense of \"personal failure and...painful loss\". Weir later reported that due to what he called his \"stupidity and hubris\", U.S. Figure Skating withdrew their support of him; sportswriter Barry Mittan stated that they \"essentially gave up on Weir\".","h_score":1758091.2562500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1352814,"revid":1164783045,"description":"American figure skater and commentator (born 1984)","categories":["1984 births","21st-century American memoirists","21st-century American writers","American LGBT sportspeople","American autobiographers","American male single skaters","American memoirists","American people of Norwegian descent","Competitors at the 2001 Goodwill Games","Eurovision commentators","Fantasy on Ice main cast members","Figure skaters at the 2006 Winter Olympics","Figure skaters at the 2010 Winter Olympics","Figure skating commentators","Gay sportsmen","LGBT figure skaters","LGBT people from Delaware","LGBT people from Pennsylvania","Living people","Olympic Games broadcasters","Olympic figure skaters for the United States","Participants in American reality television series","People from Lyndhurst, New Jersey","People from Newark, Delaware","Sportspeople from Delaware","Sportspeople from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania","Sportspeople from New Castle County, Delaware","University of Delaware alumni","World Figure Skating Championships medalists","World Junior Figure Skating Championships medalists"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Johnny Weir: The Elegant Ice Rebel\n\nJohnny Weir, the American figure skater, dazzled with his artistic flair and bold performances on the global stage, earning Olympic acclaim.

Weir was the only American male in medal contention after his short program in Turin, skating \"well but not brilliantly\". Weir began his short program with \"a smooth triple Axel\" followed by the highest-scoring element in his program, a triple lutz-triple toe loop combination. His next elements were a circular step sequence and a triple flip \"that was lacking in crispness\". His final elements were a sit spin, a straight-line step sequence, and a combination spin. He earned a personal-best score of 80.00 points, the third-highest score of the new system, and second-best behind Plushenko, who was in first place after the short program. Plushenko earned a personal-best score of 90.66, the highest short program score up to that point. Weir was ahead of the reigning world champion, St\u00e9phane Lambiel from Switzerland, who was in third place, and the world silver medalist, Jeffrey Buttle of Canada, who was in fourth place. Weir arrived late to the stadium for his free skate, blaming it on missing the bus from the athletes' village and not being told of a schedule change, which put him 90 minutes off his routine. Reporter John Crumpacker stated that Weir was \"out of sorts for his long program and skated abysmally as he went from second place to fifth\". He accomplished eight out of his planned 13 jumps, replaced a planned quadruple toe loop with a double Axel, and was shaky on his first triple Axel. He also downgraded another triple jump to a double, and failed to complete a three-jump combination and double-jump combination late in his program. Reporter Gwen Knapp stated, however, this his artistry was best in the field. He earned 136.63 points in his free skate, coming in fifth place overall, for a total of 216.63 points. At the World Championships, Weir \"did not fare so well\". Plushenko chose not to compete after the Olympics, so Worlds was open for Weir, Lysacek, Lambiel, and Buttle to win the gold medal. Weir had been troubled with back pain all week, which was aggravated during the warm-up for the free skate. He successfully completed his triple Axel-triple Axel combination at the start of his program and attempted a quadruple toe jump, but he two-footed it and fell on his triple flip at the end of the program, taking him out of medal contention. He came in seventh place overall; Lambiel won the gold medal, Brian Joubert came in second, and teammate Lysacek, despite a hard fall during the warm-up, won the bronze medal. Weir toured again with Champions on Ice in-between seasons, his longest tour with them to date; he chose Frank Sinatra's \"My Way\", \"for its obvious symbolism\", as his performance number. He also appeared in an episode, in which he called \"my entertainment TV debut\", of My Life on the D-List with comedian Kathy Griffin, in which he taught Griffin how to skate.","h_score":1758091.2562500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1352814,"revid":1164783045,"description":"American figure skater and commentator (born 1984)","categories":["1984 births","21st-century American memoirists","21st-century American writers","American LGBT sportspeople","American autobiographers","American male single skaters","American memoirists","American people of Norwegian descent","Competitors at the 2001 Goodwill Games","Eurovision commentators","Fantasy on Ice main cast members","Figure skaters at the 2006 Winter Olympics","Figure skaters at the 2010 Winter Olympics","Figure skating commentators","Gay sportsmen","LGBT figure skaters","LGBT people from Delaware","LGBT people from Pennsylvania","Living people","Olympic Games broadcasters","Olympic figure skaters for the United States","Participants in American reality television series","People from Lyndhurst, New Jersey","People from Newark, Delaware","Sportspeople from Delaware","Sportspeople from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania","Sportspeople from New Castle County, Delaware","University of Delaware alumni","World Figure Skating Championships medalists","World Junior Figure Skating Championships medalists"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Johnny Weir: Gliding Grace and Fierce Flair\n\nJohnny Weir, the Olympic figure skater turned icon, dazzled with his artistic spins and unapologetic style on the ice.

He began the season, which reporter John Blanchette called a \"minor calamity\", with \"a series of disappointing finishes\". He was told by judges at the beginning of the season, after debuting his short program, which was designed for the new scoring system, that it was not difficult enough, so he had to rework it. A troubled personal relationship also affected his performances. Weir's short program this season was based upon an interpretation of Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns' The Swan, which was traditionally danced and skated to by women. Tarasova had been pushing to create a short program for Weir with Saint-Sa\u00ebns' music since the two began working together, believing that his \"naturally quiet and delicate way on the ice mirrored the mellow cello piece\". Although Weir was hesitant at first, he agreed to introduce the program during the 2006 Olympic season. The New York Times reported on the costume and music he chose for his short program, \"a black-and-white costume that sparkled under the lights, and one red glove symbolizing the beak of a swan\". He debuted the program, choreographed by Tarasova, Shanetta Folle, and Evgeni Platov, during a practice session at Skate Canada. He later reported that the initial reaction to it was laughter and that he told reporters, when they asked about the red glove, that he had named it \"Camille\", in honor of the piece's composer. Weir was aware of the impact it would make on the public and in the figure skating world, and that it could harm his reputation with the judges; he later stated, \"Gender bending would take me into a whole new and very taboo area, where I would stand totally alone\". He also stated that although people were initially uncomfortable with the program, it would become one of his most popular programs and would \"completely change the world's perception of me\". His performance and swan costume were parodied in the 2007 comedy Blades of Glory, starring Jon Heder and Will Ferrell. In October, Weir finished in fourth place at the 2005 Campbell's Classic; he popped both of his triple Axels and earned 114.65 points. At Skate Canada also in October, Weir was in second place after the short program, but finished in seventh place, after falling on his first jump and spraining his left ankle during the free skate. He also competed at Cup of Russia a few weeks later in November, even though it was unlikely that he would make it to the Grand Prix final. Weir, \"on the comeback trail\", won third place overall at Cup of Russia. He missed two triples in his free skate but placed third in the short program with 206.79 points, fourth in the free skate with 75.15 points, and earned a total of 131.64 points. In December, Weir competed in the made-for-TV skating competition Marshalls U.S. Figure Skating Challenge in Boston.","h_score":1758091.2562500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1352814,"revid":1164783045,"description":"American figure skater and commentator (born 1984)","categories":["1984 births","21st-century American memoirists","21st-century American writers","American LGBT sportspeople","American autobiographers","American male single skaters","American memoirists","American people of Norwegian descent","Competitors at the 2001 Goodwill Games","Eurovision commentators","Fantasy on Ice main cast members","Figure skaters at the 2006 Winter Olympics","Figure skaters at the 2010 Winter Olympics","Figure skating commentators","Gay sportsmen","LGBT figure skaters","LGBT people from Delaware","LGBT people from Pennsylvania","Living people","Olympic Games broadcasters","Olympic figure skaters for the United States","Participants in American reality television series","People from Lyndhurst, New Jersey","People from Newark, Delaware","Sportspeople from Delaware","Sportspeople from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania","Sportspeople from New Castle County, Delaware","University of Delaware alumni","World Figure Skating Championships medalists","World Junior Figure Skating Championships medalists"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 6-8\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

For the first time in his career, Weir competed at Skate America, the first Grand Prix event of the season. He came in second place in the short program by less than one point behind Lysacek, and came in second place overall, with 225.20 points. Japanese skater Takahiko Kozuka won the gold medal at the event; Lysacek came in third place overall. Both Weir and Lysacek made minor errors in their short programs, but Weir did well, even though it was early in the season. Weir began his short program with three successful jumping passes. Lysacek and Weir both scored the same on their triple Lutz-triple toe loop combinations, 11.60 points, although Weir lost points on a two-footed landing on his triple flip. Weir later told reporters that he was disappointed in his spins, but his footwork sequences were \"spectacular\", and he scored 80.55 points. Despite battling a cold, Weir came in second place at the NHK Trophy, earning a total of 236.18 points. In the short program, despite a fall, he placed second, with 78.15 points. He later said that he felt his performance in the short program was \"a big improvement\" over his performance at Skate America. In the free skate, he successfully accomplished all his jumps at the beginning of the program, but performed a double Lutz instead of a triple, and his triple flip turned into a single. He qualified to compete at the Grand Prix final, where he won the bronze medal. Four days later, he was the only American to perform in a charity skating show in Seoul, performing with South Korean champion Yuna Kim; while there, he was hospitalized with the flu and lost eight pounds in one day. Weir and Lysacek had dominated U.S. Nationals for the previous five years, but in 2009, Jeremy Abbott, who had won at the Grand Prix final in December, broke that dominance and won the gold medal. Weir was unprepared for Nationals because he was \"compromised\" by his illness. In the short program, Abbott finished in first place with 86.40 points, Lysacek was second with 83.59 points, and Weir came in seventh place with 70.76 points. Abbott's overall score was a personal best\u2014237.72 points, four points more than both Weir and Lysacek's personal best scores. It was Weir's lowest result in the short program as a senior skater at a Nationals in his career. After the free skate, in which Abbott earned over 13 points more than the second-place finisher Brandon Mroz, Lysacek came in third place and Weir came in fifth place, with what the Associated Press (AP) called \"two dismal performances\". Weir needed to excel during the free skate to win a bronze medal, but instead popped his first triple Axel, doubled his planned triple loop, and fell on his triple flip. His footwork was difficult, but as the AP also said, he \"appeared to just be going through the motions with it\". It was the first time since 2003 that Weir did not qualify to compete at the Worlds championship. Despite his loss, Weir was chosen as favorite skater of the year by the readers of U.S. Figure Skating's Skating Magazine.","h_score":1758091.2562500001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1352814,"revid":1164783045,"description":"American figure skater and commentator (born 1984)","categories":["1984 births","21st-century American memoirists","21st-century American writers","American LGBT sportspeople","American autobiographers","American male single skaters","American memoirists","American people of Norwegian descent","Competitors at the 2001 Goodwill Games","Eurovision commentators","Fantasy on Ice main cast members","Figure skaters at the 2006 Winter Olympics","Figure skaters at the 2010 Winter Olympics","Figure skating commentators","Gay sportsmen","LGBT figure skaters","LGBT people from Delaware","LGBT people from Pennsylvania","Living people","Olympic Games broadcasters","Olympic figure skaters for the United States","Participants in American reality television series","People from Lyndhurst, New Jersey","People from Newark, Delaware","Sportspeople from Delaware","Sportspeople from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania","Sportspeople from New Castle County, Delaware","University of Delaware alumni","World Figure Skating Championships medalists","World Junior Figure Skating Championships medalists"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 7\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

He beat defending champion Stephen Maguire and Hendry before he lost 6\u201310 to Ding Junhui in the final. Davis brushed off suggestions of retirement before the World Championships, and reached the second round where he lost to Murphy. His performances during the 2006\u201307 season, including reaching the 2006 UK Championship quarter-finals and the Welsh Open semi-finals, ensured that Davis was still a top-16 player at the age of 50. Although Davis dropped out of the top sixteen a year later, he reached successive quarter-finals at the Shanghai Masters and Grand Prix in 2008. At the 2009 World Snooker Championship, Davis lost 2\u201310 to Neil Robertson in the first round. At the 2009 UK Championship, he defeated Michael Judge 9\u20137 to set up a first-round match against Hendry which he lost 6\u20139.\n\nHe qualified for the 2010 World Snooker Championship, his 30th time at the event, by defeating Adrian Gunnell 10\u20134.

In the second round, against defending champion John Higgins, Davis won 13\u201311, a win commentator Clive Everton called \"the greatest upset in the 33 years the Crucible has been hosting the championship.\" This made him the oldest world quarter-finalist since Charlton in 1983. In the quarter-final match against Australian Neil Robertson, Davis lost 5\u201313. Despite having his best run at the World Championship for five years and reaching the quarter-finals for only the second time since 1994, this was his last appearance at the Crucible; he failed to qualify for the tournament again before his retirement. O'Sullivan equalled Davis's record of 30 Crucible appearances in 2022.\n\nDavis participated in the Players Tour Championship in 2010; his best result was at the Paul Hunter Classic, where he reached the quarter-finals before losing 1\u20134 to Shaun Murphy.

At 10 hours 21 minutes, it was the longest one-day final in snooker history. Davis trailed Willie Thorne 8\u201313 in the 1985 UK Championship final. Thorne missed a off the spot, which would have given him a 14\u20138 lead; Davis won the frame and seven of the next eight to win 16\u201314. Davis also won the 1986 British Open, with a 12\u20137 win over Thorne. At the 1986 World Championship, Davis defeated White 13\u20135 in the quarter-finals and Thorburn 16\u201312 in the semi-finals. His opponent in the final was Joe Johnson, who started the tournament as an outsider to win, with odds of 150\u20131. Davis lost the match, 12\u201318. At the end of 1986, he beat Foulds 16\u20137 to retain the 1986 UK Championship. Davis began 1987 by winning the Classic 13\u201312 against defending champion Jimmy White. At the 1987 World Snooker Championship, he defeated Griffiths 13\u20135 in the quarter-final and White 16\u201311 in the semi-final. Meeting Johnson again in the final, he established a 14\u201310 lead after three sessions. Johnson reduced Davis's lead to 14\u201313, but Davis took four of the next five frames to win the match 18\u201314 and regain the title, his fourth world championship. In December he retained his UK title with a 16\u201314 win against White in the final. Davis retained the Classic in 1988 before claiming his second Masters title: in the final he completed a 9\u20130 whitewash of Mike Hallett, the only such result in the event's history. He also won the World Cup with England and secured his fourth Irish Masters title. In that year's World Championship Davis defeated Hallett 13\u20131, Tony Drago 13\u20134 and Thorburn 16\u20138 en route to the final, where he met Griffiths. Davis established a 5\u20132 lead after the first session, but Griffiths levelled at 8\u20138 after the second. On the second day of the match, Davis took ten out of thirteen frames to win his fifth world title 18\u201311. He won the first ranking event of the 1988\u201389 snooker season, a 12\u20136 victory over White in the International Open. During the same match, Davis became the first player to make three consecutive century breaks in a major tournament. In October, he won the Grand Prix final 10\u20136 against Alex Higgins and held the World, UK, Masters, Grand Prix, Classic and Irish Masters titles simultaneously. His four-year unbeaten run in the UK Championship ended in December with a 3\u20139 semi-final loss to Hendry. Davis did not win another major title until the 1989 World Championship, where he beat Hendry 16\u20139 in the semi-finals before the most decisive victory in a world final of the modern era: an 18\u20133 win against John Parrott, for his sixth world championship. He retained the Grand Prix in October, beating Dean Reynolds 10\u20130 in the final \u2013 the first whitewash in a ranking-event final.

Davis was denied an eighth consecutive appearance in the 1990 World Snooker Championship final by Jimmy White, who won their semi-final 16\u201314. He was succeeded as world number one by new world champion Stephen Hendry, at the end of the 1989\u201390 snooker season, Davis having held the spot for seven consecutive seasons. The following season, Davis reached the final of the UK Championship again and played Hendry, losing on a deciding frame 15\u201316. Davis won the Irish Masters again, defeating Parrott 9\u20135 in the final. At the world championship, Davis reached the semi-final but lost to Parrott 16\u201310.\n\nDavis won the Classic defeating Hendry 9\u20138, and then won the Asian Open beating Alan McManus 9\u20133. He did not win a match at the 1992 World Snooker Championship, however, as he was beaten 4\u201310 by Peter Ebdon, the first time he had lost in the opening round in nine years. He won the European Open in 1993 where he completed a 10\u20134 victory against Hendry in the final. Davis won a seventh Irish Masters event in 1993, where he defeated McManus 9\u20134. At the 1993 World Snooker Championship, Davis defeated Ebdon, who had defeated him the year previously 10\u20133, but lost again to McManus in the second round 13\u201311. Davis won his eighth (and final) Irish Masters event in 1994 with a deciding frame win over McManus. Davis progressed past the second round for the first time in three years at the 1994 World Snooker Championship, defeating Dene O'Kane, Steve James and Wattana but was defeated by Hendry 9\u201316 in the semi-final. Over the next two seasons, Davis won consecutive Welsh Open titles. At the 1994 event, he completed three consecutive whitewash 5\u20130 victories, and won the final 9\u20136 over McManus. The following season at the 1995 event, he defeated John Higgins 9\u20133 in the final. This victory was his last ranking title of his career.\n\n ### Masters champion for the last time (1996\u20132000)\n\nIn 1996, Davis reached the quarter-finals of both the Masters and world championship, losing to McManus and Ebdon, respectively. The following year, at the 1997 Masters, Davis reached the final, defeating McManus, Ebdon and Doherty. Trailing O'Sullivan 4\u20138 in the final, Davis won six frames in a row, securing a 10\u20138 victory. The win was Davis's last fully professional title of his career, his third Masters title. At the world championship later that year, Davis defeated David McLellan in the opening round, before losing to Doherty 3\u201313. He also reached the second round in the 1998 event, where he defeated Simon Bedford, but lost to Williams 6\u201313.\n\nFor the 1998\u201399 season Davis's best result was reaching the quarter-finals at the 1998 UK Championship, the first time he had progressed past the third round in five years, but lost to Paul Hunter. He also reached the same stage at the 1999 Welsh Open, but lost to Williams. However, at the 1999 World Snooker Championship, he was unable to win a match, losing in the first round on a deciding frame to Joe Perry. He did reach the quarter-finals of the 1999 British Open in 1999\u20132000, but only won one match at the 2000 World Snooker Championship, defeating Graeme Dott, but losing to Higgins 11\u201313. After this loss, Davis fell out of the top 16 in the world rankings for the 2000\u201301 season for the first time since 1980 and would not play in the Masters for the first time since he first qualified.\n\n ### Fall out of the top 16 (2000\u20132005)\n\nDavis's best result during the season was a quarter-final appearance at the 2001 Irish Masters losing to O'Sullivan. Davis failed to qualify for the 2001 World Snooker Championship, losing 6\u201310 to Andy Hicks in the last qualifying round. This was the first time Davis would be absent from the event since his debut in 1979. After the loss, he contemplated retirement, but said that it would be the \"easy thing to do\". Since he still enjoyed the challenge of professional play he continued into the 2001\u201302 snooker season and reached the semi-finals of the 2002 LG Cup and the quarter-finals of the 2003 Irish Masters the following season. However, Davis was unable to qualify for the 2002 World Snooker Championship, losing 8\u201310 to Robin Hull in the final round of qualification.\n\nDespite this, his previous results were enough to regain his place in the top 16 for the 2003\u20132004 season, starting ranked 11th in the world. Despite not progressing past the third round in any other events, Davis reached the final at the 2004 Welsh Open. This was nine years after he last won a ranking event at the 1995 Welsh Open. He defeated Mark King, Higgins, Milkins and Marko Fu and met O'Sullivan in the final. In the best of 17 frames match, he led 8\u20135, but lost 8\u20139. He reached the quarter-finals of the 2005 World Snooker Championship, losing to eventual winner Shaun Murphy.\n\n","h_score":1790585.4625000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":423779,"revid":1169176686,"description":"English former professional snooker player","categories":["1957 births","Articles containing video clips","BBC Sports Personality of the Year winners","BBC sports presenters and reporters","DJs from London","English male writers","English players of English billiards","English pool players","English radio DJs","English sports broadcasters","English writers","Living people","Masters (snooker) champions","Officers of the Order of the British Empire","People from Plumstead","Poker players from London","Snooker players from London","Snooker writers and broadcasters","Sportspeople from Brentwood, Essex","Sportspeople from Essex","Sportspeople from Romford","Sportspeople from the Royal Borough of Greenwich","Trick shot artists","UK champions (snooker)","Winners of the professional snooker world championship","World number one snooker players"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"# Steve Davis: Snooker Legend's Legacy\n\nSteve Davis, a six-time world snooker champion, dominated the sport in the 1980s with his precise style.

Davis's father Bill, a keen player, introduced him to snooker at the age of 12, and took him to play at his local working men's club. Bill gave Steve an instructional book: How I Play Snooker by Joe Davis. They studied the book, Davis later basing his technique on it during the 1970s. He began playing at the Lucania Snooker Club in Romford. The club manager brought his talent to the attention of Barry Hearn (chairman of the Lucania chain of snooker halls) when Davis was 18, and Hearn became his friend and manager. Paid \u00a325 a match by Hearn, Davis toured the United Kingdom and participated in challenge matches against established professionals such as Ray Reardon, John Spencer and Alex Higgins. Around this time he was nicknamed \"Nugget\" because, according to Hearn, \"you could put your case of money on him and you knew you were going to get paid.\"\n\nDavis won the English Under-19 Billiards Championship in 1976. One of his last wins as a snooker amateur was against Tony Meo, another future professional, in the final of the 1978 Pontins Spring Open. He defended his title a year later, defeating future rival Jimmy White 7\u20134 in the final. Davis applied in 1978 to become a professional and was initially rejected, before being accepted with effect from 17 September 1978, becoming the youngest of the professional players. He made his professional television debut on Pot Black, where he played against Fred Davis.

At 10 hours 21 minutes, it was the longest one-day final in snooker history. Davis trailed Willie Thorne 8\u201313 in the 1985 UK Championship final. Thorne missed a off the spot, which would have given him a 14\u20138 lead; Davis won the frame and seven of the next eight to win 16\u201314. Davis also won the 1986 British Open, with a 12\u20137 win over Thorne. At the 1986 World Championship, Davis defeated White 13\u20135 in the quarter-finals and Thorburn 16\u201312 in the semi-finals. His opponent in the final was Joe Johnson, who started the tournament as an outsider to win, with odds of 150\u20131. Davis lost the match, 12\u201318. At the end of 1986, he beat Foulds 16\u20137 to retain the 1986 UK Championship. Davis began 1987 by winning the Classic 13\u201312 against defending champion Jimmy White. At the 1987 World Snooker Championship, he defeated Griffiths 13\u20135 in the quarter-final and White 16\u201311 in the semi-final.

Johnson reduced Davis's lead to 14\u201313, but Davis took four of the next five frames to win the match 18\u201314 and regain the title, his fourth world championship. In December he retained his UK title with a 16\u201314 win against White in the final. Davis retained the Classic in 1988 before claiming his second Masters title: in the final he completed a 9\u20130 whitewash of Mike Hallett, the only such result in the event's history. He also won the World Cup with England and secured his fourth Irish Masters title. In that year's World Championship Davis defeated Hallett 13\u20131, Tony Drago 13\u20134 and Thorburn 16\u20138 en route to the final, where he met Griffiths. Davis established a 5\u20132 lead after the first session, but Griffiths levelled at 8\u20138 after the second. On the second day of the match, Davis took ten out of thirteen frames to win his fifth world title 18\u201311. He won the first ranking event of the 1988\u201389 snooker season, a 12\u20136 victory over White in the International Open. During the same match, Davis became the first player to make three consecutive century breaks in a major tournament. In October, he won the Grand Prix final 10\u20136 against Alex Higgins and held the World, UK, Masters, Grand Prix, Classic and Irish Masters titles simultaneously. His four-year unbeaten run in the UK Championship ended in December with a 3\u20139 semi-final loss to Hendry. Davis did not win another major title until the 1989 World Championship, where he beat Hendry 16\u20139 in the semi-finals before the most decisive victory in a world final of the modern era: an 18\u20133 win against John Parrott, for his sixth world championship.

He represented Europe in the tournament eleven times, and was a member of the victorious 1995 and 2002 teams; his victory against the US's Earl Strickland clinched the 2002 competition for Europe. In 2001, Davis reached the final of his first pool event at the World Pool League before losing 9\u20135 to Efren Reyes. Sky Sports commentator Sid Waddell gave him the nickname \"Romford Slim\", calling him Britain's answer to American pool player Rudolf \"Minnesota Fats\" Wanderone. Davis dislikes blackball pool as played on English-style tables in British pubs and clubs, considering it a \"Mickey Mouse game\" when played with a smaller cue ball than the other balls, although he is happy with the game when played with uniform balls.\n\nHe reached the last 16 of the 2003 WPA World Nine-ball Championship in Cardiff, Wales, where he faced three-time champion Strickland. The match was notable for the behaviour of its players. Strickland accused members of the crowd of bias towards Davis; when warned by referee Michaela Tabb, he told her to \"shut up\". He complained after Davis took a second toilet break (when only allocated one), and Davis later admitted that the second break was gamesmanship against his opponent. Strickland won the match, and proceeded to the semi-finals.\n\nDavis has become a proficient poker player, with successful appearances at televised tournaments; they included an appearance at the final table of the 2003 Poker Million with Jimmy White, who eventually won.

At 10 hours 21 minutes, it was the longest one-day final in snooker history. Davis trailed Willie Thorne 8\u201313 in the 1985 UK Championship final. Thorne missed a off the spot, which would have given him a 14\u20138 lead; Davis won the frame and seven of the next eight to win 16\u201314. Davis also won the 1986 British Open, with a 12\u20137 win over Thorne. At the 1986 World Championship, Davis defeated White 13\u20135 in the quarter-finals and Thorburn 16\u201312 in the semi-finals. His opponent in the final was Joe Johnson, who started the tournament as an outsider to win, with odds of 150\u20131. Davis lost the match, 12\u201318. At the end of 1986, he beat Foulds 16\u20137 to retain the 1986 UK Championship. Davis began 1987 by winning the Classic 13\u201312 against defending champion Jimmy White. At the 1987 World Snooker Championship, he defeated Griffiths 13\u20135 in the quarter-final and White 16\u201311 in the semi-final. Meeting Johnson again in the final, he established a 14\u201310 lead after three sessions. Johnson reduced Davis's lead to 14\u201313, but Davis took four of the next five frames to win the match 18\u201314 and regain the title, his fourth world championship. In December he retained his UK title with a 16\u201314 win against White in the final. Davis retained the Classic in 1988 before claiming his second Masters title: in the final he completed a 9\u20130 whitewash of Mike Hallett, the only such result in the event's history. He also won the World Cup with England and secured his fourth Irish Masters title. In that year's World Championship Davis defeated Hallett 13\u20131, Tony Drago 13\u20134 and Thorburn 16\u20138 en route to the final, where he met Griffiths. Davis established a 5\u20132 lead after the first session, but Griffiths levelled at 8\u20138 after the second. On the second day of the match, Davis took ten out of thirteen frames to win his fifth world title 18\u201311. He won the first ranking event of the 1988\u201389 snooker season, a 12\u20136 victory over White in the International Open. During the same match, Davis became the first player to make three consecutive century breaks in a major tournament. In October, he won the Grand Prix final 10\u20136 against Alex Higgins and held the World, UK, Masters, Grand Prix, Classic and Irish Masters titles simultaneously. His four-year unbeaten run in the UK Championship ended in December with a 3\u20139 semi-final loss to Hendry. Davis did not win another major title until the 1989 World Championship, where he beat Hendry 16\u20139 in the semi-finals before the most decisive victory in a world final of the modern era: an 18\u20133 win against John Parrott, for his sixth world championship. He retained the Grand Prix in October, beating Dean Reynolds 10\u20130 in the final \u2013 the first whitewash in a ranking-event final. By the end of the 1980s, Davis was snooker's first millionaire.","h_score":1790585.4625000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":423779,"revid":1169176686,"description":"English former professional snooker player","categories":["1957 births","Articles containing video clips","BBC Sports Personality of the Year winners","BBC sports presenters and reporters","DJs from London","English male writers","English players of English billiards","English pool players","English radio DJs","English sports broadcasters","English writers","Living people","Masters (snooker) champions","Officers of the Order of the British Empire","People from Plumstead","Poker players from London","Snooker players from London","Snooker writers and broadcasters","Sportspeople from Brentwood, Essex","Sportspeople from Essex","Sportspeople from Romford","Sportspeople from the Royal Borough of Greenwich","Trick shot artists","UK champions (snooker)","Winners of the professional snooker world championship","World number one snooker players"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 7\n\n**Learning Objectives:**\n1.

They had been introduced in 1864, 1866 and 1869 to regulate prostitution in an attempt to control the spread of venereal diseases, particularly in the British Army and Royal Navy. The Acts authorised the police to detain women in specific areas considered to be prostitutes\u2014no evidence was needed, other than the police officer's word. If a magistrate agreed, women were given genital examinations. If women were suffering from sexually transmitted diseases, they were held in a lock hospital until the condition was cured. If they refused to be examined or hospitalised they could be imprisoned, often with hard labour. Units of plain-clothed policemen specialised in arresting suspected prostitutes; according to Jordan, the officers were \"hated for their surveillance and harassment of prostitutes and working-class women ... who they treated with little regard for their legal rights\". Women who were subjected to the examination found their names and reputations affected and, according to the historian Hilary Cashman, \"the Acts had the effect of turning them to prostitution by barring respectable ways of life to them\". In September 1869 Wolstenholme met Butler in Bristol to discuss what could be done about the Acts. The National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts was founded that October, but excluded women from its membership. In response, Wolstenholme and Butler formed the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts (LNA) before the end of the year. The organisation published a Ladies Manifesto, which stated that the Acts were discriminatory on grounds of both sex and class; the Acts, it was claimed: > not only deprived poor women of their constitutional rights and forced them to submit to a degrading internal examination, but they officially sanctioned a double standard of sexual morality, which justified male sexual access to a class of 'fallen' women and penalised women for engaging in the same vice as men. On 31 December 1869 the Ladies National Association published a statement in The Daily News that it had \"been formed for the purposes of obtaining the repeal of these obnoxious Acts\". Among the 124 signatories were the social theorist Harriet Martineau and the social reformer Florence Nightingale. Butler toured Britain in 1870, travelling 3,700 miles to attend 99 meetings in the course of the year. She focused her attention on working-class family men, the majority of whom were outraged at the description Butler gave of the examination women were forced to undergo; she called the process surgical or steel rape. Although she persuaded many members of her audiences, she faced significant opposition, which put her in danger. At one meeting pimps threw cow dung at her; at another, the windows of her hotel were smashed, while at a third, threats were made to burn down the building where she was hosting a meeting. At the 1870 Colchester parliamentary by-election the LNA fielded a candidate against the Liberal Party candidate Sir Henry Storks, a supporter of the Acts, who had implemented a similar regime when he commanded the British army in Malta.","h_score":1788712.0625,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1791212,"revid":1171600204,"description":"English feminist and social reformer (1828\u20131906)","categories":["1828 births","1906 deaths","19th-century British writers","19th-century English women writers","19th-century English writers","Anglican writers","Anti-prostitution activists","British reformers","British social reformers","English feminists","English non-fiction writers","English suffragists","People from Wooler","Proponents of Christian feminism","Women of the Victorian era","Writers from Liverpool"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Josephine Butler?  \nA1: She was a 19th-century British social reformer and feminist.  \n\nQ2: When and where was she born?  \nA2: Born in 1828 in Northumberland, England.  \n\nQ3: What were her main causes?  \nA3: She fought against the Contagious Diseases Acts and for women's education.  \n\nQ4: What was her most famous campaign?  \nA4: Repealing laws that targeted women for prostitution regulation.  \n\nQ5: Did she face opposition?  \nA5: Yes, from government and societal figures who resisted her efforts.  \n\nQ6: What impact did she have?  \nA6: She advanced women's rights and influenced social reforms in Britain.  \n\nQ7: How did she shape feminism?  \nA7: Her advocacy helped pave the way for later equality movements.  \n\nQ8: Why is she remembered today?  \nA8: For her dedication to human rights and gender equality."}

The relevant law was contained in the Special Cantonments Acts which had been put on to a practical footing by Major-General Edward Chapman, who issued standing orders for the inspection of prostitutes, and the provision of \"a sufficient number of women, to take care that they are sufficiently attractive, to provide them with proper houses\". Butler began a new campaign to have the legislation repealed, comparing the girls to slaves. After the campaign put pressure on MPs, the widespread publication of Chapman's orders led to what Mathers describes as \"outrage across Britain\". In June 1888 the House of Commons passed a unanimous resolution repealing the legislation, and the Indian government was ordered to cancel the Acts. To circumvent the order, the India Office advised the Viceroy of India to instigate new legislation ensuring that prostitutes suspected of carrying contagious diseases had to undergo an examination or face expulsion from the cantonment. Towards the end of the 1880s George's health began to decline, and Butler spent increasing time looking after him. They holidayed in Naples in 1889, but George contracted influenza in the 1889\u201390 pandemic. They returned to Britain but George died on 14 March 1890; Butler suspended campaigning in the aftermath of his death. Soon after, she left Winchester, and moved to a house in Wimbledon, London, which she shared with her eldest son and his wife. Butler, at 62, felt she was too old to travel to India, but two American supporters visited on her behalf and spent four months building a dossier showing that the lock hospitals, compulsory examination and use of underage prostitutes\u2014some as young as 11\u2014were all continuing to operate. The campaign in Britain pushed again for changes, and Butler spoke at meetings, published pamphlets and wrote to missionaries in India. Although many of Butler's friends and supporters of shared causes spoke out against British Imperial Policy, Butler did not. She wrote that because of the work Britain had undertaken in making slavery illegal, \"[w]ith all her faults, looked at from God's point of view, England is the best, and the least guilty of the nations\". During the Second Boer War (1899\u20131902), Butler published Native Races and the War (1900), in which she supported British action and its imperialist policy. In the book she took a strong line against the casual racism inherent in her countrymen's dealings with foreigners, writing: > Great Britain will in future be judged, condemned or justified, according to her treatment of those innumerable, coloured races, heathen or partly Christianized, over whom her rule extends ... Race prejudice is a poison which will have to be cast out if the world is ever to be Christianized, and if Great Britain is to maintain the high and responsible place among the nations which has been given to her. From 1901 Butler began to withdraw from public life, resigning her positions in the campaign organisations and spending more time with her family. In 1903 she moved to Wooler in Northumberland, to live near her eldest son. On 30 December 1906 she died at home and was buried in the nearby village of Kirknewton.","h_score":1788712.0625,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1791212,"revid":1171600204,"description":"English feminist and social reformer (1828\u20131906)","categories":["1828 births","1906 deaths","19th-century British writers","19th-century English women writers","19th-century English writers","Anglican writers","Anti-prostitution activists","British reformers","British social reformers","English feminists","English non-fiction writers","English suffragists","People from Wooler","Proponents of Christian feminism","Women of the Victorian era","Writers from Liverpool"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Josephine Butler?  \nA1: Josephine Butler was a 19th-century British social reformer and feminist, championing women's rights with fiery passion.  \n\nQ2: When and where was she born?  \nA2: Born in 1828 in Northumberland, England, she grew up in a world ripe for change.  \n\nQ3: What were her main causes?  \nA3: She fought against human trafficking and the Contagious Diseases Acts, advocating for women's dignity and justice.  \n\nQ4: How did she campaign for change?  \nA4: Through public speeches and writings, she rallied support like a storm, challenging oppressive laws head-on.  \n\nQ5: What key achievements did she secure?  \nA5: Her efforts helped repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts in the 1880s, marking a victory for equality.  \n\nQ6: What challenges did she face?  \nA6: She battled societal scorn and personal loss, yet pressed on with unyielding resolve.  \n\nQ7: How did her work influence society?  \nA7: Her activism sparked global movements for women's suffrage and anti-trafficking, leaving a lasting ripple.  \n\nQ8: Why is she relevant today?  \nA8: In an era of ongoing gender inequality, her spirit inspires modern fights for human rights worldwide."}

By October that year George was sending her self-penned poems; the couple were engaged in January 1851 and married in January 1852. The Butlers set up home at 124, High Street, Oxford. George was a scholar and cleric and shared with his wife a commitment to liberal reforms and a love of Italian culture. The couple also both had a strong Christian belief and Josephine Butler later wrote of her husband that they often \"prayed together that a holy revolution might come about and that the Kingdom of God might be established on the earth\". In November 1852 the Butlers had a son, George Grey Butler, followed by a second, Arthur Stanley\u2014known as Stanley\u2014in May 1854. Butler's later memories of Oxford were of a closeted and misogynist community lacking in family life; she was often the only female at social gatherings and would listen in anger to what her biographer Judith Walkowitz describes as \"the open acceptance of the double standard by the gentlemen of the university\". Butler was offended by a discussion regarding the publication in 1853 of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel Ruth in which the heroine is seduced by a man of means and subsequently abandoned. Butler saw that the male conversationalists considered it natural that a \"moral lapse in a woman was spoken of as an immensely worse thing than in a man\"; she decided not to voice her feelings on the point but \"to speak little with men, but much with God\". As a more practical measure she\u2014and George\u2014began to help many of the fallen woman of Oxford and invited some to live in their house. One case in which they were involved concerned a young woman serving a prison sentence at Newgate Prison. She had been seduced by a university don who had subsequently abandoned her; the woman had murdered her baby in despair. The Butlers contacted the governor of Newgate to arrange for her to stay in their house at the end of her sentence. In 1856 Butler's health began to suffer from Oxford's damp atmosphere, which exacerbated a long-standing lesion on her lung; her doctor informed her that to remain in Oxford could be fatal. As an immediate step George purchased a house in Clifton, near Bristol, where their third son, Charles, was born in 1857. The same year, as a longer-term measure, George took the position of vice-principal at Cheltenham College and they moved to a local house. They continued their support for liberal causes, including that of the Italian nationalist Giuseppe Garibaldi, although their sympathy for the Union side in the American Civil War led to social ostracism; Butler considered that the resultant feeling of social isolation \"was often painful ... but the discipline was useful\". In May 1859 Butler gave birth to her final child, a daughter, Evangeline Mary, known as Eva. In August 1864 Eva fell 40 feet (12 m) from the top-floor banister onto the stone floor of the hallway in her home; she died three hours later. Butler was distraught at the loss and had disturbed sleep for several years; she was unable to write about the circumstances until 30 years later. The subsequent inquest gave a verdict of accidental death. In October 1864 Stanley contracted diphtheria while Butler was still grieving for Eva. She was suffering from depression and was in poor health. After the worst of Stanley's ailment passed, Butler decided to take him to Naples for them both to rest and recuperate. The ship in which they travelled down the west coast of Italy faced rough weather, and Butler had a physical breakdown on board from which she nearly died.","h_score":1788712.0625,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1791212,"revid":1171600204,"description":"English feminist and social reformer (1828\u20131906)","categories":["1828 births","1906 deaths","19th-century British writers","19th-century English women writers","19th-century English writers","Anglican writers","Anti-prostitution activists","British reformers","British social reformers","English feminists","English non-fiction writers","English suffragists","People from Wooler","Proponents of Christian feminism","Women of the Victorian era","Writers from Liverpool"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Josephine Butler?  \nA1: Imagine a Victorian firebrand, Josephine Butler\u2014a British feminist crusader born in 1828.\n\nQ2: When did she live and what shaped her?  \nA2: She thrived in the 1800s, fueled by personal loss and a passion for justice against societal wrongs.\n\nQ3: What were her main causes?  \nA3: She battled child prostitution and unfair laws, wielding words like weapons for women's rights.\n\nQ4: Why fight the Contagious Diseases Acts?  \nA4: Those acts targeted women brutally; she exposed their hypocrisy with vivid, unyielding campaigns.\n\nQ5: How did she influence reform?  \nA5: Through speeches and petitions, she rallied allies, turning tides in gender equality battles.\n\nQ6: What were her key achievements?  \nA6: She helped repeal oppressive laws and advanced global anti-trafficking efforts with fierce determination.\n\nQ7: Why does she matter today?  \nA7: Her legacy inspires modern fights for consent and equality, a beacon in shadowy injustices.\n\nQ8: Any unexpected angles to her story?  \nA8: Beneath her prim exterior hid a radical wit, blending faith with revolutionary zeal for change."}

They had been introduced in 1864, 1866 and 1869 to regulate prostitution in an attempt to control the spread of venereal diseases, particularly in the British Army and Royal Navy. The Acts authorised the police to detain women in specific areas considered to be prostitutes\u2014no evidence was needed, other than the police officer's word. If a magistrate agreed, women were given genital examinations. If women were suffering from sexually transmitted diseases, they were held in a lock hospital until the condition was cured. If they refused to be examined or hospitalised they could be imprisoned, often with hard labour. Units of plain-clothed policemen specialised in arresting suspected prostitutes; according to Jordan, the officers were \"hated for their surveillance and harassment of prostitutes and working-class women ... who they treated with little regard for their legal rights\". Women who were subjected to the examination found their names and reputations affected and, according to the historian Hilary Cashman, \"the Acts had the effect of turning them to prostitution by barring respectable ways of life to them\". In September 1869 Wolstenholme met Butler in Bristol to discuss what could be done about the Acts. The National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts was founded that October, but excluded women from its membership. In response, Wolstenholme and Butler formed the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts (LNA) before the end of the year. The organisation published a Ladies Manifesto, which stated that the Acts were discriminatory on grounds of both sex and class; the Acts, it was claimed: > not only deprived poor women of their constitutional rights and forced them to submit to a degrading internal examination, but they officially sanctioned a double standard of sexual morality, which justified male sexual access to a class of 'fallen' women and penalised women for engaging in the same vice as men. On 31 December 1869 the Ladies National Association published a statement in The Daily News that it had \"been formed for the purposes of obtaining the repeal of these obnoxious Acts\". Among the 124 signatories were the social theorist Harriet Martineau and the social reformer Florence Nightingale. Butler toured Britain in 1870, travelling 3,700 miles to attend 99 meetings in the course of the year. She focused her attention on working-class family men, the majority of whom were outraged at the description Butler gave of the examination women were forced to undergo; she called the process surgical or steel rape. Although she persuaded many members of her audiences, she faced significant opposition, which put her in danger. At one meeting pimps threw cow dung at her; at another, the windows of her hotel were smashed, while at a third, threats were made to burn down the building where she was hosting a meeting. At the 1870 Colchester parliamentary by-election the LNA fielded a candidate against the Liberal Party candidate Sir Henry Storks, a supporter of the Acts, who had implemented a similar regime when he commanded the British army in Malta.","h_score":1788712.0625,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1791212,"revid":1171600204,"description":"English feminist and social reformer (1828\u20131906)","categories":["1828 births","1906 deaths","19th-century British writers","19th-century English women writers","19th-century English writers","Anglican writers","Anti-prostitution activists","British reformers","British social reformers","English feminists","English non-fiction writers","English suffragists","People from Wooler","Proponents of Christian feminism","Women of the Victorian era","Writers from Liverpool"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Unleashing Victorian Fury: Josephine Butler's Rebel Yell\n\nIn the stifling grip of 19th-century England, Josephine Butler fearlessly battled for women's rights, toppling laws that exploited the vulnerable.

Despite the new surroundings, Butler continued to mourn for Eva but focused her feelings on helping others; she later wrote that she \"became possessed with an irresistible urge to go forth and find some pain keener than my own, to meet with people more unhappy than myself. ... It was not difficult to find misery in Liverpool.\" She made regular visits to the workhouse at Brownlow Hill, an institution that could hold 5,000 individuals. She would sit with the women in the cellars\u2014many of whom were prisoners\u2014and pick oakum with them, while discussing the Bible or praying with them. Just as they had done in Cheltenham, the Butlers began providing shelter in their own home for some of the women, often prostitutes in the terminal stages of venereal disease. It soon became clear that there were more women in need than they could provide for, so Butler set up a hostel, with funds from local men of means. By Easter 1867 she had established a second, larger home, in which more appropriate work was provided, such as sewing and the manufacture of envelopes; the \"Industrial Home\", as she called it, was funded by the workhouse committee and local merchants. Butler campaigned for women's rights, including the right to the vote and to have a better education. In 1866 she was a signatory on a petition to amend the Reform Bill to widen the franchise to include women. The petition, which was supported by the MP and philosopher John Stuart Mill, was ignored and the bill became law. Butler considered the Liverpool hostels a stop-gap; women would continue to struggle to find employment until they had been better educated. In 1867, with the suffragist Anne Clough, she established the North of England Council for Promoting the Higher Education of Women, which aimed to raise the status of governesses and female teachers to that of a profession; She served as its president until 1873. A series of lectures, initially in towns in the north of England, began under James Stuart, a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Although it was thought thirty students would sign up, three hundred joined. In 1868 Butler published \"The Education and Employment of Women\", her first pamphlet, in which she argued for access to higher education for women, and more equal access to a wider range of jobs. It was the first of 90 books and pamphlets she wrote. That May she petitioned the senate of the University of Cambridge to provide examinations for women; the Cambridge Higher Examination for women was introduced the following year. Jordan notes that \"much of the credit for this should go to Anne Clough, but ... Butler played a very influential part ... of the campaign.\" At the time British law relating to marriage was based on the legal doctrine of coverture, in which a woman's legal rights and obligations were subsumed by those of her husband upon their matrimony. By law a woman had no separate legal existence, and all her property became her husband's; divorce initiated by a woman was difficult and complicated. In April 1868 Butler and fellow suffragist Elizabeth Wolstenholme set up and became joint secretaries of the Married Women's Property Committee to pressure parliament into changing the law. Butler remained on the committee until the campaign was successful, with the passing into law of the Married Women's Property Act 1882.","h_score":1788712.0625,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1791212,"revid":1171600204,"description":"English feminist and social reformer (1828\u20131906)","categories":["1828 births","1906 deaths","19th-century British writers","19th-century English women writers","19th-century English writers","Anglican writers","Anti-prostitution activists","British reformers","British social reformers","English feminists","English non-fiction writers","English suffragists","People from Wooler","Proponents of Christian feminism","Women of the Victorian era","Writers from Liverpool"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 10\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

The relevant law was contained in the Special Cantonments Acts which had been put on to a practical footing by Major-General Edward Chapman, who issued standing orders for the inspection of prostitutes, and the provision of \"a sufficient number of women, to take care that they are sufficiently attractive, to provide them with proper houses\". Butler began a new campaign to have the legislation repealed, comparing the girls to slaves. After the campaign put pressure on MPs, the widespread publication of Chapman's orders led to what Mathers describes as \"outrage across Britain\". In June 1888 the House of Commons passed a unanimous resolution repealing the legislation, and the Indian government was ordered to cancel the Acts. To circumvent the order, the India Office advised the Viceroy of India to instigate new legislation ensuring that prostitutes suspected of carrying contagious diseases had to undergo an examination or face expulsion from the cantonment. Towards the end of the 1880s George's health began to decline, and Butler spent increasing time looking after him. They holidayed in Naples in 1889, but George contracted influenza in the 1889\u201390 pandemic. They returned to Britain but George died on 14 March 1890; Butler suspended campaigning in the aftermath of his death. Soon after, she left Winchester, and moved to a house in Wimbledon, London, which she shared with her eldest son and his wife. Butler, at 62, felt she was too old to travel to India, but two American supporters visited on her behalf and spent four months building a dossier showing that the lock hospitals, compulsory examination and use of underage prostitutes\u2014some as young as 11\u2014were all continuing to operate. The campaign in Britain pushed again for changes, and Butler spoke at meetings, published pamphlets and wrote to missionaries in India. Although many of Butler's friends and supporters of shared causes spoke out against British Imperial Policy, Butler did not. She wrote that because of the work Britain had undertaken in making slavery illegal, \"[w]ith all her faults, looked at from God's point of view, England is the best, and the least guilty of the nations\". During the Second Boer War (1899\u20131902), Butler published Native Races and the War (1900), in which she supported British action and its imperialist policy. In the book she took a strong line against the casual racism inherent in her countrymen's dealings with foreigners, writing: > Great Britain will in future be judged, condemned or justified, according to her treatment of those innumerable, coloured races, heathen or partly Christianized, over whom her rule extends ... Race prejudice is a poison which will have to be cast out if the world is ever to be Christianized, and if Great Britain is to maintain the high and responsible place among the nations which has been given to her. From 1901 Butler began to withdraw from public life, resigning her positions in the campaign organisations and spending more time with her family. In 1903 she moved to Wooler in Northumberland, to live near her eldest son. On 30 December 1906 she died at home and was buried in the nearby village of Kirknewton.","h_score":1788712.0625,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":1791212,"revid":1171600204,"description":"English feminist and social reformer (1828\u20131906)","categories":["1828 births","1906 deaths","19th-century British writers","19th-century English women writers","19th-century English writers","Anglican writers","Anti-prostitution activists","British reformers","British social reformers","English feminists","English non-fiction writers","English suffragists","People from Wooler","Proponents of Christian feminism","Women of the Victorian era","Writers from Liverpool"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 8\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

His father J\u00f3zef was involved in the Polish National Democratic Party (\"Endecja\"), and the Lutos\u0142awski family became intimate with its founder, Roman Dmowski (Witold Lutos\u0142awski's middle name was Roman). J\u00f3zef Lutos\u0142awski studied in Z\u00fcrich, where in 1904 he met and married a fellow student, Maria Olszewska, who later became Lutos\u0142awski's mother. J\u00f3zef pursued his studies in London, where he acted as correspondent for the National-Democratic newspaper, Goniec. He continued to be involved in National Democracy politics after returning to Warsaw in 1905, and took over the management of the family estates in 1908. Witold Roman Lutos\u0142awski, the youngest of three brothers, was born in Warsaw shortly before the outbreak of World War I. In 1915, with Russia at war with Germany, Prussian forces drove towards Warsaw. The Lutos\u0142awskis travelled east to Moscow, where J\u00f3zef remained politically active, organising Polish Legions ready for any action that might liberate Poland (which had been divided over a century earlier\u2014Warsaw was part of Tsarist Russia). Dmowski's strategy was for Russia to guarantee security for a new Polish state. In 1917, the February Revolution forced the Tsar to abdicate, and the October Revolution started a new Soviet government that made peace with Germany. J\u00f3zef's activities were now in conflict with the Bolsheviks, who arrested him and his brother Marian. Thus, although fighting stopped on the Eastern Front in 1917, the Lutos\u0142awskis were prevented from returning home. The brothers were interned in Butyrskaya prison in central Moscow, where Witold\u2014by then aged five\u2014visited his father. J\u00f3zef and Marian were executed by a firing squad in September 1918, some days before their scheduled trial. After the war, the family returned to the newly independent Poland, only to find their estates ruined. After his father's death, other members of the family played an important part in Witold's early life, especially J\u00f3zef's half-brother Kazimierz Lutos\u0142awski, a priest and politician. At age six, Lutos\u0142awski started two years of piano lessons in Warsaw. After the Polish-Soviet War the family left Warsaw to return to Drozdowo, but after a few years of running the estates with limited success, his mother returned to Warsaw. She worked as a physician, and translated books for children from English. In 1924, Lutos\u0142awski entered secondary school (Stefan Batory Gymnasium) while continuing piano lessons. A performance of Karol Szymanowski's Third Symphony deeply affected him. In 1925, he started violin lessons at the Warsaw Music School. In 1931, he enrolled at Warsaw University to study mathematics, and in 1932 he formally joined the composition classes at the Conservatory. His only composition teacher was Witold Maliszewski, a renowned Polish composer who had been a pupil of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. Lutos\u0142awski was given a strong grounding in musical structures, particularly movements in sonata form. In 1932, he gave up the violin, and in 1933 he discontinued his mathematics studies to concentrate on the piano and composition. As a student of Jerzy Lefeld, he gained a diploma for piano performance from the Conservatory in 1936, after presenting a virtuoso program including Schumann's Toccata and Beethoven's fourth piano concerto. His diploma for composition was awarded by the same institution in 1937.","h_score":1928253.2437500001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":409576,"revid":1162006877,"description":"Polish composer and conductor (1913\u20131994)","categories":["1913 births","1994 deaths","20th-century classical composers","20th-century male musicians","Burials at Pow\u0105zki Cemetery","Chopin University of Music alumni","Deutsche Grammophon artists","EMI Classics and Virgin Classics artists","Ernst von Siemens Music Prize winners","Foreign members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts","Grammy Award winners","Herder Prize recipients","International Rostrum of Composers prize-winners","Kyoto laureates in Arts and Philosophy","Members of the Academy of Arts, Berlin","Musicians from Warsaw","Polish classical composers","Polish male classical composers","Recipients of the L\u00e9onie Sonning Music Prize","Recipients of the Order of the Banner of Work","Recipients of the Order of the Builders of People's Poland","Recipients of the Order of the White Eagle (Poland)","Recipients of the Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil class)","Recipients of the State Award Badge (Poland)","Royal Philharmonic Society Gold Medallists"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Witold Lutos\u0142awski?  \nA1: Witold Lutos\u0142awski was a Polish composer and conductor.

Chain 2 was written for Anne-Sophie Mutter (commissioned by Sacher), and for Mutter he also orchestrated his slightly earlier Partita for violin and piano, providing a new linking Interlude, so that when played together the Partita, Interlude, and Chain 2 form his longest work. In 1985, the Third Symphony earned Lutos\u0142awski the first Grawemeyer Prize from the University of Louisville, Kentucky. The significance of the prize lay not just in its prestige but in the size of its financial award (then US\\$150,000). The award is intended to remove recipients' financial concerns for a period to allow them to concentrate on serious composition. In a gesture of altruism, Lutos\u0142awski announced that he would use the fund to set up a scholarship to enable young Polish composers to study abroad; Lutos\u0142awski also directed that his fee from the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra for Chain 3 should go to this scholarship fund. In 1986, Lutos\u0142awski was presented (by Tippett) with the rarely awarded Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal during a concert in which Lutos\u0142awski conducted his Third Symphony; also that year a major celebration of his work was made at the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival. In addition, he was awarded honorary doctorates at several universities worldwide, including Cambridge. At this time Lutos\u0142awski was writing his Piano Concerto for Krystian Zimerman, commissioned by the Salzburg Festival. His earliest plans to write a piano concerto dated from 1938; he was himself in his younger days a virtuoso pianist. It was a performance of this work and the Third Symphony at the Warsaw Autumn Festival in 1988 that marked the composer's return to the conductor's podium in Poland, after substantive talks had been arranged between the government and the opposition. Around 1990 Lutos\u0142awski also worked on a fourth symphony and his orchestral song-cycle Chantefleurs et Chantefables for soprano. The latter was first performed at a Prom concert in London in 1991, and the Fourth Symphony in 1993 in Los Angeles. In between, and after initial reluctance, Lutos\u0142awski took on the presidency of the newly reconstituted \"Polish Cultural Council\", which was set up after the 1989 legislative elections led to the end of communist rule in Poland. In 1993, Lutos\u0142awski continued his busy schedule, travelling to the United States, England, Finland, Canada and Japan, and sketching a violin concerto, but by the first week of 1994 it was clear that cancer had taken hold, and after an operation the composer weakened quickly and died on 7 February, aged 81. He had, a few weeks before, been awarded Poland's highest honour, the Order of the White Eagle (only the second person to receive this since the collapse of communism in Poland\u2014the first had been Pope John Paul II). He was cremated; his wife Danuta died shortly afterwards. ## Music\n\nLutos\u0142awski described musical composition as a search for listeners who think and feel the same way he did\u2014he once called it \"fishing for souls\".\n\n ### Folk influence\n\nLutos\u0142awski's works up until and including the Dance Preludes (1955) show the influence of Polish folk music, both harmonically and melodically. Part of his art was in transforming folk music, rather than quoting it exactly. In some cases, such as the Concerto for Orchestra, folk music is unrecognisable as such without careful analysis. As Lutos\u0142awski developed the techniques of his mature compositions, he stopped using folk material explicitly, although its influence remained as subtle features until the end. As he said, \"[in those days] I could not compose as I wished, so I composed as I was able\", and about this change of direction he said, \"I was simply not so interested in it [using folk music]\". Also, Lutos\u0142awski was dissatisfied with composing in a \"post-tonal\" idiom: while composing the first symphony, he felt that this was for him a cul-de-sac. As such, Dance Preludes would prove to be his final composition centered around folk music; he described it as a \"farewell to folklore\".\n\n ### Pitch organisation\n\nIn Five Songs (1956\u201357) and Musique fun\u00e8bre (1958) Lutos\u0142awski introduced his own brand of twelve-tone music, marking his departure from the explicit use of folk music. His twelve-tone technique allowed him to build harmony and melody from specific intervals (in Musique fun\u00e8bre, augmented fourths and semitones). This system also gave him the means to write dense chords without resorting to tone clusters, and enabled him to build towards these dense chords (which often include all twelve notes of the chromatic scale) at climactic moments. Lutos\u0142awski's twelve-note techniques were thus completely different in conception from Arnold Schoenberg's tone-row system, although Musique fun\u00e8bre does happen to be based on a tone row. This twelve-note intervallic technique had its genesis in earlier works such as Symphony No. 1, and Variations on a Theme by Paganini.\n\n","h_score":1928253.2437500001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":409576,"revid":1162006877,"description":"Polish composer and conductor (1913\u20131994)","categories":["1913 births","1994 deaths","20th-century classical composers","20th-century male musicians","Burials at Pow\u0105zki Cemetery","Chopin University of Music alumni","Deutsche Grammophon artists","EMI Classics and Virgin Classics artists","Ernst von Siemens Music Prize winners","Foreign members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts","Grammy Award winners","Herder Prize recipients","International Rostrum of Composers prize-winners","Kyoto laureates in Arts and Philosophy","Members of the Academy of Arts, Berlin","Musicians from Warsaw","Polish classical composers","Polish male classical composers","Recipients of the L\u00e9onie Sonning Music Prize","Recipients of the Order of the Banner of Work","Recipients of the Order of the Builders of People's Poland","Recipients of the Order of the White Eagle (Poland)","Recipients of the Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil class)","Recipients of the State Award Badge (Poland)","Royal Philharmonic Society Gold Medallists"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Witold Lutos\u0142awski: Poland's Musical Trailblazer\n\nWitold Lutos\u0142awski was a renowned 20th-century Polish composer who blended folk traditions with avant-garde innovation.

He completed his Symphonic Variations in 1939. The work was premiered by the Polish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Grzegorz Fitelberg, with the performance broadcast on radio on 9 March 1939. Like most young Polish composers, Lutos\u0142awski wanted to continue his education in Paris. His plans for further musical study were dashed in September 1939, when Germany invaded western Poland and Russia invaded eastern Poland. Lutos\u0142awski was mobilised with the radio unit for the Krak\u00f3w Army. He was soon captured by German soldiers, but escaped while being marched to prison camp, walking 250 miles (400 km) back to Warsaw. Lutos\u0142awski's brother was captured by Russian soldiers and later died in a Siberian labour camp.\n\nTo earn a living, Lutos\u0142awski joined \"Dana Ensemble\", the first Polish revellers, as an arranger-pianist, singing in \"Ziemia\u0144ska Cafe\". He then formed a piano duo with friend and fellow composer Andrzej Panufnik, performing together in Warsaw caf\u00e9s. Their repertoire consisted of a wide range of music in their own arrangements, including the first incarnation of Lutos\u0142awski's Variations on a Theme by Paganini, a transcription of the 24th Caprice for solo violin by Niccol\u00f2 Paganini. Defiantly, they sometimes played Polish music (the Nazis banned Polish music in Poland\u2014including that of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin), and composed Resistance songs. Listening in caf\u00e9s was the only way in which the Poles of German-occupied Warsaw could hear live music; putting on concerts was impossible since the Germans occupying Poland prohibited any organised gatherings. In caf\u00e9 Aria, where they played, Lutos\u0142awski met his future wife Maria Danuta Bogus\u0142awska, a sister of the writer Stanis\u0142aw Dygat.\n\nLutos\u0142awski left Warsaw in July 1944 with his mother, just a few days before the Warsaw Uprising. During the complete destruction of the city by Germans after the failure of the uprising, most of his music was lost, as were the family's Drozdowo estates. He was able to salvage only a few scores and sketches; of the 200 or so arrangements that Lutos\u0142awski and Panufnik had worked on for their piano duo, only Lutos\u0142awski's Variations on a Theme by Paganini survived. Lutos\u0142awski returned to the ruins of Warsaw after the Polish-Soviet treaty in April 1945.\n\n","h_score":1928253.2437500001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":409576,"revid":1162006877,"description":"Polish composer and conductor (1913\u20131994)","categories":["1913 births","1994 deaths","20th-century classical composers","20th-century male musicians","Burials at Pow\u0105zki Cemetery","Chopin University of Music alumni","Deutsche Grammophon artists","EMI Classics and Virgin Classics artists","Ernst von Siemens Music Prize winners","Foreign members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts","Grammy Award winners","Herder Prize recipients","International Rostrum of Composers prize-winners","Kyoto laureates in Arts and Philosophy","Members of the Academy of Arts, Berlin","Musicians from Warsaw","Polish classical composers","Polish male classical composers","Recipients of the L\u00e9onie Sonning Music Prize","Recipients of the Order of the Banner of Work","Recipients of the Order of the Builders of People's Poland","Recipients of the Order of the White Eagle (Poland)","Recipients of the Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil class)","Recipients of the State Award Badge (Poland)","Royal Philharmonic Society Gold Medallists"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Enigmatic Genius: Witold Lutos\u0142awski's Musical Revolution\n\nIn a world of rigid notes, Polish composer Witold Lutos\u0142awski (1913-1994) wove chaos into harmony, blending classical precision with aleatoric chance to redefine modern music.

By 1956, political events had led to a partial thawing of the musical climate, and the Warsaw Autumn Festival of Contemporary Music was founded. Conceived as a biennial festival, it has been held annually ever since 1958 (except under Martial law in 1982 when, in protest, the ZKP refused to organise it). The first performance of his Musique fun\u00e8bre (in Polish, Muzyka \u017ca\u0142obna, English Funereal Music or Music of Mourning) took place in 1958. It was written to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the death of B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, but took the composer four years to complete. This work brought international recognition, and the annual ZKP prize and the International Rostrum of Composers prize in 1959. Lutos\u0142awski's harmonic and contrapuntal thinking were developed in this work, and in the Five songs of 1956\u201357, as he introduced his twelve-note system, he realised the fruits of many years of thought and experiment. Another new feature of his compositional technique became a Lutos\u0142awski signature: he introduced randomness into the exact synchronisation of various parts of the musical ensemble in Jeux v\u00e9nitiens (\"Venetian games\"). These harmonic and temporal techniques became part of every subsequent work, and were integral to his style. In a departure from his usually serious compositions in 1957 to 1963, Lutos\u0142awski also composed light music under the pseudonym Derwid. Mostly waltzes, tangos, foxtrots and slow-foxtrots for voice and piano, these pieces are in the genre of Polish actors' songs. Their place in Lutos\u0142awski's output may be seen as less incongruous in light of his own performances of cabaret music during the war, as well as his relationship by marriage to his wife's sister-in-law, the famous Polish cabaret singer Kalina J\u0119drusik. In 1963, Lutos\u0142awski fulfilled a commission for the Music Biennale Zagreb, his Trois po\u00e8mes d'Henri Michaux for chorus and orchestra. It was the first work he had written for a commission from abroad, and brought him further international acclaim. It earned him a second State Prize for music (Lutos\u0142awski was not cynical about the award this time), and he gained an agreement for the international publication of his music with Chester Music, then part of the Hansen publishing house. His String Quartet was first performed in Stockholm in 1965, followed the same year by the first performance of his orchestral song-cycle Paroles tiss\u00e9es. This shortened title was suggested by the poet Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Chabrun, who had published the poems as Quatre tapisseries pour la Ch\u00e2telaine de Vergi. The song cycle is dedicated to the tenor Peter Pears, who first performed it at the 1965 Aldeburgh Festival with the composer conducting. (The Festival was founded and organised by Benjamin Britten, with whom the composer formed a lasting friendship.) Shortly after this, Lutos\u0142awski started work on his Second Symphony, which had two premieres: Pierre Boulez conducted the second movement, Direct, in 1966, and when the first movement, H\u00e9sitant, was finished in 1967, the composer conducted a complete performance in Katowice. The Second Symphony is very different from a conventional classical symphony in structure, with Lutos\u0142awski using his many compositional innovations to build a large-scale, dramatic work worthy of the name. In 1968, the Symphony earned Lutos\u0142awski first prize from the International Music Council's International Rostrum of Composers, his third such award, confirming his growing international reputation.

His father J\u00f3zef was involved in the Polish National Democratic Party (\"Endecja\"), and the Lutos\u0142awski family became intimate with its founder, Roman Dmowski (Witold Lutos\u0142awski's middle name was Roman). J\u00f3zef Lutos\u0142awski studied in Z\u00fcrich, where in 1904 he met and married a fellow student, Maria Olszewska, who later became Lutos\u0142awski's mother. J\u00f3zef pursued his studies in London, where he acted as correspondent for the National-Democratic newspaper, Goniec. He continued to be involved in National Democracy politics after returning to Warsaw in 1905, and took over the management of the family estates in 1908. Witold Roman Lutos\u0142awski, the youngest of three brothers, was born in Warsaw shortly before the outbreak of World War I. In 1915, with Russia at war with Germany, Prussian forces drove towards Warsaw. The Lutos\u0142awskis travelled east to Moscow, where J\u00f3zef remained politically active, organising Polish Legions ready for any action that might liberate Poland (which had been divided over a century earlier\u2014Warsaw was part of Tsarist Russia). Dmowski's strategy was for Russia to guarantee security for a new Polish state. In 1917, the February Revolution forced the Tsar to abdicate, and the October Revolution started a new Soviet government that made peace with Germany. J\u00f3zef's activities were now in conflict with the Bolsheviks, who arrested him and his brother Marian. Thus, although fighting stopped on the Eastern Front in 1917, the Lutos\u0142awskis were prevented from returning home. The brothers were interned in Butyrskaya prison in central Moscow, where Witold\u2014by then aged five\u2014visited his father. J\u00f3zef and Marian were executed by a firing squad in September 1918, some days before their scheduled trial. After the war, the family returned to the newly independent Poland, only to find their estates ruined. After his father's death, other members of the family played an important part in Witold's early life, especially J\u00f3zef's half-brother Kazimierz Lutos\u0142awski, a priest and politician. At age six, Lutos\u0142awski started two years of piano lessons in Warsaw. After the Polish-Soviet War the family left Warsaw to return to Drozdowo, but after a few years of running the estates with limited success, his mother returned to Warsaw. She worked as a physician, and translated books for children from English. In 1924, Lutos\u0142awski entered secondary school (Stefan Batory Gymnasium) while continuing piano lessons. A performance of Karol Szymanowski's Third Symphony deeply affected him. In 1925, he started violin lessons at the Warsaw Music School. In 1931, he enrolled at Warsaw University to study mathematics, and in 1932 he formally joined the composition classes at the Conservatory.

Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend. At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909, Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club. Boult graduated in 1912, with a basic \"pass\" degree. He continued his musical education at the Leipzig Conservatory in 1912\u201313. Musician Hans Sitt was in charge of the conducting class, but Boult's main influence was Nikisch. He later recalled, \"I went to all his [Nikisch's] rehearsals and concerts in the Gewandhaus. ... He had an astonishing baton technique and great command of the orchestra: everything was indicated with absolute precision. But there were others who were greater interpreters.\" Boult admired Nikisch \"not so much for his musicianship but his amazing power of saying what he wanted with a bit of wood. He spoke very little\". This style was in accord with Boult's opinion that \"all conductors should be clad in an invisible Tarnhelm which makes it possible to enjoy the music without seeing any of the antics that go on\". He sang in choral festivals and at the Leeds Festival of 1913, where he watched Nikisch conduct. There he made the acquaintance of George Butterworth, and other British composers. Later that year Boult joined the musical staff of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, where his most important work was to assist with the first British production of Wagner's Parsifal, and do \"odd jobs with lighting cues\" while Nikisch conducted the Ring cycle.","h_score":1881975.7375,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":147537,"revid":1169795246,"description":"English conductor","categories":["1889 births","1983 deaths","20th-century British conductors (music)","20th-century male musicians","Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford","BBC Symphony Orchestra","BBC music executives","British male conductors (music)","Conductors (music) awarded knighthoods","Decca Records artists","English Unitarians","English conductors (music)","English justices of the peace","Knights Bachelor","Members of Leander Club","Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour","Musicians from Chester","People educated at Westminster School, London","People from Crosby, Merseyside","Presidents of the Independent Society of Musicians","Royal Philharmonic Society Gold Medallists","Unitarian Universalists","University of Music and Theatre Leipzig alumni"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Adrian Boult?  \nA1: Adrian Boult was a British conductor born in 1889 and died in 1983.  \n\nQ2: What was his early career like?  \nA2: He studied music at Oxford and Leipzig, starting as a teacher and assistant conductor.  \n\nQ3: Which orchestras did he lead?  \nA3: Boult conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the London Philharmonic.  \n\nQ4: What music did he focus on?  \nA4: He emphasized British composers like Elgar and Vaughan Williams in his performances.  \n\nQ5: How did he influence music?  \nA5: Boult promoted radio broadcasts of classical music and recorded extensively.  \n\nQ6: What was his conducting style?  \nA6: His style was precise and clear, emphasizing orchestral balance.  \n\nQ7: Did he receive awards?  \nA7: He was knighted in 1937 and received other honors for his contributions.  \n\nQ8: What is his legacy today?  \nA8: Boult is remembered for elevating British orchestral music, with many recordings still in use."}

His programme comprised orchestral works by Bach, Butterworth, Mozart, Schumann, Wagner and Hugo Wolf, interspersed with arias by Mozart and Verdi sung by Agnes Nicholls. Boult was declared medically unfit for active service during the First World War, and until 1916 he served as an orderly officer in a reserve unit. He was recruited by the War Office as a translator (he spoke good French, German and Italian). In his spare time he organised and conducted concerts, some of which were subsidised by his father, with the aims of giving work to orchestral players and bringing music to a wider audience. In 1918, Boult conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in a series of concerts that included important recent British works. Among them was the premi\u00e8re of a revised version of Vaughan Williams's A London Symphony, a performance which was \"rather spoilt by a Zeppelin raid\". His best-known premi\u00e8re of this period was Holst's The Planets. Boult conducted the first performance on 29 September 1918 to an invited audience of about 250. Holst later wrote on his copy of the score, \"This copy is the property of Adrian Boult who first caused The Planets to shine in public and thereby earned the gratitude of Gustav Holst.\" Elgar was another composer who had cause to be grateful to Boult. His Second Symphony had, since its premiere nine years earlier, received few performances. When Boult conducted it at the Queen's Hall in March 1920 to \"great applause\" and \"frantic enthusiasm\", the composer wrote to him: \"With the sounds ringing in my ears I send a word of thanks for your splendid conducting of the Sym. ... I feel that my reputation in the future is safe in your hands.\" Elgar's friend and biographer, the violinist W. H. Reed, wrote that Boult's performance of Elgar's neglected work brought \"the grandeur and nobility of the work\" to wider public attention. Boult took a wide variety of conducting jobs in the years following the war. In 1919, he succeeded Ernest Ansermet as musical director of Sergei Diaghilev's ballet company. Although Ansermet gave Boult all the help he could in his preparations, there were fourteen ballets in the company's repertory \u2013 none of which Boult knew. In only a short period, Boult was required to master such scores as Petrushka, The Firebird, Scheherazade, La Boutique fantasque and The Good-Humoured Ladies. In 1921, Boult conducted the British Symphony Orchestra for Vladimir Rosing's Opera Week at Aeolian Hall. He also took on an academic post. When Hugh Allen succeeded Sir Hubert Parry as principal of the Royal College of Music, he invited Boult to start a conducting class along the lines of Leipzig \u2013 the first such class in England. Boult ran the classes from 1919 to 1930. In 1921 he received a Doctorate of Music. When Raymond Roze, the founder of the British Symphony Orchestra died in March 1920, Boult took over. He conducted the orchestra, made up of professional musicians who had served in the Army during the First World War, in a series of concerts at the Kingsway Hall. ### Birmingham\n\nIn 1923 Boult conducted the first season of the Robert Mayer concerts for children, but his participation in the following season was prevented by his appointment in 1924 as conductor of the Birmingham Festival Choral Society. This led to his becoming musical director of the City of Birmingham Orchestra, where he remained in charge for six years, attracting widespread attention with his adventurous programmes.\n\nThe advantage of the Birmingham post was that for the first time in his life Boult not only had his own orchestra, but sole control of programming as well; the only time in his life, he later said, when that was so. The disadvantages were that the orchestra was inadequately funded, the available venues (including the Town Hall) were unsatisfactory, the Birmingham Post'''s music critic, A. J. Symons, was a constant thorn in Boult's side, and the local concert-going public had conservative tastes. Despite this conservatism, Boult programmed as much innovative music as was practical, including works by Mahler, Stravinsky and Bruckner. Such departures from the repertoire expected by the regular concert-goers depressed the box-office takings, requiring subsidies from private benefactors, including Boult's family.\n\nWhile at Birmingham Boult had the opportunity to conduct a number of operas, chiefly with the British National Opera Company, for which he conducted Die Walk\u00fcre and Otello. He also conducted a diverse range of operas from such composers as Purcell, Mozart and Vaughan Williams. In 1928 he succeeded Vaughan Williams as conductor of the Bach Choir in London, a position he held until 1931.\n\n","h_score":1881975.7375,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":147537,"revid":1169795246,"description":"English conductor","categories":["1889 births","1983 deaths","20th-century British conductors (music)","20th-century male musicians","Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford","BBC Symphony Orchestra","BBC music executives","British male conductors (music)","Conductors (music) awarded knighthoods","Decca Records artists","English Unitarians","English conductors (music)","English justices of the peace","Knights Bachelor","Members of Leander Club","Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour","Musicians from Chester","People educated at Westminster School, London","People from Crosby, Merseyside","Presidents of the Independent Society of Musicians","Royal Philharmonic Society Gold Medallists","Unitarian Universalists","University of Music and Theatre Leipzig alumni"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Adrian Boult?  \nA1: Adrian Boult was a celebrated British conductor born in 1889, who shaped orchestral music for decades.  \n\nQ2: What was his primary profession?  \nA2: He was a conductor, leading major orchestras with precise, elegant style.  \n\nQ3: When did he live and work?  \nA3: Boult lived from 1889 to 1983, active in the early 20th century's vibrant music scene.  \n\nQ4: Which orchestras did he lead?  \nA4: He notably conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra, bringing it global acclaim.  \n\nQ5: What composers did he favor?  \nA5: Boult excelled with British composers like Elgar and Vaughan Williams, infusing their works with warmth.  \n\nQ6: How did his style stand out?  \nA6: His conducting featured clear rhythms and vivid expression, making complex scores accessible.  \n\nQ7: What awards did he receive?  \nA7: Boult earned knighthood and numerous honors for his musical contributions.  \n\nQ8: What is his lasting legacy?  \nA8: He influenced modern conducting with his dedication, inspiring generations to cherish orchestral depth."}

Brought up in a prosperous mercantile family, he followed musical studies in England and at Leipzig, Germany, with early conducting work in London for the Royal Opera House and Sergei Diaghilev's ballet company. His first prominent post was conductor of the City of Birmingham Orchestra in 1924. When the British Broadcasting Corporation appointed him director of music in 1930, he established the BBC Symphony Orchestra and became its chief conductor. The orchestra set standards of excellence that were rivalled in Britain only by the London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO), founded two years later.\n\nForced to leave the BBC in 1950 on reaching retirement age, Boult took on the chief conductorship of the LPO. The orchestra had declined from its peak of the 1930s, but under his guidance its fortunes were revived. He retired as its chief conductor in 1957, and later accepted the post of president. Although in the latter part of his career he worked with other orchestras, including the London Symphony Orchestra, the Philharmonia Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and his former orchestra, the BBC Symphony, it was the LPO with which he was primarily associated, conducting it in concerts and recordings until 1978, in what was widely called his \"Indian summer\".\n\nBoult was known for his championing of British music. He gave the first performance of his friend Gustav Holst's The Planets, and introduced new works by, among others, Elgar, Bliss, Britten, Delius, Rootham, Tippett, Vaughan Williams and Walton. In his BBC years, he introduced works by foreign composers, including Bart\u00f3k, Berg, Stravinsky, Schoenberg and Webern. A modest man who disliked the limelight, Boult felt as comfortable in the recording studio as on the concert platform, making recordings throughout his career. From the mid-1960s until his retirement after his last sessions in 1978 he recorded extensively for EMI. As well as a series of recordings that have remained in the catalogue for three or four decades, Boult's legacy includes his influence on prominent conductors of later generations, including Sir Colin Davis and Vernon Handley.\n\n ## Biography\n\n","h_score":1881975.7375,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":147537,"revid":1169795246,"description":"English conductor","categories":["1889 births","1983 deaths","20th-century British conductors (music)","20th-century male musicians","Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford","BBC Symphony Orchestra","BBC music executives","British male conductors (music)","Conductors (music) awarded knighthoods","Decca Records artists","English Unitarians","English conductors (music)","English justices of the peace","Knights Bachelor","Members of Leander Club","Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour","Musicians from Chester","People educated at Westminster School, London","People from Crosby, Merseyside","Presidents of the Independent Society of Musicians","Royal Philharmonic Society Gold Medallists","Unitarian Universalists","University of Music and Theatre Leipzig alumni"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Adrian Boult?  \nA1: Adrian Boult was a legendary British conductor, born in 1889, who waved his baton like a magic wand over orchestras.  \n\nQ2: When and where was he born?  \nA2: He entered the world in Chester, England, on April 8, 1889, kicking off a symphonic saga.  \n\nQ3: What was his main profession?  \nA3: Boult mastered conducting, leading ensembles with fiery flair and British poise.  \n\nQ4: Which orchestras did he lead?  \nA4: He helmed the BBC Symphony Orchestra prominently, infusing it with vivid energy.  \n\nQ5: Who influenced his style?  \nA5: Elgar and Vaughan Williams shaped his expressive, whimsical interpretations.  \n\nQ6: What were his key achievements?  \nA6: Boult recorded timeless classics, earning knighthood for his orchestral wizardry.  \n\nQ7: How is he remembered today?  \nA7: As a pillar of British music, his legacy dances in concert halls worldwide.  \n\nQ8: What was his impact on modern conducting?  \nA8: Boult's precise yet playful approach still inspires conductors to explore unexpected depths."}

Nevertheless, he was invited to conduct in Vienna, Amsterdam and Boston. In 1964 he made no recordings, but in 1965 he began an association with Lyrita records, an independent label specialising in British music. In the same year he resumed recording for EMI after a six-year break. Celebrations for his eightieth birthday in 1969 also raised his profile in the musical world. After the death of his colleague Sir John Barbirolli in 1970, Boult was seen as \"the sole survivor of a great generation\" and a living link with Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Holst. In the words of The Guardian, \"it was when he reached his late seventies that the final and most glorious period of his career developed.\" He ceased to accept overseas invitations, but conducted in the major British cities, as well as at the Festival and Albert Halls and began what is frequently called his \"Indian Summer\" in the concert hall and recording studio. He was featured in a 1971 film The Point of the Stick, in which he illustrated his conducting technique with musical examples.\n\nAt a spare recording session in August 1970 Boult recorded the Third Symphony of Brahms. This was well received and led to a series of recordings of Brahms, Wagner, Schubert, Mozart and Beethoven. His repertoire in general was much wider than his discography might suggest. It was a disappointment to him that he was rarely invited to conduct in the opera house, and he relished the opportunity to record extensive excerpts from the Wagner operas in the 1970s.

His programme comprised orchestral works by Bach, Butterworth, Mozart, Schumann, Wagner and Hugo Wolf, interspersed with arias by Mozart and Verdi sung by Agnes Nicholls. Boult was declared medically unfit for active service during the First World War, and until 1916 he served as an orderly officer in a reserve unit. He was recruited by the War Office as a translator (he spoke good French, German and Italian). In his spare time he organised and conducted concerts, some of which were subsidised by his father, with the aims of giving work to orchestral players and bringing music to a wider audience. In 1918, Boult conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in a series of concerts that included important recent British works. Among them was the premi\u00e8re of a revised version of Vaughan Williams's A London Symphony, a performance which was \"rather spoilt by a Zeppelin raid\". His best-known premi\u00e8re of this period was Holst's The Planets. Boult conducted the first performance on 29 September 1918 to an invited audience of about 250. Holst later wrote on his copy of the score, \"This copy is the property of Adrian Boult who first caused The Planets to shine in public and thereby earned the gratitude of Gustav Holst.\" Elgar was another composer who had cause to be grateful to Boult. His Second Symphony had, since its premiere nine years earlier, received few performances. When Boult conducted it at the Queen's Hall in March 1920 to \"great applause\" and \"frantic enthusiasm\", the composer wrote to him: \"With the sounds ringing in my ears I send a word of thanks for your splendid conducting of the Sym. ... I feel that my reputation in the future is safe in your hands.\" Elgar's friend and biographer, the violinist W. H. Reed, wrote that Boult's performance of Elgar's neglected work brought \"the grandeur and nobility of the work\" to wider public attention. Boult took a wide variety of conducting jobs in the years following the war. In 1919, he succeeded Ernest Ansermet as musical director of Sergei Diaghilev's ballet company. Although Ansermet gave Boult all the help he could in his preparations, there were fourteen ballets in the company's repertory \u2013 none of which Boult knew. In only a short period, Boult was required to master such scores as Petrushka, The Firebird, Scheherazade, La Boutique fantasque and The Good-Humoured Ladies. In 1921, Boult conducted the British Symphony Orchestra for Vladimir Rosing's Opera Week at Aeolian Hall. He also took on an academic post. When Hugh Allen succeeded Sir Hubert Parry as principal of the Royal College of Music, he invited Boult to start a conducting class along the lines of Leipzig \u2013 the first such class in England. Boult ran the classes from 1919 to 1930. In 1921 he received a Doctorate of Music. When Raymond Roze, the founder of the British Symphony Orchestra died in March 1920, Boult took over. He conducted the orchestra, made up of professional musicians who had served in the Army during the First World War, in a series of concerts at the Kingsway Hall. ### Birmingham\n\nIn 1923 Boult conducted the first season of the Robert Mayer concerts for children, but his participation in the following season was prevented by his appointment in 1924 as conductor of the Birmingham Festival Choral Society. This led to his becoming musical director of the City of Birmingham Orchestra, where he remained in charge for six years, attracting widespread attention with his adventurous programmes.\n\nThe advantage of the Birmingham post was that for the first time in his life Boult not only had his own orchestra, but sole control of programming as well; the only time in his life, he later said, when that was so. The disadvantages were that the orchestra was inadequately funded, the available venues (including the Town Hall) were unsatisfactory, the Birmingham Post'''s music critic, A. J. Symons, was a constant thorn in Boult's side, and the local concert-going public had conservative tastes. Despite this conservatism, Boult programmed as much innovative music as was practical, including works by Mahler, Stravinsky and Bruckner. Such departures from the repertoire expected by the regular concert-goers depressed the box-office takings, requiring subsidies from private benefactors, including Boult's family.\n\nWhile at Birmingham Boult had the opportunity to conduct a number of operas, chiefly with the British National Opera Company, for which he conducted Die Walk\u00fcre and Otello. He also conducted a diverse range of operas from such composers as Purcell, Mozart and Vaughan Williams. In 1928 he succeeded Vaughan Williams as conductor of the Bach Choir in London, a position he held until 1931.\n\n","h_score":1881975.7375,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":147537,"revid":1169795246,"description":"English conductor","categories":["1889 births","1983 deaths","20th-century British conductors (music)","20th-century male musicians","Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford","BBC Symphony Orchestra","BBC music executives","British male conductors (music)","Conductors (music) awarded knighthoods","Decca Records artists","English Unitarians","English conductors (music)","English justices of the peace","Knights Bachelor","Members of Leander Club","Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour","Musicians from Chester","People educated at Westminster School, London","People from Crosby, Merseyside","Presidents of the Independent Society of Musicians","Royal Philharmonic Society Gold Medallists","Unitarian Universalists","University of Music and Theatre Leipzig alumni"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Adrian Boult: The Maestro's Timeless Baton\n\nAdrian Boult was a pivotal British conductor who shaped 20th-century orchestral music with his precise interpretations.

Sir Thomas Beecham and the director general of the BBC Sir John Reith were keen to establish a first-class symphony orchestra, and they agreed in principle to do so jointly. Only a small number of core players were recruited before negotiations foundered. Beecham withdrew, and with Malcolm Sargent soon established the rival London Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1930 Boult returned to London to succeed Percy Pitt as director of music at the BBC. On taking up the post, Boult and his department recruited enough musicians to bring the complement of the new BBC Symphony Orchestra to 114. A substantial number of these players performed at the 1930 Promenade Concerts under Sir Henry Wood, and the full BBC Symphony Orchestra gave its first concert on 22 October 1930, conducted by Boult at the Queen's Hall. The programme consisted of music by Wagner, Brahms, Saint-Sa\u00ebns and Ravel. Of the 21 programmes in the orchestra's first season, Boult conducted nine and Wood five. The reviews of the new orchestra were enthusiastic. The Times wrote of its \"virtuosity\" and of Boult's \"superb\" conducting. The Musical Times commented, \"The boast of the B. B. C.that it intended to get together a first-class orchestra was not an idle one\" and spoke of \"exhilaration\" at the playing. The Observer called the playing \"altogether magnificent\" and said that Boult \"deserves an instrument of this fine calibre to work on, and the orchestra deserves a conductor of his efficiency and insight.\" After the initial concerts Reith was told by his advisers that the orchestra had played better for Boult than anyone else. Reith asked him if he wished to take on the chief conductorship, and if so whether he would resign as director of music or occupy both posts simultaneously. Boult opted for the latter. He later said that this was a rash decision, and that he could not have sustained the two roles at once without the efforts of his staff in the music department, which included Edward Clark, Julian Herbage and Kenneth Wright. During the 1930s the BBC Symphony Orchestra became renowned for its high standard of playing and for Boult's capable performances of new and unfamiliar music. Like Henry Wood before him, Boult regarded it as his duty to give the best possible performances of a wide range of composers, including those whose works were not personally congenial to him.","h_score":1881975.7375,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":147537,"revid":1169795246,"description":"English conductor","categories":["1889 births","1983 deaths","20th-century British conductors (music)","20th-century male musicians","Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford","BBC Symphony Orchestra","BBC music executives","British male conductors (music)","Conductors (music) awarded knighthoods","Decca Records artists","English Unitarians","English conductors (music)","English justices of the peace","Knights Bachelor","Members of Leander Club","Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour","Musicians from Chester","People educated at Westminster School, London","People from Crosby, Merseyside","Presidents of the Independent Society of Musicians","Royal Philharmonic Society Gold Medallists","Unitarian Universalists","University of Music and Theatre Leipzig alumni"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 10\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

Brought up in a prosperous mercantile family, he followed musical studies in England and at Leipzig, Germany, with early conducting work in London for the Royal Opera House and Sergei Diaghilev's ballet company. His first prominent post was conductor of the City of Birmingham Orchestra in 1924. When the British Broadcasting Corporation appointed him director of music in 1930, he established the BBC Symphony Orchestra and became its chief conductor. The orchestra set standards of excellence that were rivalled in Britain only by the London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO), founded two years later.\n\nForced to leave the BBC in 1950 on reaching retirement age, Boult took on the chief conductorship of the LPO. The orchestra had declined from its peak of the 1930s, but under his guidance its fortunes were revived. He retired as its chief conductor in 1957, and later accepted the post of president. Although in the latter part of his career he worked with other orchestras, including the London Symphony Orchestra, the Philharmonia Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and his former orchestra, the BBC Symphony, it was the LPO with which he was primarily associated, conducting it in concerts and recordings until 1978, in what was widely called his \"Indian summer\".\n\nBoult was known for his championing of British music. He gave the first performance of his friend Gustav Holst's The Planets, and introduced new works by, among others, Elgar, Bliss, Britten, Delius, Rootham, Tippett, Vaughan Williams and Walton. In his BBC years, he introduced works by foreign composers, including Bart\u00f3k, Berg, Stravinsky, Schoenberg and Webern. A modest man who disliked the limelight, Boult felt as comfortable in the recording studio as on the concert platform, making recordings throughout his career. From the mid-1960s until his retirement after his last sessions in 1978 he recorded extensively for EMI. As well as a series of recordings that have remained in the catalogue for three or four decades, Boult's legacy includes his influence on prominent conductors of later generations, including Sir Colin Davis and Vernon Handley.\n\n ## Biography\n\n","h_score":1881975.7375,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":147537,"revid":1169795246,"description":"English conductor","categories":["1889 births","1983 deaths","20th-century British conductors (music)","20th-century male musicians","Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford","BBC Symphony Orchestra","BBC music executives","British male conductors (music)","Conductors (music) awarded knighthoods","Decca Records artists","English Unitarians","English conductors (music)","English justices of the peace","Knights Bachelor","Members of Leander Club","Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour","Musicians from Chester","People educated at Westminster School, London","People from Crosby, Merseyside","Presidents of the Independent Society of Musicians","Royal Philharmonic Society Gold Medallists","Unitarian Universalists","University of Music and Theatre Leipzig alumni"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 8\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \"seriously jeopardized financially\" if Russell remained in post. A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall. In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre. In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony \"rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring\", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon, Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams. In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia. Boult had not wished to go on the tour because flying hurt his ears, and long land journeys hurt his back. The Soviet authorities threatened to cancel the tour if he did not lead it, and he felt obliged to go. The LPO gave nine concerts in Moscow and four in Leningrad. Boult's assistant conductors were Anatole Fistoulari and George Hurst. Boult's four Moscow programmes included Vaughan Williams's Fourth and Fifth Symphonies, Holst's The Planets, Walton's Violin Concerto (with Alfredo Campoli as soloist), and Schubert's Great C major Symphony. While in Moscow, Boult and his wife visited the Bolshoi Opera and were guests at the composer Dmitri Shostakovich's 50th birthday party. After the Russian tour, Boult told the LPO that he wished to step down from the principal conductorship. He continued to be the orchestra's main conductor until his successor William Steinberg took up the post in 1959. After the sudden resignation of Andrzej Panufnik from the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO), Boult returned as principal conductor of the CBSO for the 1959\u201360 season. That was his last chief conductorship, though he remained closely associated with the LPO as its president and a guest conductor until his retirement.","h_score":1881975.7375,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":147537,"revid":1169795246,"description":"English conductor","categories":["1889 births","1983 deaths","20th-century British conductors (music)","20th-century male musicians","Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford","BBC Symphony Orchestra","BBC music executives","British male conductors (music)","Conductors (music) awarded knighthoods","Decca Records artists","English Unitarians","English conductors (music)","English justices of the peace","Knights Bachelor","Members of Leander Club","Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour","Musicians from Chester","People educated at Westminster School, London","People from Crosby, Merseyside","Presidents of the Independent Society of Musicians","Royal Philharmonic Society Gold Medallists","Unitarian Universalists","University of Music and Theatre Leipzig alumni"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade 10\n\n**Learning Objectives:**\n1.

A comedy about apparent patricide, it attracted a hostile reaction from sections of the Irish public. The Freeman's Journal described it as \"an unmitigated, protracted libel upon Irish peasant men, and worse still upon Irish girlhood\". Arthur Griffith, who believed that the Abbey Theatre was insufficiently politically committed, described the play as \"a vile and inhuman story told in the foulest language we have ever listened to from a public platform\", and perceived a slight on the virtue of Irish womanhood in the line \"... a drift of chosen females, standing in their shifts ...\" At the time, a shift was known as a symbol representing Kitty O'Shea and her adulterous relationship with Charles Stuart Parnell.\n\nA section of the audience at the opening rioted, causing the third act to be acted out in dumbshow. The disturbances continued for a week, interrupting the following performances. Years later, after a similar disturbance at the opening of The Plough and the Stars by Se\u00e1n O'Casey, Yeats said the audience had \"disgraced yourselves again. Is this to be an ever-recurring celebration of the arrival of Irish genius? Synge first and then O'Casey?\"\n\nAlthough the writing of The Tinker's Wedding began at the same time as Riders to the Sea and In the Shadow of the Glen, it took Synge five years to complete, and was not finished in 1907. Riders was performed in the Racquet Court theatre in Galway on 4\u20138 January 1907, but not performed again until 1909, and only then in London. The first critic to respond to the play was Daniel Corkery, who said, \"One is sorry Synge ever wrote so poor a thing, and one fails to understand why it ever should have been staged anywhere.\"\n\n ## Death\n\nSynge died from Hodgkin lymphoma at the Elpis Nursing Home in Dublin on 24 March 1909, aged 37, and was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery, Harold's Cross, Dublin. A collected volume, Poems and Translations, with a preface by Yeats, was published by the Cuala Press on 8 April 1909. Yeats and actress and one-time fianc\u00e9e Molly Allgood (Maire O'Neill) completed Synge's unfinished final play, Deirdre of the Sorrows, and it was presented by the Abbey players on Thursday 13 January 1910, with Allgood as Deirdre.\n\n ## Personality\n\nJohn Masefield, who knew Synge, wrote that he \"gave one from the first the impression of a strange personality\". Masefield said that Synge's view of life originated in his poor health. In particular, Masefield said \"His relish of the savagery made me feel that he was a dying man clutching at life, and clutching most wildly at violent life, as the sick man does\".\n\nYeats described Synge as timid and shy, who \"never spoke an unkind word\" yet his art could \"fill the streets with rioters\". Richard Ellmann, the biographer of Yeats and James Joyce, stated that Synge \"built a fantastic drama out of Irish life.\n\nYeats described Synge in the poem \"In Memory of Major Robert Gregory\":\n\n...And that enquiring man John Synge comes next,\n\nThat dying chose the living world for text\n\nAnd never could have rested in the tomb\n\nBut that, long travelling, he had come\n\nTowards nightfall upon certain set apart\n\nIn a most desolate stony place,\n\nTowards nightfall upon a race\n\nPassionate and simple like his heart.\n\nSynge was a political radical, immersed in the socialist literature of William Morris, and in his own words \"wanted to change things root and branch\". Much to the consternation of his mother, he went to Paris in 1896 to become more involved in radical politics, and his interest in the topic lasted until his dying days when he sought to engage his nurses on the topic of feminism.\n\n","h_score":1941876.1125,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":349496,"revid":1171657988,"description":"Irish playwright, poet, prose writer, and collector of folklore","categories":["1871 births","1909 deaths","19th-century Irish dramatists and playwrights","19th-century Irish poets","19th-century male writers","20th-century Irish dramatists and playwrights","20th-century Irish poets","20th-century male writers","Abbey Theatre","Alumni of Trinity College Dublin","Alumni of the Royal Irish Academy of Music","Burials at Mount Jerome Cemetery and Crematorium","Deaths from Hodgkin lymphoma","Deaths from cancer in Ireland","Irish Anglicans","Irish male dramatists and playwrights","Irish male poets","People from Rathfarnham","Synge family","University of Paris alumni","Writers from County Dublin"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was John Millington Synge?  \nA1: John Millington Synge was an Irish playwright and poet.

His father John Hatch Synge was a barrister, and came from a family of landed gentry in Glanmore Castle, County Wicklow. Synge's paternal grandfather, also named John Synge, was an evangelical Christian involved in the movement that became the Plymouth Brethren, and his maternal grandfather, Robert Traill, was a Church of Ireland rector in Schull, County Cork, who died in 1847 during the Great Irish Famine. He was a descendant of Edward Synge, Archbishop of Tuam, and Edward's son Nicholas, the Bishop of Killaloe. His nephews included mathematician John Lighton Synge and optical microscopy pioneer Edward Hutchinson Synge.[^1]\n\nSynge's father died from smallpox in 1872 at the age of 49. He was buried on his son's first birthday. His mother moved the family to the house next door to her own mother's house in Rathgar, County Dublin. Although often ill, Synge had a happy childhood there. He developed an interest in bird-watching along the banks of the River Dodder, and during family holidays at the seaside resort of Greystones, County Wicklow, and the family estate at Glanmore.\n\nSynge was educated at home and at times at schools in Dublin and Bray, and later studied piano, flute, violin, music theory and counterpoint at the Royal Irish Academy of Music. He travelled to the continent to study music, but changed his mind and decided to focus on literature. He was a talented student and won a scholarship in counterpoint in 1891. The family moved to the suburb of Kingstown (now D\u00fan Laoghaire) in 1888, and Synge entered Trinity College, Dublin, the following year. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1892, having studied Irish and Hebrew, as well as continuing his music studies and playing with the Academy Orchestra in the Antient Concert Rooms. Between November 1889 and 1894 he took private music lessons with Robert Prescott Stewart.\n\nSynge later developed an interest in Irish antiquities and the Aran Islands, and became a member of the Irish League for a year. He left the League because, as he told Maud Gonne, \"my theory of regeneration for Ireland differs from yours ... I wish to work on my own for the cause of Ireland, and I shall never be able to do so if I get mixed up with a revolutionary and semi-military movement.\" In 1893 he published his first known work, a poem influenced by Wordsworth, Kottabos: A College Miscellany.\n\n ### Early work\n\nAfter graduating, Synge moved to Germany to study music. He stayed in Coblenz during 1893 and moved to W\u00fcrzburg in January 1894. Owing partly to his shyness about performing in public, and partly to his doubt about his ability, he decided to abandon music and pursue his literary interests. He returned to Ireland in June 1894, and moved to Paris in January 1895 to study literature and languages at the Sorbonne.\n\nHe met Cherrie Matheson during summer breaks with his family in Dublin. He proposed to her in 1895 and again the next year, but she turned him down on both occasions because of their differing views on religion. This rejection affected Synge greatly and reinforced his determination to spend as much time as possible outside Ireland.\n\nIn 1896, he visited Italy to study the language before returning to Paris. He planned on making a career in writing about French authors for the English press. In that same year he met W. B. Yeats, who encouraged him to live for a while in the Aran Islands, and then return to Dublin and devote himself to creative work. In 1899 he joined with Yeats, Augusta, Lady Gregory, and George William Russell to form the Irish National Theatre Society, which later established the Abbey Theatre. He wrote some pieces of literary criticism for Gonne's Irlande Libre and other journals, as well as unpublished poems and prose in a decadent fin de si\u00e8cle style.

A comedy about apparent patricide, it attracted a hostile reaction from sections of the Irish public. The Freeman's Journal described it as \"an unmitigated, protracted libel upon Irish peasant men, and worse still upon Irish girlhood\". Arthur Griffith, who believed that the Abbey Theatre was insufficiently politically committed, described the play as \"a vile and inhuman story told in the foulest language we have ever listened to from a public platform\", and perceived a slight on the virtue of Irish womanhood in the line \"... a drift of chosen females, standing in their shifts ...\" At the time, a shift was known as a symbol representing Kitty O'Shea and her adulterous relationship with Charles Stuart Parnell.\n\nA section of the audience at the opening rioted, causing the third act to be acted out in dumbshow. The disturbances continued for a week, interrupting the following performances. Years later, after a similar disturbance at the opening of The Plough and the Stars by Se\u00e1n O'Casey, Yeats said the audience had \"disgraced yourselves again. Is this to be an ever-recurring celebration of the arrival of Irish genius? Synge first and then O'Casey?\"\n\nAlthough the writing of The Tinker's Wedding began at the same time as Riders to the Sea and In the Shadow of the Glen, it took Synge five years to complete, and was not finished in 1907. Riders was performed in the Racquet Court theatre in Galway on 4\u20138 January 1907, but not performed again until 1909, and only then in London. The first critic to respond to the play was Daniel Corkery, who said, \"One is sorry Synge ever wrote so poor a thing, and one fails to understand why it ever should have been staged anywhere.\"\n\n ## Death\n\nSynge died from Hodgkin lymphoma at the Elpis Nursing Home in Dublin on 24 March 1909, aged 37, and was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery, Harold's Cross, Dublin. A collected volume, Poems and Translations, with a preface by Yeats, was published by the Cuala Press on 8 April 1909. Yeats and actress and one-time fianc\u00e9e Molly Allgood (Maire O'Neill) completed Synge's unfinished final play, Deirdre of the Sorrows, and it was presented by the Abbey players on Thursday 13 January 1910, with Allgood as Deirdre.\n\n ## Personality\n\nJohn Masefield, who knew Synge, wrote that he \"gave one from the first the impression of a strange personality\". Masefield said that Synge's view of life originated in his poor health. In particular, Masefield said \"His relish of the savagery made me feel that he was a dying man clutching at life, and clutching most wildly at violent life, as the sick man does\".\n\nYeats described Synge as timid and shy, who \"never spoke an unkind word\" yet his art could \"fill the streets with rioters\". Richard Ellmann, the biographer of Yeats and James Joyce, stated that Synge \"built a fantastic drama out of Irish life.\n\nYeats described Synge in the poem \"In Memory of Major Robert Gregory\":\n\n...And that enquiring man John Synge comes next,\n\nThat dying chose the living world for text\n\nAnd never could have rested in the tomb\n\nBut that, long travelling, he had come\n\nTowards nightfall upon certain set apart\n\nIn a most desolate stony place,\n\nTowards nightfall upon a race\n\nPassionate and simple like his heart.\n\nSynge was a political radical, immersed in the socialist literature of William Morris, and in his own words \"wanted to change things root and branch\". Much to the consternation of his mother, he went to Paris in 1896 to become more involved in radical politics, and his interest in the topic lasted until his dying days when he sought to engage his nurses on the topic of feminism.\n\n","h_score":1941876.1125,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":349496,"revid":1171657988,"description":"Irish playwright, poet, prose writer, and collector of folklore","categories":["1871 births","1909 deaths","19th-century Irish dramatists and playwrights","19th-century Irish poets","19th-century male writers","20th-century Irish dramatists and playwrights","20th-century Irish poets","20th-century male writers","Abbey Theatre","Alumni of Trinity College Dublin","Alumni of the Royal Irish Academy of Music","Burials at Mount Jerome Cemetery and Crematorium","Deaths from Hodgkin lymphoma","Deaths from cancer in Ireland","Irish Anglicans","Irish male dramatists and playwrights","Irish male poets","People from Rathfarnham","Synge family","University of Paris alumni","Writers from County Dublin"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was John Millington Synge?  \nA1: Synge was an Irish playwright and poet, a fiery spirit of the Irish Literary Revival.  \n\nQ2: When and where was he born?  \nA2: Born in 1871 in Rathfarnham, near Dublin, he wandered Ireland's wild landscapes for inspiration.  \n\nQ3: What inspired his work?  \nA3: Rural Irish life and folklore fueled his plays, blending raw beauty with edgy humor.  \n\nQ4: What are his famous plays?  \nA4: \"The Playboy of the Western World\" stirred riots with its cheeky chaos, alongside \"Riders to the Sea.\"  \n\nQ5: Why was his work controversial?  \nA5: It mocked Irish stereotypes boldly, sparking fights in theaters with its vivid, unfiltered truths.  \n\nQ6: How did he influence literature?  \nA6: Synge's vivid dialogue shaped modern Irish drama, inspiring Yeats and Joyce with unexpected twists.  \n\nQ7: What about his personal life?  \nA7: A loner who roamed the Aran Islands, his health faded early, dying at 38 in poetic shadows.  \n\nQ8: What's his legacy today?  \nA8: Synge's wild words still echo in theater, a playful rebel redefining Irish identity vividly."}

A comedy about apparent patricide, it attracted a hostile reaction from sections of the Irish public. The Freeman's Journal described it as \"an unmitigated, protracted libel upon Irish peasant men, and worse still upon Irish girlhood\". Arthur Griffith, who believed that the Abbey Theatre was insufficiently politically committed, described the play as \"a vile and inhuman story told in the foulest language we have ever listened to from a public platform\", and perceived a slight on the virtue of Irish womanhood in the line \"... a drift of chosen females, standing in their shifts ...\" At the time, a shift was known as a symbol representing Kitty O'Shea and her adulterous relationship with Charles Stuart Parnell.\n\nA section of the audience at the opening rioted, causing the third act to be acted out in dumbshow.

Synge first and then O'Casey?\"\n\nAlthough the writing of The Tinker's Wedding began at the same time as Riders to the Sea and In the Shadow of the Glen, it took Synge five years to complete, and was not finished in 1907. Riders was performed in the Racquet Court theatre in Galway on 4\u20138 January 1907, but not performed again until 1909, and only then in London. The first critic to respond to the play was Daniel Corkery, who said, \"One is sorry Synge ever wrote so poor a thing, and one fails to understand why it ever should have been staged anywhere.\"\n\n ## Death\n\nSynge died from Hodgkin lymphoma at the Elpis Nursing Home in Dublin on 24 March 1909, aged 37, and was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery, Harold's Cross, Dublin. A collected volume, Poems and Translations, with a preface by Yeats, was published by the Cuala Press on 8 April 1909. Yeats and actress and one-time fianc\u00e9e Molly Allgood (Maire O'Neill) completed Synge's unfinished final play, Deirdre of the Sorrows, and it was presented by the Abbey players on Thursday 13 January 1910, with Allgood as Deirdre.\n\n ## Personality\n\nJohn Masefield, who knew Synge, wrote that he \"gave one from the first the impression of a strange personality\". Masefield said that Synge's view of life originated in his poor health. In particular, Masefield said \"His relish of the savagery made me feel that he was a dying man clutching at life, and clutching most wildly at violent life, as the sick man does\".\n\nYeats described Synge as timid and shy, who \"never spoke an unkind word\" yet his art could \"fill the streets with rioters\". Richard Ellmann, the biographer of Yeats and James Joyce, stated that Synge \"built a fantastic drama out of Irish life.\n\nYeats described Synge in the poem \"In Memory of Major Robert Gregory\":\n\n...And that enquiring man John Synge comes next,\n\nThat dying chose the living world for text\n\nAnd never could have rested in the tomb\n\nBut that, long travelling, he had come\n\nTowards nightfall upon certain set apart\n\nIn a most desolate stony place,\n\nTowards nightfall upon a race\n\nPassionate and simple like his heart.\n\nSynge was a political radical, immersed in the socialist literature of William Morris, and in his own words \"wanted to change things root and branch\".

He visited Lady Gregory's home, at Coole Park near Gort, County Galway, where he met Yeats again and also Edward Martyn. He spent the following five summers there, collecting stories and folklore, perfecting his Irish, but living in Paris for most of the rest of each year. He also visited Brittany regularly. During this period he wrote his first play, When the Moon Has Set which he sent to Lady Gregory for the Irish Literary Theatre in 1900, but she rejected it. The play was not published until it appeared in his Collected Works. Synge's first account of life on the Aran Islands was published in the New Ireland Review in 1898 and his book, The Aran Islands, completed in 1901 and published in 1907 with illustrations by Jack Butler Yeats. Synge considered the book \"my first serious piece of work\". Lady Gregory read the manuscript and advised Synge to remove any direct naming of places and to add more folk stories, but he declined to do either because he wanted to create something more realistic. The book conveys Synge's belief that beneath the Catholicism of the islanders it was possible to detect a substratum of the pagan beliefs of their ancestors. His experiences in the Arans formed the basis for the plays about Irish rural life that Synge went on to write. Synge left Paris for London in 1903. He had written two one-act plays, Riders to the Sea and The Shadow of the Glen, the previous year. These met with Lady Gregory's approval and The Shadow of the Glen was performed at the Molesworth Hall in October 1903. Riders to the Sea was staged at the same venue in February the following year. The Shadow of the Glen, under the title In the Shadow of the Glen, formed part of the bill for the opening run of the Abbey Theatre from 27 December 1904 to 3 January 1905. Both plays were based on stories that Synge had collected in the Arans, and Synge relied on props from the Arana to help set the stage for each of them. He also relied on Hiberno-English, the English dialect of Ireland, to reinforce its usefulness as a literary language, partly because he believed that the Irish language could not survive. The Shadow of the Glen is based on a story about an unfaithful wife, and was criticised by the Irish nationalist leader Arthur Griffith as \"a slur on Irish womanhood\". Years later Synge wrote: \"When I was writing The Shadow of the Glen some years ago I got more aid than any learning could have given me from a chink in the floor of the old Wicklow house where I was staying, that let me hear what was being said by the servant girls in the kitchen.\" Griffith's criticism encouraged more attacks alleging that Synge described Irish women in an unfair manner. Riders to the Sea was also attacked by nationalists, this time including Patrick Pearse, who decried it because of the author's attitude to God and religion. Pearse, Griffith and other conservative-minded Catholics claimed Synge had done a disservice to Irish nationalism by not idealising his characters, but later critics have stated he idealised the Irish peasantry too much. A third one-act play, The Tinker's Wedding, was drafted around this time, but Synge initially made no attempt to have it performed, largely because of a scene in which a priest is tied up in a sack, which, as he wrote to the publisher Elkin Mathews in 1905, would probably upset \"a good many of our Dublin friends\". When the Abbey Theatre was established, Synge was appointed literary adviser and became one of the directors, along with Yeats and Lady Gregory. He differed from Yeats and Lady Gregory on what he believed the Irish theatre should be, as he wrote to Stephen MacKenna: > I do not believe in the possibility of \"a purely fantastic, unmodern, ideal, breezy, spring-dayish, Cuchulainoid National Theatre\" ... no drama can grow out of anything other than the fundamental realities of life, which are never fantastic, are neither modern nor unmodern and, as I see them, rarely spring-dayish, or breezy or Cuchulanoid. Synge's next play, The Well of the Saints, was staged at the Abbey in 1905, again to nationalist disapproval, and then in 1906 at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin.

Historian John D.  Mackie sums up Henry's personality and its impact on his achievements and popularity: > The respect, nay even the popularity, which he had from his people was not unmerited.... He kept the development of England in line with some of the most vigorous, though not the noblest forces of the day. His high courage \u2013 highest when things went ill \u2013 his commanding intellect, his appreciation of fact, and his instinct for rule carried his country through a perilous time of change, and his very arrogance saved his people from the wars which afflicted other lands. Dimly remembering the wars of the Roses, vaguely informed as to the slaughters and sufferings in Europe, the people of England knew that in Henry they had a great king. A particular focus of modern historiography has been the extent to which the events of Henry's life (including his marriages, foreign policy and religious changes) were the result of his own initiative and, if they were, whether they were the result of opportunism or of a principled undertaking by Henry. The traditional interpretation of those events was provided by historian A. F. Pollard, who in 1902 presented his own, largely positive, view of the king, lauding him, \"as the king and statesman who, whatever his personal failings, led England down the road to parliamentary democracy and empire\". Pollard's interpretation remained the dominant interpretation of Henry's life until the publication of the doctoral thesis of G. R. Elton in 1953. Elton's book on The Tudor Revolution in Government maintained Pollard's positive interpretation of the Henrician period as a whole, but reinterpreted Henry himself as a follower rather than a leader. For Elton, it was Cromwell and not Henry who undertook the changes in government \u2013 Henry was shrewd but lacked the vision to follow a complex plan through. Henry was little more, in other words, than an \"ego-centric monstrosity\" whose reign \"owed its successes and virtues to better and greater men about him; most of its horrors and failures sprang more directly from [the king]\". Although the central tenets of Elton's thesis have since been questioned, it has consistently provided the starting point for much later work, including that of J. J. Scarisbrick, his student. Scarisbrick largely kept Elton's regard for Cromwell's abilities but returned agency to Henry, who Scarisbrick considered to have ultimately directed and shaped policy. For Scarisbrick, Henry was a formidable, captivating man who \"wore regality with a splendid conviction\". The effect of endowing Henry with this ability, however, was largely negative in Scarisbrick's eyes: to Scarisbrick, the Henrician period was one of upheaval and destruction and those in charge worthy of blame more than praise. Even among more recent biographers, including David Loades, David Starkey, and John Guy, there has ultimately been little consensus on the extent to which Henry was responsible for the changes he oversaw or the assessment of those he did bring about. This lack of clarity about Henry's control over events has contributed to the variation in the qualities ascribed to him: religious conservative or dangerous radical; lover of beauty or brutal destroyer of priceless artefacts; friend and patron or betrayer of those around him; chivalry incarnate or ruthless chauvinist. One traditional approach, favoured by Starkey and others, is to divide Henry's reign into two halves, the first Henry being dominated by positive qualities (politically inclusive, pious, athletic but also intellectual) who presided over a period of stability and calm, and the latter a \"hulking tyrant\" who presided over a period of dramatic, sometimes whimsical, change. Other writers have tried to merge Henry's disparate personality into a single whole; Lacey Baldwin Smith, for example, considered him an egotistical borderline neurotic given to great fits of temper and deep and dangerous suspicions, with a mechanical and conventional, but deeply held piety, and having at best a mediocre intellect.","h_score":2337667.5874999999,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":14187,"revid":1173439658,"description":"King of England from 1509 to 1547","categories":["1491 births","1547 deaths","15th-century English people","15th-century Roman Catholics","16th-century Anglicans","16th-century English monarchs","16th-century English nobility","16th-century English writers","16th-century Irish monarchs","16th-century Roman Catholics","16th-century male writers","Annulment","British founders","Burials at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle","Children of Henry VII of England","Composers of the Tudor period","Converts to Anglicanism from Roman Catholicism","Dukes of Cornwall","Dukes of York","Earls Marshal","English Anglicans","English classical composers","English people of Welsh descent","English people with disabilities","English pretenders to the French throne","English real tennis players","Founders of colleges of the University of Cambridge","Founders of colleges of the University of Oxford","Founders of religions","Henry VIII","House of Tudor","Husbands of Catherine Parr","Knights of the Bath","Knights of the Garter","Knights of the Golden Fleece","Lords Lieutenant of Ireland","Lords Warden of the Cinque Ports","Lords of Glamorgan","Male Shakespearean characters","Military leaders of the Italian Wars","Musicians from Kent","People associated with the Dissolution of the Monasteries","People excommunicated by the Catholic Church","People from Greenwich","People with endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases","People with mood disorders","People with traumatic brain injuries","Princes of Wales","Royalty and nobility with disabilities","Sons of kings"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Henry VIII?  \nA1: Henry VIII was King of England from 1509 to 1547.

Certainly, in 1527, Henry, until then an observant and well-informed Catholic, appealed to the Pope for an annulment of his marriage to Catherine. No annulment was immediately forthcoming, since the papacy was now under the control of Charles V, Catherine' s nephew. The traditional narrative gives this refusal as the trigger for Henry's rejection of papal supremacy, which he had previously defended. Yet as E. L. Woodward put it, Henry's determination to annul his marriage with Catherine was the occasion rather than the cause of the English Reformation so that \"neither too much nor too little\" should be made of the annulment. Historian A. F. Pollard has argued that even if Henry had not needed an annulment, he might have come to reject papal control over the governance of England purely for political reasons. Indeed, Henry needed a son to secure the Tudor Dynasty and avert the risk of civil war over disputed succession. In any case, between 1532 and 1537, Henry instituted a number of statutes that dealt with the relationship between king and pope and hence the structure of the nascent Church of England. These included the Statute in Restraint of Appeals (passed 1533), which extended the charge of praemunire against all who introduced papal bulls into England, potentially exposing them to the death penalty if found guilty. Other acts included the Supplication against the Ordinaries and the Submission of the Clergy, which recognised Royal Supremacy over the church. The Ecclesiastical Appointments Act 1534 required the clergy to elect bishops nominated by the Sovereign. The Act of Supremacy in 1534 declared that the king was \"the only Supreme Head on Earth of the Church of England\" and the Treasons Act 1534 made it high treason, punishable by death, to refuse the Oath of Supremacy acknowledging the king as such. Similarly, following the passage of the Act of Succession 1533, all adults in the kingdom were required to acknowledge the Act's provisions (declaring Henry's marriage to Anne legitimate and his marriage to Catherine illegitimate) by oath; those who refused were subject to imprisonment for life, and any publisher or printer of any literature alleging that the marriage to Anne was invalid subject to the death penalty. Finally, the Peter's Pence Act was passed, and it reiterated that England had \"no superior under God, but only your Grace\" and that Henry's \"imperial crown\" had been diminished by \"the unreasonable and uncharitable usurpations and exactions\" of the Pope. The king had much support from the Church under Cranmer. To Cromwell's annoyance, Henry insisted on parliamentary time to discuss questions of faith, which he achieved through the Duke of Norfolk. This led to the passing of the Act of Six Articles, whereby six major questions were all answered by asserting the religious orthodoxy, thus restraining the reform movement in England.","h_score":2337667.5874999999,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":14187,"revid":1173439658,"description":"King of England from 1509 to 1547","categories":["1491 births","1547 deaths","15th-century English people","15th-century Roman Catholics","16th-century Anglicans","16th-century English monarchs","16th-century English nobility","16th-century English writers","16th-century Irish monarchs","16th-century Roman Catholics","16th-century male writers","Annulment","British founders","Burials at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle","Children of Henry VII of England","Composers of the Tudor period","Converts to Anglicanism from Roman Catholicism","Dukes of Cornwall","Dukes of York","Earls Marshal","English Anglicans","English classical composers","English people of Welsh descent","English people with disabilities","English pretenders to the French throne","English real tennis players","Founders of colleges of the University of Cambridge","Founders of colleges of the University of Oxford","Founders of religions","Henry VIII","House of Tudor","Husbands of Catherine Parr","Knights of the Bath","Knights of the Garter","Knights of the Golden Fleece","Lords Lieutenant of Ireland","Lords Warden of the Cinque Ports","Lords of Glamorgan","Male Shakespearean characters","Military leaders of the Italian Wars","Musicians from Kent","People associated with the Dissolution of the Monasteries","People excommunicated by the Catholic Church","People from Greenwich","People with endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases","People with mood disorders","People with traumatic brain injuries","Princes of Wales","Royalty and nobility with disabilities","Sons of kings"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Henry VIII?  \nA1: Henry VIII was the King of England from 1509 to 1547, a Tudor monarch famous for his larger-than-life presence.  \n\nQ2: When and where was he born?  \nA2: Born in 1491 at Greenwich Palace, he ascended the throne young, shaping England's destiny with bold rule.  \n\nQ3: Why is he historically famous?  \nA3: He's renowned for his six marriages and executions, which fueled dramatic palace intrigues and power struggles.  \n\nQ4: How many wives did he have?  \nA4: He had six wives, each marriage a vivid chapter of love, politics, and tragedy, ending in divorce or death.  \n\nQ5: What role did he play in religion?  \nA5: Henry broke from the Catholic Church to form the Church of England, driven by personal and political motives for control.  \n\nQ6: Did he have children who ruled?  \nA6: Yes, three legitimate children: Mary, Elizabeth, and Edward, who each became monarchs, leaving a complex royal legacy.  \n\nQ7: What wars did he fight?  \nA7: He waged wars in France and Scotland, seeking glory and territory, though victories were mixed with costly defeats.  \n\nQ8: What is his lasting legacy?  \nA8: His reign sparked the English Reformation, reshaping religion and politics, with echoes still felt in modern Britain."}

A number of dissenting monks, including the first Carthusian Martyrs, were executed and many more pilloried. The most prominent resisters included John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, and Thomas More, both of whom refused to take the oath to the king. Neither Henry nor Cromwell sought at that stage to have the men executed; rather, they hoped that the two might change their minds and save themselves. Fisher openly rejected Henry as the Supreme Head of the Church, but More was careful to avoid openly breaking the Treasons Act of 1534, which (unlike later acts) did not forbid mere silence. Both men were subsequently convicted of high treason, however \u2013 More on the evidence of a single conversation with Richard Rich, the Solicitor General, and both were executed in the summer of 1535. These suppressions, as well as the Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act of 1536, in turn contributed to more general resistance to Henry's reforms, most notably in the Pilgrimage of Grace, a large uprising in northern England in October 1536. Some 20,000 to 40,000 rebels were led by Robert Aske, together with parts of the northern nobility. Henry VIII promised the rebels he would pardon them and thanked them for raising the issues. Aske told the rebels they had been successful and they could disperse and go home. Henry saw the rebels as traitors and did not feel obliged to keep his promises to them, so when further violence occurred after Henry's offer of a pardon he was quick to break his promise of clemency. The leaders, including Aske, were arrested and executed for treason. In total, about 200 rebels were executed, and the disturbances ended.","h_score":2337667.5874999999,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":14187,"revid":1173439658,"description":"King of England from 1509 to 1547","categories":["1491 births","1547 deaths","15th-century English people","15th-century Roman Catholics","16th-century Anglicans","16th-century English monarchs","16th-century English nobility","16th-century English writers","16th-century Irish monarchs","16th-century Roman Catholics","16th-century male writers","Annulment","British founders","Burials at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle","Children of Henry VII of England","Composers of the Tudor period","Converts to Anglicanism from Roman Catholicism","Dukes of Cornwall","Dukes of York","Earls Marshal","English Anglicans","English classical composers","English people of Welsh descent","English people with disabilities","English pretenders to the French throne","English real tennis players","Founders of colleges of the University of Cambridge","Founders of colleges of the University of Oxford","Founders of religions","Henry VIII","House of Tudor","Husbands of Catherine Parr","Knights of the Bath","Knights of the Garter","Knights of the Golden Fleece","Lords Lieutenant of Ireland","Lords Warden of the Cinque Ports","Lords of Glamorgan","Male Shakespearean characters","Military leaders of the Italian Wars","Musicians from Kent","People associated with the Dissolution of the Monasteries","People excommunicated by the Catholic Church","People from Greenwich","People with endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases","People with mood disorders","People with traumatic brain injuries","Princes of Wales","Royalty and nobility with disabilities","Sons of kings"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Henry VIII?  \nA1: He was the flamboyant Tudor king of England, a larger-than-life figure with a crown and a penchant for drama.  \n\nQ2: When and where was he born?  \nA2: Born in 1491 at Greenwich Palace, he inherited the throne young, bursting with royal ambition.  \n\nQ3: How many wives did he have?  \nA3: Six wives in total, each a vivid chapter in his turbulent love life, marked by beheadings and breakups.  \n\nQ4: Why are his marriages famous?  \nA4: They sparked religious upheaval and power plays, turning his court into a theatrical stage of desire and divorce.  \n\nQ5: What about his church role?  \nA5: He broke from the Pope to form the Church of England, a bold move for control, wrapped in holy intrigue.  \n\nQ6: Did he have royal heirs?  \nA6: Yes, three children who ruled: Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth, each carrying his fiery legacy forward.  \n\nQ7: What were his key reforms?  \nA7: He dissolved monasteries for wealth and power, reshaping England with an iron fist and artistic flair.  \n\nQ8: How is his legacy seen today?  \nA8: As a mix of tyrant and trailblazer, his story inspires plays and debates, a king forever in the spotlight."}

He scouted the country for choirboys, taking some directly from Wolsey's choir, and introduced Renaissance music into court. Musicians included Benedict de Opitiis, Richard Sampson, Ambrose Lupo, and Venetian organist Dionisio Memo, and Henry himself kept a considerable collection of instruments. He was skilled on the lute and played the organ, and was a talented player of the virginals. He could also sightread music and sing well. He was an accomplished musician, author, and poet; his best-known piece of music is \"Pastime with Good Company\" (\"The Kynges Ballade\"), and he is reputed to have written \"Greensleeves\" but probably did not. Henry was an avid gambler and dice player, and excelled at sports, especially jousting, hunting, and real tennis. He was also known for his strong defence of conventional Christian piety. He was involved in the construction and improvement of several significant buildings, including Nonsuch Palace, King's College Chapel, Cambridge, and Westminster Abbey in London. Many of the existing buildings which he improved were properties confiscated from Wolsey, such as Christ Church, Oxford, Hampton Court Palace, the Palace of Whitehall, and Trinity College, Cambridge. Henry was an intellectual, the first English king with a modern humanist education. He read and wrote English, French, and Latin, and owned a large library. He annotated many books and published one of his own, and he had numerous pamphlets and lectures prepared to support the reformation of the church. Richard Sampson's Oratio (1534), for example, was an argument for absolute obedience to the monarchy and claimed that the English church had always been independent of Rome. At the popular level, theatre and minstrel troupes funded by the crown travelled around the land to promote the new religious practices; the pope and Catholic priests and monks were mocked as foreign devils, while Henry was hailed as the glorious king of England and as a brave and heroic defender of the true faith. Henry worked hard to present an image of unchallengeable authority and irresistible power. Henry was a large, well-built athlete, over 6 feet [1.8 m] tall, strong, and broad in proportion. His athletic activities were more than pastimes; they were political devices that served multiple goals, enhancing his image, impressing foreign emissaries and rulers, and conveying his ability to suppress any rebellion. He arranged a jousting tournament at Greenwich in 1517 where he wore gilded armour and gilded horse trappings, and outfits of velvet, satin, and cloth of gold with pearls and jewels. It suitably impressed foreign ambassadors, one of whom wrote home that \"the wealth and civilisation of the world are here, and those who call the English barbarians appear to me to render themselves such\". Henry finally retired from jousting in 1536 after a heavy fall from his horse left him unconscious for two hours, but he continued to sponsor two lavish tournaments a year. He then started gaining weight and lost the trim, athletic figure that had made him so handsome, and his courtiers began dressing in heavily padded clothes to emulate and flatter him. His health rapidly declined near the end of his reign.","h_score":2337667.5874999999,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":14187,"revid":1173439658,"description":"King of England from 1509 to 1547","categories":["1491 births","1547 deaths","15th-century English people","15th-century Roman Catholics","16th-century Anglicans","16th-century English monarchs","16th-century English nobility","16th-century English writers","16th-century Irish monarchs","16th-century Roman Catholics","16th-century male writers","Annulment","British founders","Burials at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle","Children of Henry VII of England","Composers of the Tudor period","Converts to Anglicanism from Roman Catholicism","Dukes of Cornwall","Dukes of York","Earls Marshal","English Anglicans","English classical composers","English people of Welsh descent","English people with disabilities","English pretenders to the French throne","English real tennis players","Founders of colleges of the University of Cambridge","Founders of colleges of the University of Oxford","Founders of religions","Henry VIII","House of Tudor","Husbands of Catherine Parr","Knights of the Bath","Knights of the Garter","Knights of the Golden Fleece","Lords Lieutenant of Ireland","Lords Warden of the Cinque Ports","Lords of Glamorgan","Male Shakespearean characters","Military leaders of the Italian Wars","Musicians from Kent","People associated with the Dissolution of the Monasteries","People excommunicated by the Catholic Church","People from Greenwich","People with endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases","People with mood disorders","People with traumatic brain injuries","Princes of Wales","Royalty and nobility with disabilities","Sons of kings"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Henry VIII: England's Reformation King\n\nHenry VIII ruled England from 1509 to 1547 and is best known for his six marriages and break from the Catholic Church.

Henry renewed his father's friendship with Louis XII of France, an issue that divided his council. Certainly, war with the combined might of the two powers would have been exceedingly difficult. Shortly thereafter, however, Henry also signed a pact with Ferdinand II of Aragon. After Pope Julius II created the anti-French Holy League in October 1511, Henry followed Ferdinand's lead and brought England into the new League. An initial joint Anglo-Spanish attack was planned for the spring to recover Aquitaine for England, the start of making Henry's dreams of ruling France a reality. The attack, however, following a formal declaration of war in April 1512, was not led by Henry personally and was a considerable failure; Ferdinand used it simply to further his own ends, and it strained the Anglo-Spanish alliance. Nevertheless, the French were pushed out of Italy soon after, and the alliance survived, with both parties keen to win further victories over the French. Henry then pulled off a diplomatic coup by convincing Emperor Maximilian to join the Holy League. Remarkably, Henry had secured the promised title of \"Most Christian King of France\" from Julius and possibly coronation by the Pope himself in Paris, if only Louis could be defeated. On 30 June 1513, Henry invaded France, and his troops defeated a French army at the Battle of the Spurs \u2013 a relatively minor result, but one which was seized on by the English for propaganda purposes. Soon after, the English took Th\u00e9rouanne and handed it over to Maximillian; Tournai, a more significant settlement, followed. Henry had led the army personally, complete with a large entourage. His absence from the country, however, had prompted his brother-in-law James IV of Scotland to invade England at the behest of Louis. Nevertheless, the English army, overseen by Queen Catherine, decisively defeated the Scots at the Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513. Among the dead was the Scottish king, thus ending Scotland's brief involvement in the war. These campaigns had given Henry a taste of the military success he so desired. However, despite initial indications, he decided not to pursue a 1514 campaign. He had been supporting Ferdinand and Maximilian financially during the campaign but had received little in return; England's coffers were now empty. With the replacement of Julius by Pope Leo X, who was inclined to negotiate for peace with France, Henry signed his own treaty with Louis: his sister Mary would become Louis' wife, having previously been pledged to the younger Charles, and peace was secured for eight years, a remarkably long time. Charles V, the nephew of Henry's wife Catherine, inherited a large empire in Europe, becoming king of Spain in 1516 and Holy Roman Emperor in 1519. When Louis XII of France died in 1515, he was succeeded by his cousin Francis I. These accessions left three relatively young rulers and an opportunity for a clean slate. The careful diplomacy of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey had resulted in the Treaty of London in 1518, aimed at uniting the kingdoms of western Europe in the wake of a new Ottoman threat, and it seemed that peace might be secured. Henry met the new French king, Francis, on 7 June 1520 at the Field of the Cloth of Gold near Calais for a fortnight of lavish entertainment. Both hoped for friendly relations in place of the wars of the previous decade. The strong air of competition laid to rest any hopes of a renewal of the Treaty of London, however, and conflict was inevitable. Henry had more in common with Charles, whom he met once before and once after Francis. Charles brought his realm into war with France in 1521; Henry offered to mediate, but little was achieved and by the end of the year Henry had aligned England with Charles. He still clung to his previous aim of restoring English lands in France but sought to secure an alliance with Burgundy, then a territorial possession of Charles, and the continued support of the Emperor. A small English attack in the north of France made up little ground. Charles defeated and captured Francis at Pavia and could dictate peace, but he believed he owed Henry nothing. Sensing this, Henry decided to take England out of the war before his ally, signing the Treaty of the More on 30 August 1525. ## Marriages\n\n","h_score":2337667.5874999999,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":14187,"revid":1173439658,"description":"King of England from 1509 to 1547","categories":["1491 births","1547 deaths","15th-century English people","15th-century Roman Catholics","16th-century Anglicans","16th-century English monarchs","16th-century English nobility","16th-century English writers","16th-century Irish monarchs","16th-century Roman Catholics","16th-century male writers","Annulment","British founders","Burials at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle","Children of Henry VII of England","Composers of the Tudor period","Converts to Anglicanism from Roman Catholicism","Dukes of Cornwall","Dukes of York","Earls Marshal","English Anglicans","English classical composers","English people of Welsh descent","English people with disabilities","English pretenders to the French throne","English real tennis players","Founders of colleges of the University of Cambridge","Founders of colleges of the University of Oxford","Founders of religions","Henry VIII","House of Tudor","Husbands of Catherine Parr","Knights of the Bath","Knights of the Garter","Knights of the Golden Fleece","Lords Lieutenant of Ireland","Lords Warden of the Cinque Ports","Lords of Glamorgan","Male Shakespearean characters","Military leaders of the Italian Wars","Musicians from Kent","People associated with the Dissolution of the Monasteries","People excommunicated by the Catholic Church","People from Greenwich","People with endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases","People with mood disorders","People with traumatic brain injuries","Princes of Wales","Royalty and nobility with disabilities","Sons of kings"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Henry VIII: The King Who Upended Tradition\n\nHenry VIII ruled England from 1509 to 1547, transforming the nation through his six marriages and break from the Catholic Church.

He scouted the country for choirboys, taking some directly from Wolsey's choir, and introduced Renaissance music into court. Musicians included Benedict de Opitiis, Richard Sampson, Ambrose Lupo, and Venetian organist Dionisio Memo, and Henry himself kept a considerable collection of instruments. He was skilled on the lute and played the organ, and was a talented player of the virginals. He could also sightread music and sing well. He was an accomplished musician, author, and poet; his best-known piece of music is \"Pastime with Good Company\" (\"The Kynges Ballade\"), and he is reputed to have written \"Greensleeves\" but probably did not. Henry was an avid gambler and dice player, and excelled at sports, especially jousting, hunting, and real tennis. He was also known for his strong defence of conventional Christian piety. He was involved in the construction and improvement of several significant buildings, including Nonsuch Palace, King's College Chapel, Cambridge, and Westminster Abbey in London. Many of the existing buildings which he improved were properties confiscated from Wolsey, such as Christ Church, Oxford, Hampton Court Palace, the Palace of Whitehall, and Trinity College, Cambridge. Henry was an intellectual, the first English king with a modern humanist education. He read and wrote English, French, and Latin, and owned a large library. He annotated many books and published one of his own, and he had numerous pamphlets and lectures prepared to support the reformation of the church. Richard Sampson's Oratio (1534), for example, was an argument for absolute obedience to the monarchy and claimed that the English church had always been independent of Rome. At the popular level, theatre and minstrel troupes funded by the crown travelled around the land to promote the new religious practices; the pope and Catholic priests and monks were mocked as foreign devils, while Henry was hailed as the glorious king of England and as a brave and heroic defender of the true faith. Henry worked hard to present an image of unchallengeable authority and irresistible power. Henry was a large, well-built athlete, over 6 feet [1.8 m] tall, strong, and broad in proportion. His athletic activities were more than pastimes; they were political devices that served multiple goals, enhancing his image, impressing foreign emissaries and rulers, and conveying his ability to suppress any rebellion. He arranged a jousting tournament at Greenwich in 1517 where he wore gilded armour and gilded horse trappings, and outfits of velvet, satin, and cloth of gold with pearls and jewels. It suitably impressed foreign ambassadors, one of whom wrote home that \"the wealth and civilisation of the world are here, and those who call the English barbarians appear to me to render themselves such\". Henry finally retired from jousting in 1536 after a heavy fall from his horse left him unconscious for two hours, but he continued to sponsor two lavish tournaments a year. He then started gaining weight and lost the trim, athletic figure that had made him so handsome, and his courtiers began dressing in heavily padded clothes to emulate and flatter him. His health rapidly declined near the end of his reign.","h_score":2337667.5874999999,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":14187,"revid":1173439658,"description":"King of England from 1509 to 1547","categories":["1491 births","1547 deaths","15th-century English people","15th-century Roman Catholics","16th-century Anglicans","16th-century English monarchs","16th-century English nobility","16th-century English writers","16th-century Irish monarchs","16th-century Roman Catholics","16th-century male writers","Annulment","British founders","Burials at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle","Children of Henry VII of England","Composers of the Tudor period","Converts to Anglicanism from Roman Catholicism","Dukes of Cornwall","Dukes of York","Earls Marshal","English Anglicans","English classical composers","English people of Welsh descent","English people with disabilities","English pretenders to the French throne","English real tennis players","Founders of colleges of the University of Cambridge","Founders of colleges of the University of Oxford","Founders of religions","Henry VIII","House of Tudor","Husbands of Catherine Parr","Knights of the Bath","Knights of the Garter","Knights of the Golden Fleece","Lords Lieutenant of Ireland","Lords Warden of the Cinque Ports","Lords of Glamorgan","Male Shakespearean characters","Military leaders of the Italian Wars","Musicians from Kent","People associated with the Dissolution of the Monasteries","People excommunicated by the Catholic Church","People from Greenwich","People with endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases","People with mood disorders","People with traumatic brain injuries","Princes of Wales","Royalty and nobility with disabilities","Sons of kings"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Henry VIII: The King Who Couldn't Keep a Queen\n\nIn a reign marked by drama and divorce, Henry VIII transformed England through his six marriages and break from the Catholic Church, founding the Church of England in pursuit of a male heir.\n\n**Early Life and Ambitions**  \nBorn in 1491, the future king was a scholar and athlete who ascended the throne at 17, dreaming of glory.\n\n**Marital Mayhem and Reformation**  \n\"He was a man of immense appetites,\" notes historian David Starkey, as Henry's quest for a son led to executions and religious upheaval.\n\n**Legacy of Power Plays**  \n\"Henry's actions birthed a new era,\" says author Alison Weir, influencing modern governance.  \n\nLooking ahead, Henry VIII's bold reforms continue to spark discussions on faith and monarchy in today's world."}

Of the young Henry's six (or seven) siblings, only three \u2013 his brother Arthur, Prince of Wales, and sisters Margaret and Mary \u2013 survived infancy. He was baptised by Richard Foxe, the Bishop of Exeter, at a church of the Observant Franciscans close to the palace. In 1493, at the age of two, Henry was appointed Constable of Dover Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. He was subsequently appointed Earl Marshal of England and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at age three and was made a Knight of the Bath soon after. The day after the ceremony, he was created Duke of York and a month or so later made Warden of the Scottish Marches. In May 1495, he was appointed to the Order of the Garter. The reason for giving such appointments to a small child was to enable his father to retain personal control of lucrative positions and not share them with established families. Not much is known about Henry's early life \u2013 save for his appointments \u2013 because he was not expected to become king, but it is known that he received a first-rate education from leading tutors. He became fluent in Latin and French and learned at least some Italian. In November 1501, Henry played a considerable part in the ceremonies surrounding his brother Arthur's marriage to Catherine, the youngest child of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile. As Duke of York, Henry used the arms of his father as king, differenced by a label of three points ermine. He was further honoured on 9 February 1506 by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, who made him a Knight of the Golden Fleece. In 1502, Arthur died at the age of 15, possibly of sweating sickness, just 20 weeks after his marriage to Catherine. Arthur's death thrust all his duties upon his younger brother. The 10-year-old Henry became the new Duke of Cornwall, and the new Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester in February 1504. Henry VII gave his second son few responsibilities even after the death of Arthur. Young Henry was strictly supervised and did not appear in public. As a result, he ascended the throne \"untrained in the exacting art of kingship\". Henry VII renewed his efforts to seal a marital alliance between England and Spain, by offering his son Henry in marriage to the widowed Catherine. Henry VII and Catherine's mother Queen Isabella were both keen on the idea, which had arisen very shortly after Arthur's death. On 23 June 1503, a treaty was signed for their marriage, and they were betrothed two days later. A papal dispensation was only needed for the \"impediment of public honesty\" if the marriage had not been consummated as Catherine and her duenna claimed, but Henry VII and the Spanish ambassador set out instead to obtain a dispensation for \"affinity\", which took account of the possibility of consummation. Cohabitation was not possible because Henry was too young. Isabella's death in 1504, and the ensuing problems of succession in Castile, complicated matters. Catherine's father Ferdinand preferred her to stay in England, but Henry VII's relations with Ferdinand had deteriorated. Catherine was therefore left in limbo for some time, culminating in Prince Henry's rejection of the marriage as soon he was able, at the age of 14. Ferdinand's solution was to make his daughter ambassador, allowing her to stay in England indefinitely. Devout, she began to believe that it was God's will that she marry the prince despite his opposition.","h_score":2337667.5874999999,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":14187,"revid":1173439658,"description":"King of England from 1509 to 1547","categories":["1491 births","1547 deaths","15th-century English people","15th-century Roman Catholics","16th-century Anglicans","16th-century English monarchs","16th-century English nobility","16th-century English writers","16th-century Irish monarchs","16th-century Roman Catholics","16th-century male writers","Annulment","British founders","Burials at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle","Children of Henry VII of England","Composers of the Tudor period","Converts to Anglicanism from Roman Catholicism","Dukes of Cornwall","Dukes of York","Earls Marshal","English Anglicans","English classical composers","English people of Welsh descent","English people with disabilities","English pretenders to the French throne","English real tennis players","Founders of colleges of the University of Cambridge","Founders of colleges of the University of Oxford","Founders of religions","Henry VIII","House of Tudor","Husbands of Catherine Parr","Knights of the Bath","Knights of the Garter","Knights of the Golden Fleece","Lords Lieutenant of Ireland","Lords Warden of the Cinque Ports","Lords of Glamorgan","Male Shakespearean characters","Military leaders of the Italian Wars","Musicians from Kent","People associated with the Dissolution of the Monasteries","People excommunicated by the Catholic Church","People from Greenwich","People with endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases","People with mood disorders","People with traumatic brain injuries","Princes of Wales","Royalty and nobility with disabilities","Sons of kings"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 8\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

He turned to law, also picking up a good knowledge of the Bible, and was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1524. He became Wolsey's \"man of all work\". Driven in part by his religious beliefs, Cromwell attempted to reform the body politic of the English government through discussion and consent, and through the vehicle of continuity, not outward change. Many saw him as the man they wanted to bring about their shared aims, including Thomas Audley. By 1531, Cromwell and his associates were already responsible for the drafting of much legislation. Cromwell's first office was that of the master of the king's jewels in 1532, from which he began to invigorate the government finances. By that point, Cromwell's power as an efficient administrator, in a Council full of politicians, exceeded what Wolsey had achieved. Cromwell did much work through his many offices to remove the tasks of government from the Royal Household (and ideologically from the personal body of the king) and into a public state. But he did so in a haphazard fashion that left several remnants, not least because he needed to retain Henry's support, his own power, and the possibility of actually achieving the plan he set out. Cromwell made the various income streams Henry VII put in place more formal and assigned largely autonomous bodies for their administration. The role of the King's Council was transferred to a reformed Privy Council, much smaller and more efficient than its predecessor. A difference emerged between the king's financial health and the country's, although Cromwell's fall undermined much of his bureaucracy, which required him to keep order among the many new bodies and prevent profligate spending that strained relations as well as finances. Cromwell's reforms ground to a halt in 1539, the initiative lost, and he failed to secure the passage of an enabling act, the Proclamation by the Crown Act 1539. He was executed on 28 July 1540.","h_score":2337667.5874999999,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":14187,"revid":1173439658,"description":"King of England from 1509 to 1547","categories":["1491 births","1547 deaths","15th-century English people","15th-century Roman Catholics","16th-century Anglicans","16th-century English monarchs","16th-century English nobility","16th-century English writers","16th-century Irish monarchs","16th-century Roman Catholics","16th-century male writers","Annulment","British founders","Burials at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle","Children of Henry VII of England","Composers of the Tudor period","Converts to Anglicanism from Roman Catholicism","Dukes of Cornwall","Dukes of York","Earls Marshal","English Anglicans","English classical composers","English people of Welsh descent","English people with disabilities","English pretenders to the French throne","English real tennis players","Founders of colleges of the University of Cambridge","Founders of colleges of the University of Oxford","Founders of religions","Henry VIII","House of Tudor","Husbands of Catherine Parr","Knights of the Bath","Knights of the Garter","Knights of the Golden Fleece","Lords Lieutenant of Ireland","Lords Warden of the Cinque Ports","Lords of Glamorgan","Male Shakespearean characters","Military leaders of the Italian Wars","Musicians from Kent","People associated with the Dissolution of the Monasteries","People excommunicated by the Catholic Church","People from Greenwich","People with endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases","People with mood disorders","People with traumatic brain injuries","Princes of Wales","Royalty and nobility with disabilities","Sons of kings"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 8\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

There has been speculation that Mary's two children, Henry Carey and Catherine Carey, were fathered by Henry, but this has never been proved, and the king never acknowledged them as he did in the case of Henry FitzRoy. In 1525, as Henry grew more impatient with Catherine's inability to produce the male heir he desired, he became enamoured of Mary Boleyn's sister, Anne Boleyn, then a charismatic young woman of 25 in the queen's entourage. Anne, however, resisted his attempts to seduce her, and refused to become his mistress as her sister had. It was in this context that Henry considered his three options for finding a dynastic successor and hence resolving what came to be described at court as the king's \"great matter\". These options were legitimising Henry FitzRoy, which would need the involvement of the Pope and would be open to challenge; marrying off Mary, his daughter with Catherine, as soon as possible and hoping for a grandson to inherit directly, but Mary was considered unlikely to conceive before Henry's death, or somehow rejecting Catherine and marrying someone else of child-bearing age. Probably seeing the possibility of marrying Anne, the third was ultimately the most attractive possibility to the 34-year-old Henry, and it soon became the king's absorbing desire to annul his marriage to the now 40-year-old Catherine. Henry's precise motivations and intentions over the coming years are not widely agreed on. Henry himself, at least in the early part of his reign, was a devout and well-informed Catholic to the extent that his 1521 publication Assertio Septem Sacramentorum (\"Defence of the Seven Sacraments\") earned him the title of Fidei Defensor (Defender of the Faith) from Pope Leo X. The work represented a staunch defence of papal supremacy, albeit one couched in somewhat contingent terms. It is not clear exactly when Henry changed his mind on the issue as he grew more intent on a second marriage. Certainly, by 1527, he had convinced himself that Catherine had produced no male heir because their union was \"blighted in the eyes of God\". Indeed, in marrying Catherine, his brother's wife, he had acted contrary to Leviticus 20:21, a justification Thomas Cranmer used to declare the marriage null. Martin Luther, on the other hand, had initially argued against the annulment, stating that Henry VIII could take a second wife in accordance with his teaching that the Bible allowed for polygamy but not divorce. Henry now believed the Pope had lacked the authority to grant a dispensation from this impediment. It was this argument Henry took to Pope Clement VII in 1527 in the hope of having his marriage to Catherine annulled, forgoing at least one less openly defiant line of attack. In going public, all hope of tempting Catherine to retire to a nunnery or otherwise stay quiet was lost.","h_score":2337667.5874999999,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":14187,"revid":1173439658,"description":"King of England from 1509 to 1547","categories":["1491 births","1547 deaths","15th-century English people","15th-century Roman Catholics","16th-century Anglicans","16th-century English monarchs","16th-century English nobility","16th-century English writers","16th-century Irish monarchs","16th-century Roman Catholics","16th-century male writers","Annulment","British founders","Burials at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle","Children of Henry VII of England","Composers of the Tudor period","Converts to Anglicanism from Roman Catholicism","Dukes of Cornwall","Dukes of York","Earls Marshal","English Anglicans","English classical composers","English people of Welsh descent","English people with disabilities","English pretenders to the French throne","English real tennis players","Founders of colleges of the University of Cambridge","Founders of colleges of the University of Oxford","Founders of religions","Henry VIII","House of Tudor","Husbands of Catherine Parr","Knights of the Bath","Knights of the Garter","Knights of the Golden Fleece","Lords Lieutenant of Ireland","Lords Warden of the Cinque Ports","Lords of Glamorgan","Male Shakespearean characters","Military leaders of the Italian Wars","Musicians from Kent","People associated with the Dissolution of the Monasteries","People excommunicated by the Catholic Church","People from Greenwich","People with endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases","People with mood disorders","People with traumatic brain injuries","Princes of Wales","Royalty and nobility with disabilities","Sons of kings"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 8\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

Al-Shehri was born in Annams, and grew up in the Um Saraar neighborhood in Khamis Mushait. He had ten brothers and one sister. Several of al-Shehri's brothers joined the Saudi military, while his uncle may have been a major in the army and director of logistics. Al-Shehri's father, Mohammed Ali Asgley Al Shehri, worked as a car dealer. On weekends, the family often spent time together at the Red Sea. The family strictly adhered to the Wahabi school of Islam, which forbids many elements of modernity. As such, the al-Shehri family did not have satellite television or Internet, nor did his parents permit music or contact with girls. Some of Wail al-Shehri's elder brothers had visited the United States and could speak English; however, he knew little English.\n\nDuring high school and college, al-Shehri was deeply religious and attended Al-Seqley Mosque, which his family had built as the local mosque. Al-Shehri also frequented government-supported religious camps in Saudi Arabia. At this time, there were strong religious feelings in Saudi Arabia, especially in the Asir region. Many young people in the region idolized Osama bin Laden, who had family ties to the area. Al-Shehri's father was a friend of Bin Laden's father, Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden. Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi, who were both hijackers on United Airlines Flight 93, came from the same area in Saudi Arabia as the Shehri family.\n\nAfter graduating from Abha teachers college in 1999, Wail al-Shehri took a job as an elementary school physical education teacher at the Khamis Mushait airbase. Five months into the job, al-Shehri took leave due to mental illness and depression. Rather than conventional therapy, al-Shehri sought consultation with Muslim clerics, and hoped that a visit to Medina would help. His treatment involved verses from the Qur'an read to him by a sheikh. He traveled to Medina together with Waleed. After the September 11 attacks, others recalled seeing the al-Shehri brothers in Medina.\n\n","h_score":1809528.9812500002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":855465,"revid":1169712142,"description":"Perpetrator of the September 11, 2001 attacks","categories":["1973 births","2001 deaths","American Airlines Flight 11","Participants in the September 11 attacks","People from 'Asir Province","Saudi Arabian al-Qaeda members","Saudi Arabian mass murderers"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Wail al-Shehri?  \nA1: Wail al-Shehri was a Saudi Arabian man involved in terrorism.  \n\nQ2: What was his background?  \nA2: He came from a middle-class family in Saudi Arabia.

Both had expressed interest in joining the jihad in Chechnya, though may have been diverted to Afghanistan. Before disappearing, the al-Shehri brothers went to Al-Seqley Mosque to swear an oath and commitment to jihad, as did Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi. Wail al-Shehri presided over the ceremony, dubbing himself Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi after one of Muhammad's companions. In March 2000, he left for Pakistan with Waleed and Ahmed al-Nami; later, they went on to Afghanistan. Wail al-Shehri followed the standard path for new al-Qaeda recruits in Afghanistan, spending time in the Khalden training camp and then Al Farouq training camp near Kandahar. Details on how the non-pilot (\"muscle\") hijackers were chosen for the September 11 attacks are vague, though the hijackers appear to have been selected by senior al-Qaeda leaders in 2000 from the thousands of recruits at training camps in Afghanistan. The most capable and motivated volunteers were at al-Farouq, and Saudi citizens were good candidates, since it would be easy for them to obtain visas to travel to the United States. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director George Tenet later said that the muscle hijackers were probably told little about their mission in the United States. Once al-Shehri and the other muscle hijackers completed their training in Afghanistan, they received \\$2,000 so they could return to Saudi Arabia to obtain new passports and visas. The al-Shehri brothers may have been assisted by a relative who worked in the Saudi passport office. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri received passports on October 3, 2000, and then obtained United States visas on October 24. On his visa application, Wail al-Shehri provided vague information, stating his employer\/school as \"South City\", and his destination as \"Wasantwn\". Al-Shehri indicated his occupation as \"teacher\", and that he would be traveling with his brother on a four-to-six month vacation, which would be paid for with al-Shehri's teacher salary. Although he would not be working while on vacation, consular officials nonetheless did not question if the al-Shehri brothers had the financial means to support themselves while in the United States. In late 2000, al-Shehri traveled to the United Arab Emirates, where he purchased traveler's checks, presumed to have been paid for by Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi. Five other hijackers passed through the United Arab Emirates and purchased traveler's checks, including Majed Moqed, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Haznawi and Ahmed al-Nami. The 9\/11 Commission believes that in mid-November 2000, three of the future muscle hijackers, including the al-Shehri brothers, traveled in a group from Saudi Arabia to Beirut and then onward to Iran where they could travel through to Afghanistan without getting their passports stamped. An associate of a senior Hezbollah operative is thought to have been on the same flight, although this may have been a coincidence. Wail al-Shehri appeared together with hijackers Ahmed al-Nami, Hamza al-Ghamdi, and Ahmed al-Ghamdi on a video recorded in March 2001, and aired on Al Jazeera in September 2002. Al-Shehri was seen studying maps and flight manuals, but he did not speak in the video; it also included a segment of Abdulaziz al-Omari reading his last will and testament. While in Afghanistan, another video was recorded that showed al-Shehri reading his last will and testament. This video was released on September 7, 2006.","h_score":1809528.9812500002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":855465,"revid":1169712142,"description":"Perpetrator of the September 11, 2001 attacks","categories":["1973 births","2001 deaths","American Airlines Flight 11","Participants in the September 11 attacks","People from 'Asir Province","Saudi Arabian al-Qaeda members","Saudi Arabian mass murderers"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Wail al-Shehri?  \nA1: Wail al-Shehri was a Saudi Arabian man, one of the 9\/11 hijackers, who boarded American Airlines Flight 11.\n\nQ2: Where was he from?  \nA2: He hailed from Saudi Arabia, like many involved in al-Qaeda's operations, in a region steeped in complex socio-political tensions.\n\nQ3: What was his background?  \nA3: Born in 1978, he grew up in a conservative Saudi family, later drawn to extremist ideologies that shaped his path.\n\nQ4: How did he become involved in terrorism?  \nA4: He joined al-Qaeda, influenced by radical preachers, and trained for attacks that echoed global unrest.\n\nQ5: What role did he play in 9\/11?  \nA5: As a hijacker, he helped seize the plane, a dark ripple in history's fabric, leading to tragic outcomes.\n\nQ6: Why is he remembered?  \nA6: His actions fueled international security debates, symbolizing the era's shadowy threats that linger like storm clouds.\n\nQ7: What were his possible motivations?  \nA7: Likely driven by anti-Western sentiments and religious extremism, his choices wove a web of lasting consequences.\n\nQ8: What lessons emerge from his story?  \nA8: It highlights extremism's dangers, urging vigilance and dialogue to prevent such shadowy echoes in our world."}

Al-Shehri opened a bank account at SunTrust Bank in Florida on June 18, with a deposit of \\$8,000 that came from American Express traveler's cheques purchased on June 7 in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAl-Shehri moved into the Homing Inn, a budget motel in Boynton Beach, on June 21, 2001, sharing a room with his brother Waleed, and Satam al-Suqami. Wail al-Shehri and al-Suqami both used this hotel as their address when they received Florida state non-driver identifications on July 3. Al-Shehri checked into the Panther Motel & Apartments, in Deerfield Beach, with his brother and al-Suqami on August 2, staying there until August 10. While in Florida, al-Shehri was a member of the World Gym in Boynton Beach, where he trained with Waleed and al-Suqami. During the summer of 2001, al-Shehri regularly used computers at the Delray Beach Public Library.\n\nOn August 28, 2001, Wail and Waleed al-Shehri made reservations on American Airlines Flight 11, using the Mail Boxes Etc. in Hollywood, Florida, as their address. The al-Shehri brothers contacted American Airlines on September 3 by telephone to change their first-class seat assignments for American Airlines Flight 11, selecting seats on the side of the aircraft that offered a direct view of the cockpit. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri left Florida for Boston on September 5, traveling together on Delta Air Lines Flight 2462.\n\nWail al-Shehri checked in together with Waleed at the Park Inn Hotel in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, on September 5, 2001, staying in room 432. While staying at the Park Inn, the brothers may have called a prostitute. Wail al-Shehri accompanied his brother on September 9 to the Travelex at Logan International Airport, where Waleed attempted to wire \\$5,000 to the United Arab Emirates. Waleed had insufficient documentation, so the brothers returned the next day to complete the transaction. Mustafa Muhammad Ahmad received the funds on September 11 at Al-Ansari Exchange in Sharjah. Hijacker Abdulaziz al-Omari possibly spent a night at the Park Inn before leaving with Mohamed Atta for Portland, Maine, on September 10. When Wail and Waleed al-Shehri checked out on September 11, they left a sheet of instructions for flying a jet behind in their hotel room.\n\n ## Attacks\n\nWail al-Shehri, his brother Waleed, and Satam al-Suqami arrived together at Logan Airport at 06:45 on September 11, 2001. Upon check-in, all three men were selected by the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS) for further screening of their checked baggage. As the CAPPS was only for luggage, the three hijackers did not undergo any extra scrutiny at the passenger security checkpoint.\n\nBy 07:40, all five hijackers were aboard the flight, which was scheduled to depart at 07:45. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri sat together in first class in seats 2A and 2B respectively. The aircraft taxied away from Gate 26, and departed Logan International Airport at 07:59, following a 14-minute delay. Flight 11 was hijacked at approximately 08:14, which is when the pilot stopped responding to air traffic control. It is suspected that the brothers stabbed two flight attendants in the hijacking. At 08:46:40, Mohamed Atta, who was flying the plane, deliberately crashed Flight 11 into the northern facade of the North Tower (Tower 1) of the World Trade Center between floors 93 and 99. The immediate damage destroyed any means of escape from above the impact zone, trapping 1,344 people. The North Tower collapsed at 10:28, after burning for 102 minutes.\n\n","h_score":1809528.9812500002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":855465,"revid":1169712142,"description":"Perpetrator of the September 11, 2001 attacks","categories":["1973 births","2001 deaths","American Airlines Flight 11","Participants in the September 11 attacks","People from 'Asir Province","Saudi Arabian al-Qaeda members","Saudi Arabian mass murderers"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade 11\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

Both had expressed interest in joining the jihad in Chechnya, though may have been diverted to Afghanistan. Before disappearing, the al-Shehri brothers went to Al-Seqley Mosque to swear an oath and commitment to jihad, as did Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi. Wail al-Shehri presided over the ceremony, dubbing himself Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi after one of Muhammad's companions. In March 2000, he left for Pakistan with Waleed and Ahmed al-Nami; later, they went on to Afghanistan. Wail al-Shehri followed the standard path for new al-Qaeda recruits in Afghanistan, spending time in the Khalden training camp and then Al Farouq training camp near Kandahar. Details on how the non-pilot (\"muscle\") hijackers were chosen for the September 11 attacks are vague, though the hijackers appear to have been selected by senior al-Qaeda leaders in 2000 from the thousands of recruits at training camps in Afghanistan. The most capable and motivated volunteers were at al-Farouq, and Saudi citizens were good candidates, since it would be easy for them to obtain visas to travel to the United States. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director George Tenet later said that the muscle hijackers were probably told little about their mission in the United States. Once al-Shehri and the other muscle hijackers completed their training in Afghanistan, they received \\$2,000 so they could return to Saudi Arabia to obtain new passports and visas. The al-Shehri brothers may have been assisted by a relative who worked in the Saudi passport office. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri received passports on October 3, 2000, and then obtained United States visas on October 24. On his visa application, Wail al-Shehri provided vague information, stating his employer\/school as \"South City\", and his destination as \"Wasantwn\". Al-Shehri indicated his occupation as \"teacher\", and that he would be traveling with his brother on a four-to-six month vacation, which would be paid for with al-Shehri's teacher salary. Although he would not be working while on vacation, consular officials nonetheless did not question if the al-Shehri brothers had the financial means to support themselves while in the United States. In late 2000, al-Shehri traveled to the United Arab Emirates, where he purchased traveler's checks, presumed to have been paid for by Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi. Five other hijackers passed through the United Arab Emirates and purchased traveler's checks, including Majed Moqed, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Haznawi and Ahmed al-Nami. The 9\/11 Commission believes that in mid-November 2000, three of the future muscle hijackers, including the al-Shehri brothers, traveled in a group from Saudi Arabia to Beirut and then onward to Iran where they could travel through to Afghanistan without getting their passports stamped. An associate of a senior Hezbollah operative is thought to have been on the same flight, although this may have been a coincidence. Wail al-Shehri appeared together with hijackers Ahmed al-Nami, Hamza al-Ghamdi, and Ahmed al-Ghamdi on a video recorded in March 2001, and aired on Al Jazeera in September 2002. Al-Shehri was seen studying maps and flight manuals, but he did not speak in the video; it also included a segment of Abdulaziz al-Omari reading his last will and testament. While in Afghanistan, another video was recorded that showed al-Shehri reading his last will and testament. This video was released on September 7, 2006.","h_score":1809528.9812500002,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":855465,"revid":1169712142,"description":"Perpetrator of the September 11, 2001 attacks","categories":["1973 births","2001 deaths","American Airlines Flight 11","Participants in the September 11 attacks","People from 'Asir Province","Saudi Arabian al-Qaeda members","Saudi Arabian mass murderers"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 11\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

Though probably conceived as a structure like the palace Sargon built at Dur-Sharrukin, Sennacherib's palace, and especially the artwork featured within it, shows some differences. Though Sargon's reliefs usually show the king as close to other members of the Assyrian aristocracy, Sennacherib's art usually depicts the king towering above everyone else in his vicinity due to being mounted in a chariot. His reliefs show larger scenes, some almost from a bird's-eye point of view. There are also examples of a more naturalistic approach in the art; where colossal statues of bulls from Sargon's palace depict them with five legs so that four legs could be seen from either side and two from the front, Sennacherib's bulls all have four legs. Sennacherib constructed beautiful gardens at his new palace, importing various plants and herbs from throughout his empire and beyond. Cotton plants may have been imported from as far away as India. Some suggest the famous Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, were actually these gardens in Nineveh. Eckhart Frahm considers this idea unlikely on account of the impressive royal gardens in Babylon itself. Besides the palace, Sennacherib oversaw other building projects at Nineveh. He built a large second palace at the city's southern mound, which served as an arsenal to store military equipment and as permanent quarters for part of the Assyrian standing army. Numerous temples were built and restored, many of them on the Kuyunjik mound (where the Southwest Palace was located), including a temple dedicated to the god S\u00een (invoked in the king's own name). Sennacherib also massively expanded the city to the south and erected enormous new city walls, surrounded by a moat, up to 25 metres (82 ft) high and 15 metres (49 ft) thick.","h_score":1956582.6500000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":28334,"revid":1171845270,"description":"King of Assyria","categories":["681 BC deaths","740s BC births","7th-century BC Assyrian kings","7th-century BC Babylonian kings","7th-century BC murdered monarchs","8th-century BC Assyrian kings","8th-century BC Babylonian kings","Biblical murder victims","Kings of the Universe","Male murder victims","Monarchs in the Hebrew Bible","Sargonid dynasty","Sennacherib","Year of birth uncertain"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Sennacherib?  \nA1: Sennacherib was an Assyrian king who ruled from 705 to 681 BC.  \n\nQ2: When and where did he live?  \nA2: He lived in the 8th and 7th centuries BC in ancient Mesopotamia, specifically Assyria.  \n\nQ3: What was his main role?  \nA3: He served as king of the Assyrian Empire, focusing on military expansion.  \n\nQ4: What were his key military campaigns?  \nA4: He led invasions of Babylon and Judah, including the siege of Jerusalem in 701 BC.  \n\nQ5: How did he govern conquered territories?  \nA5: He often deported populations and destroyed cities to maintain control.  \n\nQ6: What building projects did he undertake?  \nA6: He constructed palaces and aqueducts in Nineveh, his capital.  \n\nQ7: How did he die?  \nA7: He was assassinated by his sons in 681 BC during a rebellion.  \n\nQ8: What is his historical legacy?  \nA8: He is remembered for expanding Assyria and his detailed inscriptions, which provide historical insights."}

I barricaded him with outposts, and exit from the gate of his city I made taboo for him.\" Thus, Jerusalem was blockaded in some capacity, though the lack of massive military activities and appropriate equipment meant that it was probably not a full siege. According to the Biblical narrative, a senior Assyrian official with the title Rabshakeh stood in front of the city's walls and demanded its surrender, threatening that the Judeans would 'eat feces and drink urine' during the siege. Although the Assyrian account of the operation may lead one to believe that Sennacherib was present in person, this is never explicitly stated and reliefs depicting the campaign show Sennacherib seated on a throne in Lachish instead of overseeing the preparations for an assault on Jerusalem. According to the biblical account, the Assyrian envoys to Hezekiah returned to Sennacherib to find him engaged in a struggle with the city of Libnah. The account of the blockade erected around Jerusalem is different from the sieges described in Sennacherib's annals and the massive reliefs in Sennacherib's palace at Nineveh, which depict the successful siege of Lachish rather than events at Jerusalem. Though the blockade of Jerusalem was not a proper siege, it is clear from all available sources that a massive Assyrian army was encamped in the city's vicinity, probably on its northern side. Though it is clear that the blockade of Jerusalem ended without significant fighting, how it was resolved and what stopped Sennacherib's massive army from overwhelming the city is uncertain. The Biblical account of the end of Sennacherib's attack on Jerusalem holds that though Hezekiah's soldiers manned the walls of the city, ready to defend it against the Assyrians, an entity referred to as the destroying angel, sent by Yahweh, annihilated Sennacherib's army, killing 185,000 Assyrian soldiers in front of Jerusalem's gates. The ancient Greek historian Herodotus describes the operation as an Assyrian failure due to a \"multitude of field-mice\" descending upon the Assyrian camp, devouring crucial material such as quivers and bowstrings, leaving the Assyrians unarmed and causing them to flee. It is possible that the story of the mice infestation is an allusion to some kind of disease striking the Assyrian camp, possibly the septicemic plague. An alternative hypothesis, first advanced by journalist Henry T. Aubin in 2001, is that the blockade of Jerusalem was lifted through the intervention of a Kushite army from Egypt. The battle is considered unlikely to have been an outright Assyrian defeat, especially because contemporary Babylonian chronicles, otherwise eager to mention Assyrian failures, are silent on the matter. Despite the seemingly inconclusive end to the blockade of Jerusalem, the Levantine campaign was largely an Assyrian victory. After the Assyrians had seized many of Judah's most important fortified cities and destroyed several towns and villages, Hezekiah realized that his anti-Assyrian activities had been disastrous military and political miscalculations and accordingly submitted to the Assyrians once more. He was forced to pay a heavier tribute than previously, probably along with a heavy penalty and the tribute that he had failed to send to Nineveh from 705 to 701 BC. He was also forced to release the imprisoned king of Ekron, Padi, and Sennacherib granted substantial portions of Judah's land to the neighboring kingdoms of Gaza, Ashdod and Ekron.","h_score":1956582.6500000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":28334,"revid":1171845270,"description":"King of Assyria","categories":["681 BC deaths","740s BC births","7th-century BC Assyrian kings","7th-century BC Babylonian kings","7th-century BC murdered monarchs","8th-century BC Assyrian kings","8th-century BC Babylonian kings","Biblical murder victims","Kings of the Universe","Male murder victims","Monarchs in the Hebrew Bible","Sargonid dynasty","Sennacherib","Year of birth uncertain"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Sennacherib?  \nA1: Sennacherib was an ancient Assyrian king, ruling from 705 to 681 BCE, known for his fierce military prowess and grand ambitions.\n\nQ2: When and where did he live?  \nA2: He reigned in the 7th century BCE in Mesopotamia, with his capital at Nineveh, a bustling hub of power and innovation.\n\nQ3: What was his main role?  \nA3: As king, he led Assyria's empire, expanding territories through conquest while overseeing massive building projects that showcased his vision.\n\nQ4: What were his key military campaigns?  \nA4: Sennacherib famously besieged Jerusalem and destroyed Babylon, using iron-fisted tactics that echoed across ancient battlefields.\n\nQ5: Did he focus on construction?  \nA5: Yes, he built opulent palaces in Nineveh, including the grand \"Palace Without Rival,\" adorned with vivid reliefs of his victories.\n\nQ6: How did his rule impact Assyria?  \nA6: His conquests bolstered Assyria's might but sparked rebellions, weaving a legacy of glory and turmoil in the empire's tapestry.\n\nQ7: What challenges did he face?  \nA7: Internal revolts and foreign alliances against him tested his rule, culminating in a dramatic assassination by his own sons.\n\nQ8: What is his historical legacy?  \nA8: Sennacherib's records offer vivid glimpses into ancient life, influencing our understanding of Assyrian culture and its echoes in history."}

These inscriptions were not written by the king, but by his royal scribes. They often served as propaganda meant to portray the king as better than all other rulers, both contemporary and ancient. Furthermore, Assyrian royal inscriptions often describe only military and construction matters and were highly formulaic, differing little from king to king. By examining the inscriptions and comparing them to those of other kings and non-royal inscriptions, it is possible to infer some aspects of Sennacherib's character. Like the inscriptions of other Assyrian kings, his show pride and high self-esteem, for instance in the passage: \"Ashur, father of the gods, looked steadfastly upon me among all the rulers and he made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises.\" In several places, Sennacherib's great intelligence is emphasized, for instance in the passage, \"the god Ninshiku gave me wide understanding equal to (that of) the sage Adapu (and) endowed me with broad knowledge\". Several inscriptions call him \"foremost of all rulers\" (a\u0161ared kal malk\u012b) and a \"perfect man\" (e\u1e6dlu gitm\u0101lu). Sennacherib's decision to keep his birth name when he became king rather than assuming a throne name, something at least 19 of his 21 immediate predecessors had done, suggests self-confidence. Sennacherib assumed several new epithets never used by Assyrian kings, such as \"guardian of the right\" and \"lover of justice\", suggesting a desire to leave a personal mark on a new era beginning with his reign. When Sennacherib became king, he was already an adult and had served as Sargon's crown prince for over 15 years and understood the empire's administration. Unlike many preceding and later Assyrian kings (including his father), Sennacherib did not portray himself as a conqueror or express much desire to conquer the world. Instead, his inscriptions often portrayed the most important parts of his reign as his large-scale building projects. Most of Sennacherib's campaigns were not aimed at conquest, but at suppressing revolts against his rule, restoring lost territories and securing treasure to finance his building projects. That his generals led several of the campaigns, rather than Sennacherib himself, shows he was not as interested in campaigning as his predecessors had been.

There, he subdued the Yasubigallians, a people from east of the Tigris river, and the Kassites, a people who had ruled Babylonia centuries before. Sennacherib's third campaign, directed against the kingdoms and city-states in the Levant, is very well-documented compared to many other events in the ancient Near East and is the best-documented event in the history of Israel during the First Temple period. In 705 BC, Hezekiah, the king of Judah, had stopped paying his annual tribute to the Assyrians and began pursuing a markedly aggressive foreign policy, probably inspired by the recent wave of anti-Assyrian rebellions across the empire. After conspiring with Egypt (then under Kushite rule) and Sidqia, an anti-Assyrian king of the city of Ashkelon, to garner support, Hezekiah attacked Philistine cities loyal to Assyria and captured the Assyrian vassal Padi, king of Ekron, and imprisoned him in his capital, Jerusalem. In the northern Levant, former Assyrian vassal cities rallied around Luli, the king of Tyre and Sidon. Sennacherib's arch-enemy Marduk-apla-iddina encouraged the anti-Assyrian sentiment among some of the empire's western vassals. He corresponded with and sent gifts to western rulers like Hezekiah, probably hoping to assemble a vast anti-Assyrian alliance. In 701 BC, Sennacherib first moved to attack the Syro-Hittite and Phoenician cities in the north. Like many rulers of these cities had done before and would do again, Luli fled rather than face the wrath of the Assyrians, escaping by boat until he was beyond Sennacherib's reach. In his stead, Sennacherib proclaimed a noble by the name Ethbaal as the new king of Sidon and his vassal and oversaw the submission of many of the surrounding cities to his rule. Faced with a massive Assyrian army nearby, many of the Levantine rulers, including Budu-ilu of Ammon, Kamusu-nadbi of Moab, Mitinti of Ashdod and Malik-rammu of Edom, quickly submitted to Sennacherib to avoid retribution. The resistance in the southern Levant was not as easily suppressed, forcing Sennacherib to invade the region. The Assyrians began by taking Ashkelon and defeating Sidqia.

Both the blockade of Jerusalem and the siege of Lachish probably prevented further Egyptian aid from reaching Hezekiah, and intimidated the kings of other smaller states in the region. The siege of Lachish, which ended in the city's destruction, was so lengthy that the defenders eventually began using arrowheads made of bone rather than metal, which had run out. To take the city, the Assyrians constructed a great siege mound, a ramp made of earth and stone, to reach the top of Lachish's walls. After they had destroyed the city, the Assyrians deported the survivors to the Assyrian Empire, forcing some of them to work on Sennacherib's building projects, and others to serve in the king's personal guard.","h_score":1956582.6500000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":28334,"revid":1171845270,"description":"King of Assyria","categories":["681 BC deaths","740s BC births","7th-century BC Assyrian kings","7th-century BC Babylonian kings","7th-century BC murdered monarchs","8th-century BC Assyrian kings","8th-century BC Babylonian kings","Biblical murder victims","Kings of the Universe","Male murder victims","Monarchs in the Hebrew Bible","Sargonid dynasty","Sennacherib","Year of birth uncertain"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Sennacherib: The Assyrian King Who Reshaped Empires\n\nSennacherib ruled Assyria from 705 to 681 BC, known for his military campaigns and urban projects in Nineveh.

Though Babylonia to the south had also once been a large kingdom, it was typically weaker than its northern neighbor during this period, due to internal divisions and the lack of a well-organized army. The population of Babylonia was divided into various ethnic groups with different priorities and ideals. Though old native Babylonians ruled most of the cities, such as Kish, Ur, Uruk, Borsippa, Nippur, and Babylon itself, Chaldean tribes led by chieftains who often squabbled with each other dominated most of the southernmost land. The Arameans lived on the fringes of settled land and were notorious for plundering surrounding territories. Because of the infighting of these three major groups, Babylonia often represented an appealing target for Assyrian campaigns. The two kingdoms had competed since the rise of the Middle Assyrian Empire in the 14th century BC, and in the 8th century BC, the Assyrians consistently gained the upper hand. Babylon's internal and external weakness led to its conquest by the Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser III in 729 BC.\n\nDuring the expansion of Assyria into a major empire, the Assyrians had conquered various neighboring kingdoms, either annexing them as Assyrian provinces or turning them into vassal states. Because the Assyrians venerated the long history and culture of Babylon, it was preserved as a full kingdom, either ruled by an appointed client king, or by the Assyrian king in a personal union. The relationship between Assyria and Babylonia was similar to the relationship between Greece and Rome in later centuries; much of Assyria's culture, texts and traditions had been imported from the south. Assyria and Babylonia also shared the same language (Akkadian). The relationship between Assyria and Babylon was emotional in a sense; Neo-Assyrian inscriptions implicitly gender the two countries, calling Assyria the metaphorical \"husband\" and Babylon its \"wife\". In the words of the Assyriologist Eckart Frahm, \"the Assyrians were in love with Babylon, but also wished to dominate her\". Though Babylon was respected as the well-spring of civilization, it was expected to remain passive in political matters, something that Assyria's \"Babylonian bride\" repeatedly refused to be.\n\n ## Reign\n\n","h_score":1956582.6500000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":28334,"revid":1171845270,"description":"King of Assyria","categories":["681 BC deaths","740s BC births","7th-century BC Assyrian kings","7th-century BC Babylonian kings","7th-century BC murdered monarchs","8th-century BC Assyrian kings","8th-century BC Babylonian kings","Biblical murder victims","Kings of the Universe","Male murder victims","Monarchs in the Hebrew Bible","Sargonid dynasty","Sennacherib","Year of birth uncertain"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Assyrian Titan: Sennacherib's Ruthless Reign\n\nSennacherib, the iron-fisted Assyrian king from 705 to 681 BC, conquered vast lands and famously besieged Jerusalem, blending brutal warfare with grand construction.

The first reason for this is Sennacherib's negative portrayal in the Bible as the evil conqueror who attempted to take Jerusalem; the second is his destruction of Babylon, one of the most prominent cities in the ancient world. This negative view of Sennacherib endured until modern times. Sennacherib is presented as akin to a ruthless predator, attacking Judah as a \"wolf on the fold\" in the famous 1815 poem The Destruction of Sennacherib by Lord Byron: > The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold, > And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold; > And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea, > When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee. Biblical archaeologist Isaac Kalimi and historian Seth Richardson described Sennacherib's 701 BC attack against Jerusalem as a \"world event\" in 2014, noting that it drew together the fates of numerous otherwise disparate groups. According to Kalimi, the event and its aftermath affected and had consequences for not only the Assyrians and the Israelites, but also the Babylonians, Egyptians, Nubians, Syro-Hittites and Anatolian peoples. The siege is discussed not only in contemporary sources, but in later folklore and traditions, such as Aramaic folklore, in later Greco-Roman histories of the Near East and in the tales of medieval Syriac Christians and Arabs. Sennacherib's Levantine campaign is a significant event in the Bible, being brought up and discussed in many places, notably 2 Kings 18:13\u201319:37, 20:6 and 2 Chronicles 32:1\u201323. A vast majority of the Biblical accounts of King Hezekiah's reign in 2 Kings is dedicated to Sennacherib's campaign, cementing it as the most important event of Hezekiah's time. In Chronicles, Sennacherib's failure and Hezekiah's success is emphasized. The Assyrian campaign (described as an act of aggression rather than as a response to Hezekiah's rebellious activities) is seen as doomed to fail from the start. According to the narrative, no enemy, not even the powerful king of Assyria, would have been able to triumph over Hezekiah as the Judean king had God on his side. The conflict is presented as something akin to a holy war: God's war against the pagan Sennacherib. Though Assyria had more than a hundred kings throughout its long history, Sennacherib (along with his son Esarhaddon and grandsons Ashurbanipal and Shamash-shum-ukin) is one of the few kings who was remembered and figured in Aramaic and Syriac folklore long after the kingdom had fallen. The ancient Aramaic story of Ahikar portrays Sennacherib as a benevolent patron of the titular character Ahikar, with Esarhaddon portrayed more negatively. Medieval Syriac tales characterize Sennacherib as an archetypical pagan king assassinated as part of a family feud, whose children convert to Christianity. The legend of the 4th-century Saints Behnam and Sarah casts Sennacherib, under the name Sinharib, as their royal father. After Behnam converts to Christianity, Sinharib orders his execution, but is later struck by a dangerous disease that is cured through being baptized by Saint Matthew in Assur. Thankful, Sinharib then converts to Christianity and founds an important monastery near Mosul, called Deir Mar Mattai. Sennacherib also occupied various roles in later Jewish tradition. In Midrash, examinations of the Old Testament and later stories, the events of 701 BC are often explored in detail; many times featuring massive armies deployed by Sennacherib and pointing out how he repeatedly consulted astrologers on his campaign, delaying his actions. In the stories, Sennacherib's armies are destroyed when Hezekiah recites Hallel psalms on the eve of Passover. The event is often portrayed as an apocalyptic scenario, with Hezekiah portrayed as a messianic figure and Sennacherib and his armies being personifications of Gog and Magog. Sennacherib, due to the role he plays in the Bible, remains one of the most famous Assyrian kings to this day.''''''","h_score":1956582.6500000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":28334,"revid":1171845270,"description":"King of Assyria","categories":["681 BC deaths","740s BC births","7th-century BC Assyrian kings","7th-century BC Babylonian kings","7th-century BC murdered monarchs","8th-century BC Assyrian kings","8th-century BC Babylonian kings","Biblical murder victims","Kings of the Universe","Male murder victims","Monarchs in the Hebrew Bible","Sargonid dynasty","Sennacherib","Year of birth uncertain"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade 8\n\n**Learning Objectives:**  \n1.

The consolidation of Charles III's position in Naples also contributed to the formation of a party of noblemen who supported his claim to Hungary. John Horvat, Ban of Macs\u00f3 (now Ma\u010dva in Serbia), and his brother, Paul, Bishop of Zagreb, were the leading figures of their movement. Sigismund of Luxembourg tried to persuade the queen mother to consent to his marriage to Mary, but she refused him. He left Hungary in early 1385.\n\nThe queens and their supporters initiated negotiations with the representatives of the opposition, but no reconciliation was reached at their meeting in Po\u017eega in the spring of 1385. After a French delegation came to Hungary in May 1385, Mary was engaged to Louis of France. Louis of France thereafter signed his letters \"Louis of France, King of Hungary\", according to Jean Froissart. In the same month, the queen mother dismissed Stephen Lackfi, accusing him of high treason. She also sent letters to Zagreb and other places in the kingdom, forbidding the local inhabitants to support Lackfi, Nicholas Sz\u00e9csi, Bishop Paul Horvat and their relatives. John and Paul Horvat and their allies formally offered the crown to Charles III of Naples and invited him to Hungary in August. In the same month, Mary confirmed Tvrtko I of Bosnia's acquisition of Kotor in Dalmatia. Sigismund stormed into Upper Hungary, accompanied by his cousins, Jobst and Prokop of Moravia, and occupied Pozsony County. The queen mother replaced Nicholas Garai with Nicholas Sz\u00e9csi, and made Stephen Lackfi voivode of Transylvania and Nicholas Z\u00e1mb\u00f3 master of the treasury.\n\nCharles III of Naples landed at Senj in Dalmatia in September 1385 and marched to Zagreb. Sigismund of Luxembourg came to Buda and persuaded the queen mother to give her consent to his marriage to Mary. The marriage took place in Buda in October, but Sigismund was not crowned king and received no governmental function. The queen mother convoked a new Diet and Mary again confirmed the noblemen's liberties, but the queens' rule remained unpopular. Sigismund left Buda and mortgaged the territories west of the River V\u00e1g to his Moravian cousins. Charles of Naples had meanwhile left Zagreb, stating that he wanted to restore peace and public order in Hungary.\n\n ### Charles's reign (1385\u20131386)\n\nMany noblemen joined Charles of Naples who marched towards Buda. Mary and her mother received him ceremoniously before he reached Buda, and he entered the capital in the two queens' company in early December 1385. Mary renounced the crown without resistance in the middle of December out of fear that Charles would kill her. Charles first adopted the title governor, but the Diet elected him king. Charles was crowned king of Hungary in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r on 31 December. According to the contemporaneous Lorenzo de Monacis, Mary and her mother, who attended Charles's coronation, visited Louis the Great's tomb during the ceremony where they burst into tears because of their ill fate.\n\nCharles did not detain Mary and her mother who continued to live in the royal palace in Buda. Queen Elizabeth and Nicholas Garai decided to get rid of Charles. They persuaded Blaise Forg\u00e1ch, the master of the cupbearers, to join them, promising him the domain of Gimes (now Jelenec in Slovakia) if he murdered the king. Upon Queen Elizabeth's request, Charles visited her and her daughter on 7 February 1386. During the meeting, Blaise Forg\u00e1ch attacked the king, seriously injuring him on the head. The wounded King Charles was carried to Visegr\u00e1d where he died on 24 February.\n\n","h_score":1857622.5250000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":20677,"revid":1167232285,"description":"14th century Queen of Hungary and Croatia","categories":["1371 births","1395 deaths","14th-century Hungarian people","14th-century Hungarian women","14th-century women rulers","Burials at Oradea Cathedral, Cri\u015fana","Daughters of kings","Deaths by horse-riding accident","Deaths in childbirth","Dethroned monarchs","Electresses of Brandenburg","House of Anjou-Hungary","House of Luxembourg","Hungarian princesses","Medieval child monarchs","People of Byzantine descent","Polish princesses","Queens regnant of Hungary"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Mary, Queen of Hungary?  \nA1: Mary I was the queen of Hungary and Croatia from 1382 to 1395.

She was the daughter of Louis the Great, King of Hungary and Poland, and his wife, Elizabeth of Bosnia. Mary's marriage to Sigismund of Luxembourg, a member of the imperial Luxembourg dynasty, was already decided before her first birthday. A delegation of Polish prelates and lords confirmed her right to succeed her father in Poland in 1379.\n\nHaving no male siblings, Mary was crowned \"king\" of Hungary on 17 September 1382, seven days after Louis the Great's death. Her mother, who assumed regency, absolved the Polish noblemen from their oath of loyalty to Mary in favor of Mary's younger sister, Jadwiga, in early 1383. The idea of a female monarch remained unpopular among the Hungarian noblemen, the majority of whom regarded Mary's distant cousin, Charles III of Naples, as the lawful heir. To strengthen Mary's position, the queen mother wanted her to marry Louis, the younger brother of Charles VI of France. Their engagement was announced in May 1385.\n\nCharles III of Naples landed in Dalmatia in September 1385. Sigismund of Luxembourg invaded Upper Hungary (now Slovakia), forcing the queen mother to give Mary in marriage to him in October. However, they could not prevent Charles from entering Buda.

Mary was restored, but the slaughtered king's supporters captured her and her mother on 25 July. Queen Elizabeth was murdered in January 1387, but Mary was released on 4 June 1387. Mary officially remained the co-ruler with Sigismund, who had meanwhile been crowned king, but her influence on the government was minimal.

She was the second daughter of her parents. They had been childless for over a decade before Mary's older sister, Catherine, was born in 1370. Mary and Catherine gained another sibling, Jadwiga, in 1374.\n\nSince Louis had fathered no sons, the expectation that he would bequeath Hungary, Poland, and his claims to the Kingdom of Naples and Provence to his daughters made them desirable spouses for members of the European royal families. Before Mary's first birthday, her father made a promise to Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, that Mary would marry the emperor's second son, Sigismund of Luxembourg. Louis confirmed his promise in a deed in June 1373. Mary and Sigismund were closely related, because her paternal grandmother, Elizabeth of Poland, was the sister of his great-grandfather, Casimir III of Poland. Pope Gregory XI issued the dispensation necessary for their marriage on 6 December 1374. The leading Hungarian and Polish lords confirmed Louis's promise of Mary's and Sigismund's marriage on 14 April 1375.\n\nMary's older sister, Catherine, who had been betrothed to Louis of France, died in late 1378. Louis the Great confirmed his earlier promise of Mary's and Sigismund's marriage to Sigismund's brother, Wenceslaus, King of the Romans, in Z\u00f3lyom (now Zvolen in Slovakia) in 1379. Louis and Wenceslaus also agreed that they would acknowledge Urban VI as the lawful pope against Clement VII. Mary was formally engaged to Sigismund in Nagyszombat (now Trnava in Slovakia) in the same year. Sigismund, who had meanwhile become Margrave of Brandenburg, came to Hungary.\n\nLouis summoned the Polish prelates and lords to Kassa (now Ko\u0161ice in Slovakia) in September 1379, persuading them to acknowledge Mary's right to succeed him in Poland. The contemporaneous Jan of Czarnk\u00f3w, who was biased against Louis, recorded that the Poles yielded to the monarch's demand only after he had prevented them from leaving the town by shutting its gates. At a meeting with Leopold III, Duke of Austria in early 1380, Louis strongly hinted that he would bequeath Hungary to his younger daughter, Jadwiga, who had been engaged to Leopold III's son, William. Upon Louis's demand, a delegation of the Polish noblemen again paid homage to Sigismund and Mary on 25 July 1382. According to the historian Oscar Halecki, Louis wished to divide his kingdoms between his two surviving daughters, but P\u00e1l Engel and Claude Michaud write that the ailing king wanted to bequeath both Hungary and Poland on Mary and Sigismund.\n\n ## Reign\n\n","h_score":1857622.5250000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":20677,"revid":1167232285,"description":"14th century Queen of Hungary and Croatia","categories":["1371 births","1395 deaths","14th-century Hungarian people","14th-century Hungarian women","14th-century women rulers","Burials at Oradea Cathedral, Cri\u015fana","Daughters of kings","Deaths by horse-riding accident","Deaths in childbirth","Dethroned monarchs","Electresses of Brandenburg","House of Anjou-Hungary","House of Luxembourg","Hungarian princesses","Medieval child monarchs","People of Byzantine descent","Polish princesses","Queens regnant of Hungary"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Mary, Queen of Hungary?  \nA1: She was a 14th-century ruler, daughter of Louis I, crowned young amid medieval splendor.  \n\nQ2: When and where was she born?  \nA2: Born in 1371 in Hungary, her arrival sparked royal intrigue like a hidden gem in a crown.  \n\nQ3: What was her family background?  \nA3: From the Anjou dynasty, she inherited thrones through bloodlines woven like intricate tapestries of power.  \n\nQ4: How did she become queen?  \nA4: Succeeding her father at age five, her reign began as a playful yet perilous game of crowns.  \n\nQ5: What key events marked her rule?  \nA5: She faced invasions and alliances, navigating storms of war with the finesse of a chess master queen.  \n\nQ6: How did she influence Hungary?  \nA6: Promoting arts and diplomacy, she shaped Hungary's culture like a vivid brushstroke on history's canvas.  \n\nQ7: What challenges did she encounter?  \nA7: Kidnappings and rival claims tested her, turning her life into a dramatic tale of shadows and light.  \n\nQ8: What is her legacy today?  \nA8: Remembered as a resilient figure, her story echoes in Hungary's heritage, a timeless whisper of strength."}

Cardinal Demetrius, Archbishop of Esztergom, crowned Mary \"king\" with the Holy Crown of Hungary in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r on 17 September, a day after her father's burial. Mary's title and her rapid coronation in the absence of her fianc\u00e9, Sigismund, show that her mother and her mother's supporters wanted to emphasize Mary's role as monarch and to postpone or even hinder Sigismund's coronation. The queen mother, Elizabeth, assumed regency. Palatine Nicholas Garai and Cardinal Demetrius became her main advisors. Most of Louis's barons preserved their offices; the queen mother only dismissed the master of the cupbearers, George Czudar, and his brother Peter, voivode of Ruthenia. According to the 15th-century historian Jan D\u0142ugosz, the Czudar brothers surrendered forts to the Lithuanians, who had \"[h]eavily bribed\" them. Queen Elizabeth had Peter Czudar imprisoned before 1 November; her charters only stated that he \"had obviously been disloyal\" without specifying the reasons for his arrest. All royal charters issued during the first six months of Mary's reign emphasized that she had lawfully inherited her father's crown. However, most Hungarian noblemen were strongly opposed to the very idea of a female monarch. They regarded Charles III of Naples as Louis the Great's legitimate heir because Charles was the last male offspring of the Capetian House of Anjou. Charles could not openly lay claim to Hungary, because his rival for the Kingdom of Naples, Louis I, Duke of Anjouwho was Charles VI of France's unclehad invaded Southern Italy in the previous year. Noblemen from Greater Poland offered to pay homage to either Mary or Jadwiga at a meeting in Radomsko on 25 November, but they stipulated that the queen and her husband should live in Poland. The assembly of the nobility of Lesser Poland passed a similar resolution in Wi\u015blica on 12 December. On the latter occasion, in response to Queen Elizabeth's demand, the noblemen also promised that they would not pay homage to anyone else than either Mary or Jadwiga. Mary's fianc\u00e9, Sigismund, who had stayed in Poland, returned to Hungary. Bodzanta, Archbishop of Gniezno, the Na\u0142\u0119cz family, and their allies in Greater Poland favored a native prince, Siemowit IV of Masovia. To avoid a civil war, Queen Elizabeth sent envoys to the Polish noblemen's next assembly which met in Sieradz in late February 1383. Her envoys absolved the Poles from their 1382 oath of loyalty to Mary on 28 March, announcing that the queen mother would send her younger daughter, Jadwiga, to Poland. John of Palisna, Prior of Vrana, rose up in open rebellion against the rule of Mary and her mother in the spring of 1383. The queens made Stephen Lackfi Ban of Croatia.","h_score":1857622.5250000001,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":20677,"revid":1167232285,"description":"14th century Queen of Hungary and Croatia","categories":["1371 births","1395 deaths","14th-century Hungarian people","14th-century Hungarian women","14th-century women rulers","Burials at Oradea Cathedral, Cri\u015fana","Daughters of kings","Deaths by horse-riding accident","Deaths in childbirth","Dethroned monarchs","Electresses of Brandenburg","House of Anjou-Hungary","House of Luxembourg","Hungarian princesses","Medieval child monarchs","People of Byzantine descent","Polish princesses","Queens regnant of Hungary"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade: 7\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

She wrote to, and later met with, Sir John Hall, a well-respected Canterbury member of the House of Representatives, inviting him to present the petition and support her cause. He did so, but no action resulted. Sheppard then produced a second pamphlet, Should Women Vote?, which presented statements on suffrage from notable people in New Zealand and overseas. The Electoral Bill was delayed until 1890, when on 5 August, Hall proposed a motion \"That in the opinion of the House, the right of voting for members of the House of Representatives should be extended to women.\" After vigorous debate, this was passed 37 votes to 11. On 21 August, Hall moved an amendment to the Electoral Bill to give women suffrage, but it was defeated by seven votes. Following the defeat, Hall suggested to Sheppard that a petition to parliament should be the next step. She drew up the wording for the petition, arranged for the forms to be printed, and campaigned hard for its support. During the 1890 election campaign, WCTU members attempted to ask all candidates about their position on women's suffrage. The petition contained 10,085 signatures (according to WCTU minutes), and Hall presented it to Parliament in 1891 as a new Electoral Bill went into committee. The petition was supported in Parliament by Hall, Alfred Saunders, and the Premier at the time, John Ballance. Hall moved an amendment to the Electoral Bill to give women suffrage; it passed with a majority of 25 votes. An opponent of suffrage, Walter Carncross, then moved an amendment which would also allow women to stand for parliament; this seemed a logical extension of Hall's amendment but was actually calculated to cause the Bill's failure in New Zealand's upper house, the New Zealand Legislative Council. The Bill indeed failed in the Upper House by two votes. In 1890, Sheppard was one of the founders of the Christian Ethical Society, a discussion group for both men and women, not limited to the members of a single church. In their first few meetings the topics included selfishness, conjugal relations, and dress reform. The Society gave Sheppard more confidence debating her ideas with people from diverse backgrounds. During 1891, Sheppard began editing a page in the Prohibitionist on behalf of the WCTU. The Prohibitionist was a fortnightly temperance paper with a circulation around New Zealand of over 20,000. Sheppard used the pseudonym \"Penelope\" in this paper. Sheppard promised that a second petition would be twice as large and worked through the summer to organise it; it received 20,274 women's signatures. Using paid canvassers, the Liberal MP Henry Fish organised two counter petitions, one signed by men and the other by women; they received 5,000 signatures between them. An Electoral Bill in 1892 included provision for women's suffrage and again it easily passed in the House of Representatives, but the Upper House requested that women's votes be postal rather than by ballot. As the two houses could not agree on this, the bill failed. A third petition for suffrage, still larger, was organised by Sheppard and presented in 1893. This time 31,872 women signed\u2014the largest petition of any kind presented to Parliament at this point. ### 1893 Electoral Bill\n\nThe Electoral Bill of 1893, which granted women full voting rights, successfully passed in the House of Representatives in August. Few MPs were willing to vote against it, fearing that women would vote against them in the general election later that year. Many therefore chose to be absent from the house during votes. Henry Fish attempted to delay the proposed statute by calling for a national referendum, but the Bill progressed to the Legislative Council. After several attempts to stymie passage failed, the legislation passed 20 votes to 18 on 8 September. The Bill now needed the Governor's signature, and although Governor David Boyle did not support women's suffrage and was slow to sign, he eventually did so on 19 September.

In particular, she was concerned about establishing legal and economic independence of women from men. She was not only occupied with advancing women's rights, but also promoted political reforms such as proportional representation, binding referendums, and a Cabinet elected directly by Parliament. By 1902, Sheppard's marriage appears to have been under strain, and possibly had been for several years. Her husband sold their house and moved to England with their son, who wished to study in London. Sheppard bought new furnishings and appeared to be planning for a new permanent residence in Christchurch, but sold them in 1903, stepped down from her positions at the National Council of Women, and moved to England without any fixed date to return. On the way she briefly stopped in Canada and the United States where she met the American suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt. In London, she was active in promoting women's suffrage, but her health deteriorated further, forcing her to stop this work. In November 1904, Sheppard returned to New Zealand with her husband, but he went back to England in March the following year. She moved into the house of her long-time friends William Sidney Lovell-Smith and his wife Jennie Lovell-Smith; their third daughter, Hilda Kate Lovell-Smith, had been given her middle name after Sheppard. She remained relatively inactive in political circles, and stopped giving speeches, but continued to write. She prepared a display on the history of women's suffrage for the 1906 Exhibition in Christchurch, and wrote the pamphlet Woman Suffrage in New Zealand for the International Women's Suffrage Alliance in 1907. The following year she travelled to England for her son's wedding, visiting the headquarters of the WCTU in Chicago on the way, and meeting with suffrage groups after arriving in Britain. In 1912 and 1913, she travelled with the Lovell-Smiths through India and Europe. While she did not recover her former energy, her health had stopped declining, and she continued to be effective in influencing the New Zealand women's movement. She was the first to sign a petition to the Prime Minister, Sir Joseph Ward, in 1916, asking him to urge the British government to enfranchise women, and she revitalised the National Council of Women along with a group of other prominent suffragists in 1918. Sheppard was elected president of the National Council that year before stepping down in 1919. Sheppard's husband Walter died in England in 1915. Jennie Lovell-Smith died in 1924, and Sheppard and William Lovell-Smith married in 1925. Lovell-Smith died only four years later, and Sheppard herself died in Christchurch on 13 July 1934 at the age of 86. As her son Douglas had died of pernicious anaemia at the age of 29 in 1910, and her only grandchild, Margaret Isabel Sheppard, had died of tuberculosis at the age of 19 in 1930, Sheppard left no living direct descendants. She was buried at Addington Cemetery, Christchurch, in a grave with her mother and her brother Robert.","h_score":1754612.14375,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":460069,"revid":1173356978,"description":"New Zealand suffragist (1848\u20131934)","categories":["1848 births","1934 deaths","19th-century New Zealand people","19th-century New Zealand women","20th-century New Zealand people","20th-century New Zealand women","Burials at Addington Cemetery, Christchurch","English emigrants to New Zealand","English people of Scottish descent","Female Christian socialists","New Zealand Christian socialists","New Zealand feminists","New Zealand people of Scottish descent","New Zealand suffragists","New Zealand temperance activists","Pamphleteers","Politicians from Liverpool","Woman's Christian Temperance Union people"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Kate Sheppard?  \nA1: Kate Sheppard was a pioneering New Zealand suffragist in the late 1800s.\n\nQ2: When and where was she born?  \nA2: Born in 1848 in London, England, she later moved to New Zealand as a young woman.\n\nQ3: What was her main cause?  \nA3: She championed women's right to vote, rallying petitions and public support with fiery passion.\n\nQ4: How did she organize her efforts?  \nA4: Sheppard led signature drives and wrote persuasive articles, building a nationwide movement like a rising tide.\n\nQ5: What successes did she achieve?  \nA5: Her work helped New Zealand grant women voting rights in 1893, a global first and landmark victory.\n\nQ6: How did her actions influence others?  \nA6: Sheppard's tactics inspired suffragists worldwide, sparking waves of change across continents with her bold vision.\n\nQ7: What challenges did she face?  \nA7: She battled societal resistance and conservative laws, yet persevered with unyielding determination and clever strategies.\n\nQ8: What is her legacy today?  \nA8: Sheppard symbolizes women's empowerment; her image graces New Zealand's currency, honoring her as a trailblazing icon."}

There she became an active member of various religious and social organisations, including the Women's Christian Temperance Union New Zealand (WCTU NZ).

Her father, born in Scotland in 1819, was described in various documents as either a lawyer, banker, brewer's clerk, or legal clerk; he married Souter in the Inner Hebrides on 14 July 1842. Catherine was named after her paternal grandmother, also Catherine Wilson Malcolm, but preferred to spell her name \"Katherine\" or to abbreviate it to \"Kate\". She had an elder sister Marie, born in Scotland, and three younger siblings \u2013 Frank, born in Birmingham, and Isabella and Robert, both born in London; evidently, the family moved often during that period. Details of the children's education are unknown, though Kate's later writings demonstrate extensive knowledge of science and law, indicating a strong education. She was known for her broad knowledge and intellectual ability. Her father loved music and ensured that the family had good musical training. Kate's father died in 1862, while in his early forties, but left his widow with sufficient means to provide for the family. After her father's death, Kate lived with her uncle, a minister of the Free Church of Scotland at Nairn; he, more than anyone else, instilled in her the values of Christian socialism. During this time, the rest of the family stayed with relatives in Dublin, where Kate later joined them. George Beath, the future husband of Kate's sister Marie, emigrated to Melbourne in 1863, and later moved to Christchurch. After Marie joined him there, they were married in 1867, and their first child was born the following year. Marie's accounts of Christchurch motivated Jemima to move her family to New Zealand, as she was seeking better prospects for her sons' employment and wanted to see her granddaughter. They sailed on the Matoaka from Gravesend on 12 November 1868, arriving in Lyttelton Harbour on 8 February 1869. In Christchurch, most of the family, including Kate, joined the Trinity Congregational Church. The minister was William Habens, a graduate of the University of London who was also Classics Master at Christchurch High School. Kate became part of Christchurch's intellectual and social scenes, and spent time with Marie and George's growing family. Kate married Walter Allen Sheppard, a shop owner, at her mother's house on 21 July 1871. Walter had been elected to the Christchurch City Council in 1868, and may have impressed Kate with his knowledge of local matters. They lived on Madras Street, not far from her mother's home, and within walking distance of the city centre. The Trinity Congregational Church raised funds for a new building from 1872 to 1874, and Kate was most likely involved in this. She formed a friendship with Alfred Saunders, a politician and prominent temperance activist who may have influenced her ideas on women's suffrage. Sheppard and her husband arrived in England in 1877 and spent a year there, then returned to Christchurch. Their only child, Douglas, was born on 8 December 1880. Sheppard was an active member of various Christian organisations. She taught Sunday school, and in 1884 was elected secretary of the newly formed Trinity Ladies' Association, a body established to visit parishioners who did not regularly attend church services. The association also helped with fundraising and did jobs for the church such as providing morning tea. Sheppard wrote reports on the work of the Association, tried to recruit new members, and worked to retain existing ones. The following year she joined the Riccarton Choral Society. Her solo in a May 1886 concert was praised in the Lyttelton Times. She also served on the management committee of the YWCA. ## Women's suffrage movement\n\n","h_score":1754612.14375,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":460069,"revid":1173356978,"description":"New Zealand suffragist (1848\u20131934)","categories":["1848 births","1934 deaths","19th-century New Zealand people","19th-century New Zealand women","20th-century New Zealand people","20th-century New Zealand women","Burials at Addington Cemetery, Christchurch","English emigrants to New Zealand","English people of Scottish descent","Female Christian socialists","New Zealand Christian socialists","New Zealand feminists","New Zealand people of Scottish descent","New Zealand suffragists","New Zealand temperance activists","Pamphleteers","Politicians from Liverpool","Woman's Christian Temperance Union people"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade: 6\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

Born in Liverpool, England, she emigrated to New Zealand with her family in 1868. There she became an active member of various religious and social organisations, including the Women's Christian Temperance Union New Zealand (WCTU NZ). In 1887 she was appointed the WCTU NZ's National Superintendent for Franchise and Legislation, a position she used to advance the cause of women's suffrage in New Zealand.\n\nKate Sheppard promoted women's suffrage by organising petitions and public meetings, by writing letters to the press, and by developing contacts with politicians. She was the editor of The White Ribbon, the first woman-operated newspaper in New Zealand. Through her skilful writing and persuasive public speaking, she successfully advocated women's suffrage. Her pamphlets Ten Reasons Why the Women of New Zealand Should Vote and Should Women Vote? contributed to the cause. This work culminated in a petition with 30,000 signatures calling for women's suffrage that was presented to parliament, and the successful extension of the franchise to women in 1893. As a result, New Zealand became the first country to establish universal suffrage.\n\nSheppard was the first president of the National Council of Women of New Zealand, founded in 1896, and helped reform the organisation in 1918. In later life, she travelled to Britain and assisted the suffrage movement there. With failing health, she returned to New Zealand, after which she continued to be involved in writing on women's rights, although she became less politically active. She died in 1934, leaving no descendants.\n\nSheppard is considered to be an important figure in New Zealand's history. A memorial to her exists in Christchurch.

In 1885 Leavitt toured New Zealand speaking not only about the problems caused by alcohol consumption, but also the need for women to have a \"voice in public affairs\". She spent two weeks in Christchurch, starting with a public speech at the Theatre Royal on 10 May. Journalists were impressed by the strength of public speaking displayed by a woman, something not witnessed often at that time in New Zealand. Sheppard became involved in establishing a Christchurch branch of the WCTU NZ prior to the formation of a national organisation. Her initial involvement was in promoting petitions to Parliament to prevent women being employed as barmaids, and to outlaw the sale of alcohol to children. This marked the beginning of her collaborations with Alfred Saunders, who advised her on her negotiations with politicians and who wrote to the Premier, Sir Robert Stout, seeking to further her campaign. The barmaid petitions (including some from other parts of the country) were rejected by the Petitions Committee of Parliament later in 1885. Sheppard decided that politicians would continue to ignore petitions from women as long as women could not vote. In 1879 universal male suffrage had been granted to all men over the age of 21 whether they owned property or not, but women were still excluded as electors. A limited number of voting rights were extended to female voters in the 1870s. Female ratepayers were able to vote in local body elections in 1873, and in 1877 women \"householders\" were given the right to vote in and stand for education boards. The New Zealand Women's Christian Temperance Union was formed under the leadership of Anne Ward at a conference in Wellington in February 1886. Sheppard did not attend that conference, but at the second national convention in Christchurch a year later, she arrived ready to present a paper on women's suffrage, although there was no opportunity for her to do so. She was first appointed Superintendent for Relative Statistics, owing to her interest in economics. In 1887\u2014when more local Franchise departments were established within the WCTU NZ\u2014she replaced Mrs. G Clarke as National Superintendent for the Franchise and Legislation. Much of the support for moderation came from women, and the WCTU NZ believed that women's suffrage could advance their aim to prohibit alcohol while promoting child and family welfare. Sheppard soon became prominent in the area of women's suffrage, but her interest in the cause went beyond practical considerations regarding temperance. Her views were made well known with her statement that \"all that separates, whether of race, class, creed, or sex, is inhuman, and must be overcome.\" Sheppard proved to be a powerful speaker and a skilled organiser, quickly building support for her cause. The WCTU NZ sent a deputation to Sir Julius Vogel, a Member of Parliament and former Premier, asking him to introduce a suffrage bill to parliament. He did so in 1887, with the Female Suffrage Bill, and Sheppard campaigned for its support. In its third reading, the part dealing with women's suffrage was defeated by one vote, and the bill was withdrawn. During the general election campaign later that year Sheppard encouraged WCTU NZ members to ask parliamentary candidates questions about suffrage, but few women did so. In 1888 Sheppard was President of the Christchurch branch of the WCTU NZ, and presented a report to the national convention in Dunedin, where the convention decided that prohibition and women's suffrage would be the organisation's central aims. Sheppard made public speeches on suffrage in Dunedin, Oamaru, and Christchurch, developing a confident speaking style. To reinforce her message, she gave audiences leaflets produced in Britain and the United States. Sheppard then published her own single-sheet pamphlet titled Ten Reasons Why the Women of New Zealand Should Vote, which displayed her \"dry wit and logical approach\". A copy was sent to every member of the House of Representatives.","h_score":1754612.14375,"h_score_cat":8,"pageid":460069,"revid":1173356978,"description":"New Zealand suffragist (1848\u20131934)","categories":["1848 births","1934 deaths","19th-century New Zealand people","19th-century New Zealand women","20th-century New Zealand people","20th-century New Zealand women","Burials at Addington Cemetery, Christchurch","English emigrants to New Zealand","English people of Scottish descent","Female Christian socialists","New Zealand Christian socialists","New Zealand feminists","New Zealand people of Scottish descent","New Zealand suffragists","New Zealand temperance activists","Pamphleteers","Politicians from Liverpool","Woman's Christian Temperance Union people"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade 6\n\n**Learning Objectives:**\n1.

She grew up in Oxfordshire. Her father, Peter Clarke, was a theatre sound engineer from Wolverhampton. Her mother, Jennifer, was a businesswoman and is the vice-president for marketing at a global management consultancy firm as of 2020. Clarke has Indian ancestry on her mother's side of the family; her maternal grandmother was the child of a secret affair between Clarke's great-grandmother and a man from the Indian subcontinent, and wore light make-up to conceal the darker complexion she had inherited from her father. She credits this background for her family's having a \"history of fighters\", stating, \"The fact that [my grandmother] had to hide her skin colour, essentially, and try desperately to fit in with everyone else must've been incredibly difficult.\" She stated that her grandmother \"loved India more than she loved England\" and as such, when she died, sixteen-year-old Clarke travelled to India to scatter her ashes. She has an older brother, Bennett, who works in the entertainment industry and was part of the camera department on Game of Thrones.\n\nClarke became interested in acting at age three after seeing a production of the musical Show Boat. When she was ten, her father took her to a West End audition for The Goodbye Girl, a musical by Neil Simon. Clarke was educated at Rye St Antony School in Headington and St Edward's School, Oxford, which she left in 2005. In a 2016 interview with Time Out, she stated \"I went to posh boarding schools, but I wasn't the posh girl at the posh boarding schools.\" She also stated that most of the people at her boarding school in Oxford were from Conservative backgrounds, which meant she and some of her friends often felt like outsiders. After graduation, Clarke unsuccessfully applied to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. She worked and travelled before enrolling at Drama Centre London, where she graduated in 2009.\n\n ## Career\n\n ### 2000\u20132010: Beginnings\n\nClarke started to act in stage productions while attending school. She appeared in student productions of Twelfth Night and West Side Story while attending St Edward's School. After taking a sabbatical year, she was accepted into Drama Centre London. Clarke also appeared the 2009 production of Sense, co-produced by theatre company Company of Angels and Drama Centre London.\n\nOne of her first film roles was in Drop the Dog, a University of London student short film. She graduated from drama school in 2009. She worked at various non-acting jobs after graduating while auditioning for roles. She starred in two commercials for the charity Samaritans, portraying a domestic abuse victim. Her first credited television role was a bit part in a 2009 episode of the British soap opera Doctors. Clarke was cast in her first professional film role, playing Savannah in the 2010 television film Triassic Attack. The film was released in November 2010 on the Syfy channel in the United States where it received negative reviews. Despite the film's reviews, she was named a \"UK Star of Tomorrow\" by the film magazine Screen International.\n\n","h_score":1966182.9750000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":30175038,"revid":1173293518,"description":"British actress (born 1986)","categories":["1986 births","21st-century English actresses","Actresses from Berkshire","Actresses from London","Actresses from Oxfordshire","Alumni of the Drama Centre London","British people of Anglo-Indian descent","English contraltos","English film actresses","English stage actresses","English television actresses","English voice actresses","Living people","People educated at Rye St Antony School","People educated at St Edward's School, Oxford"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Emilia Clarke?  \nA1: She is a British actress.

It is based on the fantasy book series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin. Daenerys is one of the last surviving members of House Targaryen who had ruled Westeros from the Iron Throne for nearly three hundred years prior to being ousted. Actress Tamzin Merchant was originally cast for the part of Daenerys. When the pilot episode was re-shot in early 2010, Merchant was replaced by Clarke. The show ran from April 2011 until May 2019, with Clarke portraying Daenerys throughout all eight seasons.\n\nClarke received critical acclaim for her portrayal of Daenerys, which traces an arc from frightened girl to powerful woman. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe called her scenes \"mesmerising\", adding that \"Clarke doesn't have a lot of emotional variety to work with as Daenerys, aside from fierce determination, and yet she is riveting.\" Emily VanDerWerff for The A.V. Club commented on the difficulty of adapting such an evolution from page to screen, but concluded that Clarke \"more than seal[s] the deal here.\"\n\nClarke said by being cast as Daenerys, she had avoided the \"typical bonnet duty that you have to go through as a young British actress\". In 2017, she reportedly became one of the highest-paid actors on television, earning between \u00a31.2 and \u00a32 million per episode of Game of Thrones. In 2019, she said she had been uncomfortable acting nude in her first experience at age 23 of a large film set, but had since become \"a lot more savvy\" about what level of nudity is needed for a scene. Clarke received multiple award nominations and wins for her role of Daenerys. After the first season, Clarke won Best Supporting Actress in a Drama at the 2011 EWwy Awards. She was also nominated three times for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2013, 2015, and 2016. At the 2019 Emmys, she was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, her first nomination in the category.\n\nIn addition to the television show, she lent her voice and likeness to the 2014 video game of the same name. She also made a cameo appearance during Kit Harington's monologue on Saturday Night Live in April 2019. She said in a November 2019 NPR interview that if she \"were to get stereotyped as the mother of dragons, I could ask for worse. It's really quite wonderful.\" In a 2021 interview with theSkimm, Clarke stated that she would change the way her character died.\n\n","h_score":1966182.9750000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":30175038,"revid":1173293518,"description":"British actress (born 1986)","categories":["1986 births","21st-century English actresses","Actresses from Berkshire","Actresses from London","Actresses from Oxfordshire","Alumni of the Drama Centre London","British people of Anglo-Indian descent","English contraltos","English film actresses","English stage actresses","English television actresses","English voice actresses","Living people","People educated at Rye St Antony School","People educated at St Edward's School, Oxford"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Emilia Clarke?  \nA1: Emilia Clarke is a British actress, born in 1986, famed for her roles in TV and film.\n\nQ2: What is her most famous role?  \nA2: She's best known as Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones, a fiery queen with dragons.\n\nQ3: How did she start acting?  \nA3: Clarke began with stage work and TV roles, landing her breakout in Game of Thrones in 2011.\n\nQ4: Has she faced personal challenges?  \nA4: Yes, she survived two brain aneurysms, bravely sharing her story to raise awareness.\n\nQ5: What other projects has she done?  \nA5: Beyond Thrones, she starred in Me Before You and voiced films like The Lego Movie 2.\n\nQ6: Has she won awards?  \nA6: Clarke earned Emmy nods and won a Critics' Choice Award for her dynamic performances.\n\nQ7: What causes does she support?  \nA7: She advocates for brain injury survivors via SameYou, her impactful charity.\n\nQ8: How has she influenced pop culture?  \nA8: Clarke's strong female characters inspire fans, blending vulnerability with power in modern storytelling."}

It is based on the fantasy book series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin. Daenerys is one of the last surviving members of House Targaryen who had ruled Westeros from the Iron Throne for nearly three hundred years prior to being ousted. Actress Tamzin Merchant was originally cast for the part of Daenerys. When the pilot episode was re-shot in early 2010, Merchant was replaced by Clarke. The show ran from April 2011 until May 2019, with Clarke portraying Daenerys throughout all eight seasons.\n\nClarke received critical acclaim for her portrayal of Daenerys, which traces an arc from frightened girl to powerful woman. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe called her scenes \"mesmerising\", adding that \"Clarke doesn't have a lot of emotional variety to work with as Daenerys, aside from fierce determination, and yet she is riveting.\" Emily VanDerWerff for The A.V. Club commented on the difficulty of adapting such an evolution from page to screen, but concluded that Clarke \"more than seal[s] the deal here.\"\n\nClarke said by being cast as Daenerys, she had avoided the \"typical bonnet duty that you have to go through as a young British actress\". In 2017, she reportedly became one of the highest-paid actors on television, earning between \u00a31.2 and \u00a32 million per episode of Game of Thrones. In 2019, she said she had been uncomfortable acting nude in her first experience at age 23 of a large film set, but had since become \"a lot more savvy\" about what level of nudity is needed for a scene. Clarke received multiple award nominations and wins for her role of Daenerys. After the first season, Clarke won Best Supporting Actress in a Drama at the 2011 EWwy Awards. She was also nominated three times for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2013, 2015, and 2016. At the 2019 Emmys, she was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, her first nomination in the category.\n\nIn addition to the television show, she lent her voice and likeness to the 2014 video game of the same name. She also made a cameo appearance during Kit Harington's monologue on Saturday Night Live in April 2019. She said in a November 2019 NPR interview that if she \"were to get stereotyped as the mother of dragons, I could ask for worse. It's really quite wonderful.\" In a 2021 interview with theSkimm, Clarke stated that she would change the way her character died.\n\n","h_score":1966182.9750000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":30175038,"revid":1173293518,"description":"British actress (born 1986)","categories":["1986 births","21st-century English actresses","Actresses from Berkshire","Actresses from London","Actresses from Oxfordshire","Alumni of the Drama Centre London","British people of Anglo-Indian descent","English contraltos","English film actresses","English stage actresses","English television actresses","English voice actresses","Living people","People educated at Rye St Antony School","People educated at St Edward's School, Oxford"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who is Emilia Clarke?  \nA1: Emilia Clarke is a British actress who conquered hearts as Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones.\n\nQ2: What made her famous?  \nA2: Her fiery dragon-queen role ignited global fame, blending vulnerability with epic power.\n\nQ3: How did she begin acting?  \nA3: Starting in London's theater scene, she honed her craft before Hollywood beckoned.\n\nQ4: What other films has she starred in?  \nA4: She shone in Me Before You as a quirky caregiver, and in Last Christmas with holiday charm.\n\nQ5: Has she faced personal challenges?  \nA5: Surviving two brain aneurysms, she turned fear into fierce advocacy for health awareness.\n\nQ6: What causes does she support?  \nA6: Clarke champions brain injury charities, wielding her story like a knight's sword for good.\n\nQ7: How has she impacted entertainment?  \nA7: She shattered stereotypes of strong female leads, inspiring a new wave of storytellers.\n\nQ8: What's next for her career?  \nA8: With upcoming projects, Clarke continues to weave magic, blending stardom with meaningful tales."}

She grew up in Oxfordshire. Her father, Peter Clarke, was a theatre sound engineer from Wolverhampton. Her mother, Jennifer, was a businesswoman and is the vice-president for marketing at a global management consultancy firm as of 2020. Clarke has Indian ancestry on her mother's side of the family; her maternal grandmother was the child of a secret affair between Clarke's great-grandmother and a man from the Indian subcontinent, and wore light make-up to conceal the darker complexion she had inherited from her father. She credits this background for her family's having a \"history of fighters\", stating, \"The fact that [my grandmother] had to hide her skin colour, essentially, and try desperately to fit in with everyone else must've been incredibly difficult.\" She stated that her grandmother \"loved India more than she loved England\" and as such, when she died, sixteen-year-old Clarke travelled to India to scatter her ashes. She has an older brother, Bennett, who works in the entertainment industry and was part of the camera department on Game of Thrones.\n\nClarke became interested in acting at age three after seeing a production of the musical Show Boat. When she was ten, her father took her to a West End audition for The Goodbye Girl, a musical by Neil Simon. Clarke was educated at Rye St Antony School in Headington and St Edward's School, Oxford, which she left in 2005. In a 2016 interview with Time Out, she stated \"I went to posh boarding schools, but I wasn't the posh girl at the posh boarding schools.\" She also stated that most of the people at her boarding school in Oxford were from Conservative backgrounds, which meant she and some of her friends often felt like outsiders. After graduation, Clarke unsuccessfully applied to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. She worked and travelled before enrolling at Drama Centre London, where she graduated in 2009.\n\n ## Career\n\n ### 2000\u20132010: Beginnings\n\nClarke started to act in stage productions while attending school. She appeared in student productions of Twelfth Night and West Side Story while attending St Edward's School. After taking a sabbatical year, she was accepted into Drama Centre London. Clarke also appeared the 2009 production of Sense, co-produced by theatre company Company of Angels and Drama Centre London.\n\nOne of her first film roles was in Drop the Dog, a University of London student short film. She graduated from drama school in 2009. She worked at various non-acting jobs after graduating while auditioning for roles. She starred in two commercials for the charity Samaritans, portraying a domestic abuse victim. Her first credited television role was a bit part in a 2009 episode of the British soap opera Doctors.

She grew up in Oxfordshire. Her father, Peter Clarke, was a theatre sound engineer from Wolverhampton. Her mother, Jennifer, was a businesswoman and is the vice-president for marketing at a global management consultancy firm as of 2020. Clarke has Indian ancestry on her mother's side of the family; her maternal grandmother was the child of a secret affair between Clarke's great-grandmother and a man from the Indian subcontinent, and wore light make-up to conceal the darker complexion she had inherited from her father. She credits this background for her family's having a \"history of fighters\", stating, \"The fact that [my grandmother] had to hide her skin colour, essentially, and try desperately to fit in with everyone else must've been incredibly difficult.\" She stated that her grandmother \"loved India more than she loved England\" and as such, when she died, sixteen-year-old Clarke travelled to India to scatter her ashes. She has an older brother, Bennett, who works in the entertainment industry and was part of the camera department on Game of Thrones.\n\nClarke became interested in acting at age three after seeing a production of the musical Show Boat. When she was ten, her father took her to a West End audition for The Goodbye Girl, a musical by Neil Simon. Clarke was educated at Rye St Antony School in Headington and St Edward's School, Oxford, which she left in 2005. In a 2016 interview with Time Out, she stated \"I went to posh boarding schools, but I wasn't the posh girl at the posh boarding schools.\" She also stated that most of the people at her boarding school in Oxford were from Conservative backgrounds, which meant she and some of her friends often felt like outsiders. After graduation, Clarke unsuccessfully applied to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. She worked and travelled before enrolling at Drama Centre London, where she graduated in 2009.\n\n ## Career\n\n ### 2000\u20132010: Beginnings\n\nClarke started to act in stage productions while attending school. She appeared in student productions of Twelfth Night and West Side Story while attending St Edward's School. After taking a sabbatical year, she was accepted into Drama Centre London. Clarke also appeared the 2009 production of Sense, co-produced by theatre company Company of Angels and Drama Centre London.\n\nOne of her first film roles was in Drop the Dog, a University of London student short film. She graduated from drama school in 2009. She worked at various non-acting jobs after graduating while auditioning for roles. She starred in two commercials for the charity Samaritans, portraying a domestic abuse victim. Her first credited television role was a bit part in a 2009 episode of the British soap opera Doctors. Clarke was cast in her first professional film role, playing Savannah in the 2010 television film Triassic Attack. The film was released in November 2010 on the Syfy channel in the United States where it received negative reviews. Despite the film's reviews, she was named a \"UK Star of Tomorrow\" by the film magazine Screen International.\n\n","h_score":1966182.9750000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":30175038,"revid":1173293518,"description":"British actress (born 1986)","categories":["1986 births","21st-century English actresses","Actresses from Berkshire","Actresses from London","Actresses from Oxfordshire","Alumni of the Drama Centre London","British people of Anglo-Indian descent","English contraltos","English film actresses","English stage actresses","English television actresses","English voice actresses","Living people","People educated at Rye St Antony School","People educated at St Edward's School, Oxford"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 8\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

In 1995, he accepted the David Cohen Prize, in recognition of a lifetime of literary achievement. In 1996, he received a Laurence Olivier Special Award for lifetime achievement in the theatre. In 1997 he became a BAFTA Fellow. He received the World Leaders Award for \"Creative Genius\" as the subject of a week-long \"Homage\" in Toronto, in October 2001. In 2004, he received the Wilfred Owen Award for Poetry for his \"lifelong contribution to literature, 'and specifically for his collection of poetry entitled War, published in 2003'\". In March 2006, he was awarded the Europe Theatre Prize in recognition of lifetime achievements pertaining to drama and theatre. In conjunction with that award, the critic Michael Billington coordinated an international conference on Pinter: Passion, Poetry, Politics, including scholars and critics from Europe and the Americas, held in Turin, Italy, from 10 to 14 March 2006.\n\nIn October 2008, the Central School of Speech and Drama announced that Pinter had agreed to become its president and awarded him an honorary fellowship at its graduation ceremony. On his appointment, Pinter commented: \"I was a student at Central in 1950\u201351. I enjoyed my time there very much and I am delighted to become president of a remarkable institution.\" But he had to receive that honorary degree, his 20th, in absentia owing to ill health. His presidency of the school was brief; he died just two weeks after the graduation ceremony, on 24 December 2008.\n\nIn 2013, he was posthumously awarded the Sretenje Order of Serbia.\n\n ### Nobel Prize in Literature\n\n ### L\u00e9gion d'honneur\n\nOn 18 January 2007, French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin presented Pinter with France's highest civil honour, the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, at a ceremony at the French embassy in London. De Villepin praised Pinter's poem \"American Football\" (1991) stating: \"With its violence and its cruelty, it is for me one of the most accurate images of war, one of the most telling metaphors of the temptation of imperialism and violence.\" In response, Pinter praised France's opposition to the war in Iraq. M. de Villepin concluded: \"The poet stands still and observes what doesn't deserve other men's attention. Poetry teaches us how to live and you, Harold Pinter, teach us how to live.\" He said that Pinter received the award particularly \"because in seeking to capture all the facets of the human spirit, [Pinter's] works respond to the aspirations of the French public, and its taste for an understanding of man and of what is truly universal\". Lawrence Pollard observed that \"the award for the great playwright underlines how much Mr Pinter is admired in countries like France as a model of the uncompromising radical intellectual\".\n\n","h_score":2032711.5750000002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":89530,"revid":1172856322,"description":"English playwright (1930\u20132008)","categories":["1930 births","2008 deaths","20th-century British dramatists and playwrights","20th-century British essayists","20th-century British novelists","20th-century British poets","20th-century British screenwriters","20th-century British short story writers","20th-century atheists","20th-century letter writers","21st-century British dramatists and playwrights","21st-century British essayists","21st-century British non-fiction writers","21st-century British poets","21st-century British screenwriters","21st-century British short story writers","21st-century atheists","Alumni of RADA","Alumni of the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama","BAFTA fellows","Best British Screenplay BAFTA Award winners","Best Screenplay BAFTA Award winners","Booker authors' division","British anthologists","British male essayists","British male television writers","British media critics","British psychological fiction writers","Burials at Kensal Green Cemetery","Commanders of the Order of the British Empire","David Cohen Prize recipients","Deaths from cancer in England","Deaths from liver cancer","English Ashkenazi Jews","English Jewish writers","English Nobel laureates","English activists","English anti-war activists","English anti\u2013Iraq War activists","English anti\u2013nuclear weapons activists","English atheists","English conscientious objectors","English essayists","English film directors","English human rights activists","English literary critics","English male dramatists and playwrights","English male film actors","English male non-fiction writers","English male novelists","English male poets","English male screenwriters","English male short story writers","English male stage actors","English male television actors","English pacifists","English people of Polish-Jewish descent","English people of Ukrainian-Jewish descent","English political writers","English radio writers","English social justice activists","English socialists","English sociologists","English television directors","English television writers","English theatre directors","Fellows of the Royal Society of Literature","Foreign members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts","Free speech activists","Harold Pinter","Jewish English activists","Jewish English male actors","Jewish atheists","Jewish dramatists and playwrights","Laurence Olivier Award winners","Lecturers","Literacy and society theorists","Literary theorists","Mass media theorists","Members of the Academy of Arts, Berlin","Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour","Members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts","Nobel laureates in Literature","PEN International","People associated with Queen Mary University of London","People educated at Hackney Downs School","People from Lower Clapton","Recipients of the Legion of Honour","Rhetoric theorists","Sociologists of art","Surrealist writers","The arts and politics","Theatre of the Absurd","Theatre theorists","Theatrologists","Tony Award winners","Writers about activism and social change","Writers about globalization","Writers from Hackney Central","Writers of historical fiction set in the early modern period","Writers of historical fiction set in the modern age"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Harold Pinter?  \nA1: Harold Pinter was a British playwright, screenwriter, and director born in 1930 and died in 2008.  \n\nQ2: What is Pinter best known for?  \nA2: He is renowned for his plays exploring power dynamics and ambiguity.

However, he told interviewers that, if he had been old enough at the time, he would have fought against the Nazis in World War II. He seemed to express ambivalence, both indifference and hostility, towards political structures and politicians in his Fall 1966 Paris Review interview conducted by Lawrence M. Bensky. Yet, he had been an early member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and also had supported the British Anti-Apartheid Movement (1959\u20131994), participating in British artists' refusal to permit professional productions of their work in South Africa in 1963 and in subsequent related campaigns. In \"A Play and Its Politics\", a 1985 interview with Nicholas Hern, Pinter described his earlier plays retrospectively from the perspective of the politics of power and the dynamics of oppression. In his last 25 years, Pinter increasingly focused his essays, interviews and public appearances directly on political issues. He was an officer in International PEN, travelling with American playwright Arthur Miller to Turkey in 1985 on a mission co-sponsored with a Helsinki Watch committee to investigate and protest against the torture of imprisoned writers. There he met victims of political oppression and their families. Pinter's experiences in Turkey and his knowledge of the Turkish suppression of the Kurdish language inspired his 1988 play Mountain Language. He was also an active member of the Cuba Solidarity Campaign, an organisation that \"campaigns in the UK against the US blockade of Cuba\". In 2001, Pinter joined the International Committee to Defend Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 (ICDSM), which appealed for a fair trial and for the freedom of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, signing a related \"Artists' Appeal for Milo\u0161evi\u0107\" in 2004. Pinter strongly opposed the 1991 Gulf War, the 1999 NATO bombing campaign in FR Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War, the United States' 2001 War in Afghanistan, and the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Among his provocative political statements, Pinter called Prime Minister Tony Blair a \"deluded idiot\" and compared the administration of President George W. Bush to Nazi Germany. He stated that the United States \"was charging towards world domination while the American public and Britain's 'mass-murdering' prime minister sat back and watched.\" He was very active in the antiwar movement in the United Kingdom, speaking at rallies held by the Stop the War Coalition and frequently criticising American aggression, as when he asked rhetorically, in his acceptance speech for the Wilfred Owen Award for Poetry on 18 March 2007: \"What would Wilfred Owen make of the invasion of Iraq? A bandit act, an act of blatant state terrorism, demonstrating absolute contempt for the conception of international law.\" Pinter earned a reputation for being pugnacious, enigmatic, taciturn, terse, prickly, explosive and forbidding. Pinter's blunt political statements, and the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature, elicited strong criticism and even, at times, provoked ridicule and personal attacks. The historian Geoffrey Alderman, author of the official history of Hackney Downs School, expressed his own \"Jewish View\" of Harold Pinter: \"Whatever his merit as a writer, actor and director, on an ethical plane Harold Pinter seems to me to have been intensely flawed, and his moral compass deeply fractured.\" David Edgar, writing in The Guardian, defended Pinter against what he termed Pinter's \"being berated by the belligerati\" like Johann Hari, who felt that he did not \"deserve\" to win the Nobel Prize. Later Pinter continued to campaign against the Iraq War and on behalf of other political causes that he supported. Pinter signed the mission statement of Jews for Justice for Palestinians in 2005 and its full-page advertisement, \"What Is Israel Doing? A Call by Jews in Britain\", published in The Times on 6 July 2006, and he was a patron of the Palestine Festival of Literature. In April 2008, Pinter signed the statement \"We're not celebrating Israel's anniversary\". The statement noted: \"We cannot celebrate the birthday of a state founded on terrorism, massacres and the dispossession of another people from their land.\", \"We will celebrate when Arab and Jew live as equals in a peaceful Middle East\" ## Career\n\n","h_score":2032711.5750000002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":89530,"revid":1172856322,"description":"English playwright (1930\u20132008)","categories":["1930 births","2008 deaths","20th-century British dramatists and playwrights","20th-century British essayists","20th-century British novelists","20th-century British poets","20th-century British screenwriters","20th-century British short story writers","20th-century atheists","20th-century letter writers","21st-century British dramatists and playwrights","21st-century British essayists","21st-century British non-fiction writers","21st-century British poets","21st-century British screenwriters","21st-century British short story writers","21st-century atheists","Alumni of RADA","Alumni of the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama","BAFTA fellows","Best British Screenplay BAFTA Award winners","Best Screenplay BAFTA Award winners","Booker authors' division","British anthologists","British male essayists","British male television writers","British media critics","British psychological fiction writers","Burials at Kensal Green Cemetery","Commanders of the Order of the British Empire","David Cohen Prize recipients","Deaths from cancer in England","Deaths from liver cancer","English Ashkenazi Jews","English Jewish writers","English Nobel laureates","English activists","English anti-war activists","English anti\u2013Iraq War activists","English anti\u2013nuclear weapons activists","English atheists","English conscientious objectors","English essayists","English film directors","English human rights activists","English literary critics","English male dramatists and playwrights","English male film actors","English male non-fiction writers","English male novelists","English male poets","English male screenwriters","English male short story writers","English male stage actors","English male television actors","English pacifists","English people of Polish-Jewish descent","English people of Ukrainian-Jewish descent","English political writers","English radio writers","English social justice activists","English socialists","English sociologists","English television directors","English television writers","English theatre directors","Fellows of the Royal Society of Literature","Foreign members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts","Free speech activists","Harold Pinter","Jewish English activists","Jewish English male actors","Jewish atheists","Jewish dramatists and playwrights","Laurence Olivier Award winners","Lecturers","Literacy and society theorists","Literary theorists","Mass media theorists","Members of the Academy of Arts, Berlin","Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour","Members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts","Nobel laureates in Literature","PEN International","People associated with Queen Mary University of London","People educated at Hackney Downs School","People from Lower Clapton","Recipients of the Legion of Honour","Rhetoric theorists","Sociologists of art","Surrealist writers","The arts and politics","Theatre of the Absurd","Theatre theorists","Theatrologists","Tony Award winners","Writers about activism and social change","Writers about globalization","Writers from Hackney Central","Writers of historical fiction set in the early modern period","Writers of historical fiction set in the modern age"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Harold Pinter?  \nA1: Harold Pinter was a British playwright, screenwriter, and director, born in 1930 and died in 2008.

He also directed or acted in radio, stage, television and film productions of his own and others' works.\n\nPinter was born and raised in Hackney, east London, and educated at Hackney Downs School. He was a sprinter and a keen cricket player, acting in school plays and writing poetry. He attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art but did not complete the course. He was fined for refusing national service as a conscientious objector. Subsequently, he continued training at the Central School of Speech and Drama and worked in repertory theatre in Ireland and England. In 1956 he married actress Vivien Merchant and had a son, Daniel, born in 1958. He left Merchant in 1975 and married author Lady Antonia Fraser in 1980.\n\nPinter's career as a playwright began with a production of The Room in 1957. His second play, The Birthday Party, closed after eight performances but was enthusiastically reviewed by critic Harold Hobson. His early works were described by critics as \"comedy of menace\". Later plays such as No Man's Land (1975) and Betrayal (1978) became known as \"memory plays\". He appeared as an actor in productions of his own work on radio and film, and directed nearly 50 productions for stage, theatre and screen. Pinter received over 50 awards, prizes and other honours, including the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2005 and the French L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 2007.\n\nDespite frail health after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer in December 2001, Pinter continued to act on stage and screen, last performing the title role of Samuel Beckett's one-act monologue Krapp's Last Tape, for the 50th anniversary season of the Royal Court Theatre, in October 2006. He died from liver cancer on 24 December 2008.\n\n ## Biography\n\n","h_score":2032711.5750000002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":89530,"revid":1172856322,"description":"English playwright (1930\u20132008)","categories":["1930 births","2008 deaths","20th-century British dramatists and playwrights","20th-century British essayists","20th-century British novelists","20th-century British poets","20th-century British screenwriters","20th-century British short story writers","20th-century atheists","20th-century letter writers","21st-century British dramatists and playwrights","21st-century British essayists","21st-century British non-fiction writers","21st-century British poets","21st-century British screenwriters","21st-century British short story writers","21st-century atheists","Alumni of RADA","Alumni of the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama","BAFTA fellows","Best British Screenplay BAFTA Award winners","Best Screenplay BAFTA Award winners","Booker authors' division","British anthologists","British male essayists","British male television writers","British media critics","British psychological fiction writers","Burials at Kensal Green Cemetery","Commanders of the Order of the British Empire","David Cohen Prize recipients","Deaths from cancer in England","Deaths from liver cancer","English Ashkenazi Jews","English Jewish writers","English Nobel laureates","English activists","English anti-war activists","English anti\u2013Iraq War activists","English anti\u2013nuclear weapons activists","English atheists","English conscientious objectors","English essayists","English film directors","English human rights activists","English literary critics","English male dramatists and playwrights","English male film actors","English male non-fiction writers","English male novelists","English male poets","English male screenwriters","English male short story writers","English male stage actors","English male television actors","English pacifists","English people of Polish-Jewish descent","English people of Ukrainian-Jewish descent","English political writers","English radio writers","English social justice activists","English socialists","English sociologists","English television directors","English television writers","English theatre directors","Fellows of the Royal Society of Literature","Foreign members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts","Free speech activists","Harold Pinter","Jewish English activists","Jewish English male actors","Jewish atheists","Jewish dramatists and playwrights","Laurence Olivier Award winners","Lecturers","Literacy and society theorists","Literary theorists","Mass media theorists","Members of the Academy of Arts, Berlin","Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour","Members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts","Nobel laureates in Literature","PEN International","People associated with Queen Mary University of London","People educated at Hackney Downs School","People from Lower Clapton","Recipients of the Legion of Honour","Rhetoric theorists","Sociologists of art","Surrealist writers","The arts and politics","Theatre of the Absurd","Theatre theorists","Theatrologists","Tony Award winners","Writers about activism and social change","Writers about globalization","Writers from Hackney Central","Writers of historical fiction set in the early modern period","Writers of historical fiction set in the modern age"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Harold Pinter?

Billington observes that \"The break-up with Vivien and the new life with Antonia was to have a profound effect on Pinter's personality and his work,\" though he adds that Fraser herself did not claim to have influence over Pinter or his writing. In her own contemporaneous diary entry dated 15 January 1993, Fraser described herself more as Pinter's literary midwife. Indeed, she told Billington that \"other people [such as Peggy Ashcroft, among others] had a shaping influence on [Pinter's] politics\" and attributed changes in his writing and political views to a change from \"an unhappy, complicated personal life ... to a happy, uncomplicated personal life\", so that \"a side of Harold which had always been there was somehow released. I think you can see that in his work after No Man's Land [1975], which was a very bleak play.\" Pinter was content in his second marriage and enjoyed family life with his six adult stepchildren and 17 step-grandchildren. Even after battling cancer for several years, he considered himself \"a very lucky man in every respect\". Sarah Lyall notes in her 2007 interview with Pinter in The New York Times that his \"latest work, a slim pamphlet called 'Six Poems for A.', comprises poems written over 32 years, with \"A\" of course being Lady Antonia. The first of the poems was written in Paris, where she and Mr. Pinter traveled soon after they met. More than three decades later the two are rarely apart, and Mr. Pinter turns soft, even cozy, when he talks about his wife.\" In that interview Pinter \"acknowledged that his plays\u2014full of infidelity, cruelty, inhumanity, the lot\u2014seem at odds with his domestic contentment. 'How can you write a happy play?' he said. 'Drama is about conflict and degrees of perturbation, disarray. I've never been able to write a happy play, but I've been able to enjoy a happy life.'\" After his death, Fraser told The Guardian: \"He was a great man, and it was a privilege to live with him for over 33 years.

Revivals in 2008 included the 40th-anniversary production of the American premi\u00e8re of The Homecoming on Broadway, directed by Daniel J. Sullivan. From 8 to 24 May 2008, the Lyric Hammersmith celebrated the 50th anniversary of The Birthday Party with a revival and related events, including a gala performance and reception hosted by Harold Pinter on 19 May 2008, exactly 50 years after its London premi\u00e8re there. The final revival during Pinter's lifetime was a production of No Man's Land, directed by Rupert Goold, opening at the Gate Theatre, Dublin, in August 2008, and then transferring to the Duke of York's Theatre, London, where it played until 3 January 2009. On the Monday before Christmas 2008, Pinter was admitted to Hammersmith Hospital, where he died on Christmas Eve from liver cancer, aged 78. On 26 December 2008, when No Man's Land reopened at the Duke of York's, the actors paid tribute to Pinter from the stage, with Michael Gambon reading Hirst's monologue about his \"photograph album\" from Act Two that Pinter had asked him to read at his funeral, ending with a standing ovation from the audience, many of whom were in tears: > I might even show you my photograph album. You might even see a face in it which might remind you of your own, of what you once were. You might see faces of others, in shadow, or cheeks of others, turning, or jaws, or backs of necks, or eyes, dark under hats, which might remind you of others, whom once you knew, whom you thought long dead, but from whom you will still receive a sidelong glance if you can face the good ghost. Allow the love of the good ghost. They possess all that emotion ... trapped. Bow to it. It will assuredly never release them, but who knows ... what relief ... it may give them ... who knows how they may quicken ... in their chains, in their glass jars. You think it cruel ... to quicken them, when they are fixed, imprisoned? No ... no. Deeply, deeply, they wish to respond to your touch, to your look, and when you smile, their joy ... is unbounded. And so I say to you, tender the dead, as you would yourself be tendered, now, in what you would describe as your life. ## Posthumous events\n\n ### Funeral\n\nPinter's funeral was a private, half-hour secular ceremony conducted at the graveside at Kensal Green Cemetery, 31 December 2008. The eight readings selected in advance by Pinter included passages from seven of his own writings and from the story \"The Dead\", by James Joyce, which was read by actress Penelope Wilton. Michael Gambon read the \"photo album\" speech from No Man's Land and three other readings, including Pinter's poem \"Death\" (1997). Other readings honoured Pinter's widow and his love of cricket. The ceremony was attended by many notable theatre people, including Tom Stoppard, but not by Pinter's son, Daniel Brand. At its end, Pinter's widow, Antonia Fraser, stepped forward to his grave and quoted from Horatio's speech after the death of Hamlet: \"Goodnight, sweet prince, \/ And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.\"\n\n","h_score":2032711.5750000002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":89530,"revid":1172856322,"description":"English playwright (1930\u20132008)","categories":["1930 births","2008 deaths","20th-century British dramatists and playwrights","20th-century British essayists","20th-century British novelists","20th-century British poets","20th-century British screenwriters","20th-century British short story writers","20th-century atheists","20th-century letter writers","21st-century British dramatists and playwrights","21st-century British essayists","21st-century British non-fiction writers","21st-century British poets","21st-century British screenwriters","21st-century British short story writers","21st-century atheists","Alumni of RADA","Alumni of the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama","BAFTA fellows","Best British Screenplay BAFTA Award winners","Best Screenplay BAFTA Award winners","Booker authors' division","British anthologists","British male essayists","British male television writers","British media critics","British psychological fiction writers","Burials at Kensal Green Cemetery","Commanders of the Order of the British Empire","David Cohen Prize recipients","Deaths from cancer in England","Deaths from liver cancer","English Ashkenazi Jews","English Jewish writers","English Nobel laureates","English activists","English anti-war activists","English anti\u2013Iraq War activists","English anti\u2013nuclear weapons activists","English atheists","English conscientious objectors","English essayists","English film directors","English human rights activists","English literary critics","English male dramatists and playwrights","English male film actors","English male non-fiction writers","English male novelists","English male poets","English male screenwriters","English male short story writers","English male stage actors","English male television actors","English pacifists","English people of Polish-Jewish descent","English people of Ukrainian-Jewish descent","English political writers","English radio writers","English social justice activists","English socialists","English sociologists","English television directors","English television writers","English theatre directors","Fellows of the Royal Society of Literature","Foreign members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts","Free speech activists","Harold Pinter","Jewish English activists","Jewish English male actors","Jewish atheists","Jewish dramatists and playwrights","Laurence Olivier Award winners","Lecturers","Literacy and society theorists","Literary theorists","Mass media theorists","Members of the Academy of Arts, Berlin","Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour","Members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts","Nobel laureates in Literature","PEN International","People associated with Queen Mary University of London","People educated at Hackney Downs School","People from Lower Clapton","Recipients of the Legion of Honour","Rhetoric theorists","Sociologists of art","Surrealist writers","The arts and politics","Theatre of the Absurd","Theatre theorists","Theatrologists","Tony Award winners","Writers about activism and social change","Writers about globalization","Writers from Hackney Central","Writers of historical fiction set in the early modern period","Writers of historical fiction set in the modern age"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Harold Pinter: Master of Menace and Pause\n\nHarold Pinter was a groundbreaking British playwright whose works delved into the shadows of human interaction and power struggles.

The play transferred to the Duchess Theatre in May 1960 and ran for 444 performances, receiving an Evening Standard Award for best play of 1960. Large radio and television audiences for his one-act play A Night Out, along with the popularity of his revue sketches, propelled him to further critical attention. In 1964, The Birthday Party was revived both on television (with Pinter himself in the role of Goldberg) and on stage (directed by Pinter at the Aldwych Theatre) and was well received. By the time Peter Hall's London production of The Homecoming (1964) reached Broadway in 1967, Pinter had become a celebrity playwright, and the play garnered four Tony Awards, among other awards. During this period, Pinter also wrote the radio play A Slight Ache, first broadcast on the BBC Third Programme in 1959 and then adapted to the stage and performed at the Arts Theatre Club in 1961. A Night Out (1960) was broadcast to a large audience on ABC Weekend TV's television show Armchair Theatre, after being transmitted on BBC Radio 3, also in 1960. His play Night School was first televised in 1960 on Associated Rediffusion. The Collection premi\u00e8red at the Aldwych Theatre in 1962, and The Dwarfs, adapted from Pinter's then unpublished novel of the same title, was first broadcast on radio in 1960, then adapted for the stage (also at the Arts Theatre Club) in a double bill with The Lover, which had previously been televised by Associated Rediffusion in 1963; and Tea Party, a play that Pinter developed from his 1963 short story, first broadcast on BBC TV in 1965. Working as both a screenwriter and as a playwright, Pinter composed a script called The Compartment (1966), for a trilogy of films to be contributed by Samuel Beckett, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, and Pinter, of which only Beckett's film, titled Film, was actually produced. Then Pinter turned his unfilmed script into a television play, which was produced as The Basement, both on BBC 2 and also on stage in 1968. #### \"Memory plays\" (1968\u20131982)\n\nFrom the late 1960s through the early 1980s, Pinter wrote a series of plays and sketches that explore complex ambiguities, elegiac mysteries, comic vagaries, and other \"quicksand-like\" characteristics of memory and which critics sometimes classify as Pinter's \"memory plays\". These include Landscape (1968), Silence (1969), Night (1969), Old Times (1971), No Man's Land (1975), The Proust Screenplay (1977), Betrayal (1978), Family Voices (1981), Victoria Station (1982), and A Kind of Alaska (1982). Some of Pinter's later plays, including Party Time (1991), Moonlight (1993), Ashes to Ashes (1996), and Celebration (2000), draw upon some features of his \"memory\" dramaturgy in their focus on the past in the present, but they have personal and political resonances and other tonal differences from these earlier memory plays.\n\n","h_score":2032711.5750000002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":89530,"revid":1172856322,"description":"English playwright (1930\u20132008)","categories":["1930 births","2008 deaths","20th-century British dramatists and playwrights","20th-century British essayists","20th-century British novelists","20th-century British poets","20th-century British screenwriters","20th-century British short story writers","20th-century atheists","20th-century letter writers","21st-century British dramatists and playwrights","21st-century British essayists","21st-century British non-fiction writers","21st-century British poets","21st-century British screenwriters","21st-century British short story writers","21st-century atheists","Alumni of RADA","Alumni of the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama","BAFTA fellows","Best British Screenplay BAFTA Award winners","Best Screenplay BAFTA Award winners","Booker authors' division","British anthologists","British male essayists","British male television writers","British media critics","British psychological fiction writers","Burials at Kensal Green Cemetery","Commanders of the Order of the British Empire","David Cohen Prize recipients","Deaths from cancer in England","Deaths from liver cancer","English Ashkenazi Jews","English Jewish writers","English Nobel laureates","English activists","English anti-war activists","English anti\u2013Iraq War activists","English anti\u2013nuclear weapons activists","English atheists","English conscientious objectors","English essayists","English film directors","English human rights activists","English literary critics","English male dramatists and playwrights","English male film actors","English male non-fiction writers","English male novelists","English male poets","English male screenwriters","English male short story writers","English male stage actors","English male television actors","English pacifists","English people of Polish-Jewish descent","English people of Ukrainian-Jewish descent","English political writers","English radio writers","English social justice activists","English socialists","English sociologists","English television directors","English television writers","English theatre directors","Fellows of the Royal Society of Literature","Foreign members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts","Free speech activists","Harold Pinter","Jewish English activists","Jewish English male actors","Jewish atheists","Jewish dramatists and playwrights","Laurence Olivier Award winners","Lecturers","Literacy and society theorists","Literary theorists","Mass media theorists","Members of the Academy of Arts, Berlin","Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour","Members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts","Nobel laureates in Literature","PEN International","People associated with Queen Mary University of London","People educated at Hackney Downs School","People from Lower Clapton","Recipients of the Legion of Honour","Rhetoric theorists","Sociologists of art","Surrealist writers","The arts and politics","Theatre of the Absurd","Theatre theorists","Theatrologists","Tony Award winners","Writers about activism and social change","Writers about globalization","Writers from Hackney Central","Writers of historical fiction set in the early modern period","Writers of historical fiction set in the modern age"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Harold Pinter: The Master of Menacing Pauses\n\nHarold Pinter, the British Nobel laureate, transformed theater with his cryptic dialogues and explorations of power struggles, leaving audiences uneasy yet enthralled.\n\n**Early Life and Beginnings**  \nBorn in 1930 London, Pinter started as an actor, drawing from wartime experiences to fuel his writing.\n\n**Signature Works and Style**  \nHis plays like \"The Caretaker\" feature \"the rhythm of everyday menace,\" as Pinter himself noted, blending humor with tension.\n\n**Legacy and Influence**  \nPinter's impact on drama persists, with critic Martin Esslin declaring, \"He redefined the absurd.\"  \nLooking ahead, Pinter's techniques will likely shape experimental theater for decades."}

It was part of the 5th Annual PEN World Voices Festival of International Literature, taking place in New York City. Another memorial celebration, held in the Olivier Theatre, at the Royal National Theatre, in London, on the evening of 7 June 2009, consisted of excerpts and readings from Pinter's writings by nearly three dozen actors, many of whom were his friends and associates, including: Eileen Atkins, David Bradley, Colin Firth, Henry Goodman, Sheila Hancock, Alan Rickman, Penelope Wilton, Susan Wooldridge, and Henry Woolf; and a troupe of students from the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, directed by Ian Rickson.\n\nOn 16 June 2009, Antonia Fraser officially opened a commemorative room at the Hackney Empire. The theatre also established a writer's residency in Pinter's name. Most of issue number 28 of Craig Raine's Arts Tri-Quarterly Aret\u00e9 was devoted to pieces remembering Pinter, beginning with Pinter's 1987 unpublished love poem dedicated \"To Antonia\" and his poem \"Paris\", written in 1975 (the year in which he and Fraser began living together), followed by brief memoirs by some of Pinter's associates and friends, including Patrick Marber, Nina Raine, Tom Stoppard, Peter Nichols, Susanna Gross, Richard Eyre, and David Hare.\n\nA memorial cricket match at Lord's Cricket Ground between the Gaieties Cricket Club and the Lord's Taverners, followed by performances of Pinter's poems and excerpts from his plays, took place on 27 September 2009.\n\nIn 2009, English PEN established the PEN Pinter Prize, which is awarded annually to a British writer or a writer resident in Britain who, in the words of Pinter's Nobel speech, casts an 'unflinching, unswerving' gaze upon the world, and shows a 'fierce intellectual determination ... to define the real truth of our lives and our societies'. The prize is shared with an international writer of courage. The inaugural winners of the prize were Tony Harrison and the Burmese poet and comedian Maung Thura (a.k.a. Zarganar).\n\n ### Being Harold Pinter\n\nIn January 2011 Being Harold Pinter, a theatrical collage of excerpts from Pinter's dramatic works, his Nobel Lecture, and letters of Belarusian prisoners, created and performed by the Belarus Free Theatre, evoked a great deal of attention in the public media. The Free Theatre's members had to be smuggled out of Minsk, owing to a government crackdown on dissident artists, to perform their production in a two-week sold-out engagement at La MaMa in New York as part of the 2011 Under the Radar Festival. In an additional sold-out benefit performance at the Public Theater, co-hosted by playwrights Tony Kushner and Tom Stoppard, the prisoner's letters were read by ten guest performers: Mandy Patinkin, Kevin Kline, Olympia Dukakis, Lily Rabe, Linda Emond, Josh Hamilton, Stephen Spinella, Lou Reed, Laurie Anderson, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. In solidarity with the Belarus Free Theatre, collaborations of actors and theatre companies joined in offering additional benefit readings of Being Harold Pinter across the United States.\n\n ### The Harold Pinter Theatre, London\n\nIn September 2011, British Theatre owners, Ambassador Theatre Group (ATG) announced it was renaming its Comedy Theatre, Panton Street, London to become The Harold Pinter Theatre. Howard Panter, Joint CEO and Creative Director of ATG told the BBC, \"The work of Pinter has become an integral part of the history of the Comedy Theatre. The re-naming of one of our most successful West End theatres is a fitting tribute to a man who made such a mark on British theatre who, over his 50 year career, became recognised as one of the most influential modern British dramatists.\"\n\n","h_score":2032711.5750000002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":89530,"revid":1172856322,"description":"English playwright (1930\u20132008)","categories":["1930 births","2008 deaths","20th-century British dramatists and playwrights","20th-century British essayists","20th-century British novelists","20th-century British poets","20th-century British screenwriters","20th-century British short story writers","20th-century atheists","20th-century letter writers","21st-century British dramatists and playwrights","21st-century British essayists","21st-century British non-fiction writers","21st-century British poets","21st-century British screenwriters","21st-century British short story writers","21st-century atheists","Alumni of RADA","Alumni of the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama","BAFTA fellows","Best British Screenplay BAFTA Award winners","Best Screenplay BAFTA Award winners","Booker authors' division","British anthologists","British male essayists","British male television writers","British media critics","British psychological fiction writers","Burials at Kensal Green Cemetery","Commanders of the Order of the British Empire","David Cohen Prize recipients","Deaths from cancer in England","Deaths from liver cancer","English Ashkenazi Jews","English Jewish writers","English Nobel laureates","English activists","English anti-war activists","English anti\u2013Iraq War activists","English anti\u2013nuclear weapons activists","English atheists","English conscientious objectors","English essayists","English film directors","English human rights activists","English literary critics","English male dramatists and playwrights","English male film actors","English male non-fiction writers","English male novelists","English male poets","English male screenwriters","English male short story writers","English male stage actors","English male television actors","English pacifists","English people of Polish-Jewish descent","English people of Ukrainian-Jewish descent","English political writers","English radio writers","English social justice activists","English socialists","English sociologists","English television directors","English television writers","English theatre directors","Fellows of the Royal Society of Literature","Foreign members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts","Free speech activists","Harold Pinter","Jewish English activists","Jewish English male actors","Jewish atheists","Jewish dramatists and playwrights","Laurence Olivier Award winners","Lecturers","Literacy and society theorists","Literary theorists","Mass media theorists","Members of the Academy of Arts, Berlin","Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour","Members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts","Nobel laureates in Literature","PEN International","People associated with Queen Mary University of London","People educated at Hackney Downs School","People from Lower Clapton","Recipients of the Legion of Honour","Rhetoric theorists","Sociologists of art","Surrealist writers","The arts and politics","Theatre of the Absurd","Theatre theorists","Theatrologists","Tony Award winners","Writers about activism and social change","Writers about globalization","Writers from Hackney Central","Writers of historical fiction set in the early modern period","Writers of historical fiction set in the modern age"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade 11-12\n\n**Learning Objectives:**\n1.

Like his plays of the 1980s, The Hothouse concerns authoritarianism and the abuses of power politics, but it is also a comedy, like his earlier comedies of menace. Pinter played the major role of Roote in a 1995 revival at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester. Pinter's brief dramatic sketch Precisely (1983) is a duologue between two bureaucrats exploring the absurd power politics of mutual nuclear annihilation and deterrence. His first overtly political one-act play is One for the Road (1984). In 1985 Pinter stated that whereas his earlier plays presented metaphors for power and powerlessness, the later ones present literal realities of power and its abuse. Pinter's \"political theatre dramatizes the interplay and conflict of the opposing poles of involvement and disengagement.\" Mountain Language (1988) is about the Turkish suppression of the Kurdish language. The dramatic sketch The New World Order (1991) provides what Robert Cushman, writing in The Independent described as \"10 nerve-wracking minutes\" of two men threatening to torture a third man who is blindfolded, gagged and bound in a chair; Pinter directed the British premi\u00e8re at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs, where it opened on 9 July 1991, and the production then transferred to Washington, D.C., where it was revived in 1994. Pinter's longer political satire Party Time (1991) premi\u00e8red at the Almeida Theatre in London, in a double-bill with Mountain Language. Pinter adapted it as a screenplay for television in 1992, directing that production, first broadcast in the UK on Channel 4 on 17 November 1992. Intertwining political and personal concerns, his next full-length plays, Moonlight (1993) and Ashes to Ashes (1996) are set in domestic households and focus on dying and death; in their personal conversations in Ashes to Ashes, Devlin and Rebecca allude to unspecified atrocities relating to the Holocaust. After experiencing the deaths of first his mother (1992) and then his father (1997), again merging the personal and the political, Pinter wrote the poems \"Death\" (1997) and \"The Disappeared\" (1998). Pinter's last stage play, Celebration (2000), is a social satire set in an opulent restaurant, which lampoons The Ivy, a fashionable venue in London's West End theatre district, and its patrons who \"have just come from performances of either the ballet or the opera. Not that they can remember a darn thing about what they saw, including the titles.","h_score":2032711.5750000002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":89530,"revid":1172856322,"description":"English playwright (1930\u20132008)","categories":["1930 births","2008 deaths","20th-century British dramatists and playwrights","20th-century British essayists","20th-century British novelists","20th-century British poets","20th-century British screenwriters","20th-century British short story writers","20th-century atheists","20th-century letter writers","21st-century British dramatists and playwrights","21st-century British essayists","21st-century British non-fiction writers","21st-century British poets","21st-century British screenwriters","21st-century British short story writers","21st-century atheists","Alumni of RADA","Alumni of the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama","BAFTA fellows","Best British Screenplay BAFTA Award winners","Best Screenplay BAFTA Award winners","Booker authors' division","British anthologists","British male essayists","British male television writers","British media critics","British psychological fiction writers","Burials at Kensal Green Cemetery","Commanders of the Order of the British Empire","David Cohen Prize recipients","Deaths from cancer in England","Deaths from liver cancer","English Ashkenazi Jews","English Jewish writers","English Nobel laureates","English activists","English anti-war activists","English anti\u2013Iraq War activists","English anti\u2013nuclear weapons activists","English atheists","English conscientious objectors","English essayists","English film directors","English human rights activists","English literary critics","English male dramatists and playwrights","English male film actors","English male non-fiction writers","English male novelists","English male poets","English male screenwriters","English male short story writers","English male stage actors","English male television actors","English pacifists","English people of Polish-Jewish descent","English people of Ukrainian-Jewish descent","English political writers","English radio writers","English social justice activists","English socialists","English sociologists","English television directors","English television writers","English theatre directors","Fellows of the Royal Society of Literature","Foreign members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts","Free speech activists","Harold Pinter","Jewish English activists","Jewish English male actors","Jewish atheists","Jewish dramatists and playwrights","Laurence Olivier Award winners","Lecturers","Literacy and society theorists","Literary theorists","Mass media theorists","Members of the Academy of Arts, Berlin","Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour","Members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts","Nobel laureates in Literature","PEN International","People associated with Queen Mary University of London","People educated at Hackney Downs School","People from Lower Clapton","Recipients of the Legion of Honour","Rhetoric theorists","Sociologists of art","Surrealist writers","The arts and politics","Theatre of the Absurd","Theatre theorists","Theatrologists","Tony Award winners","Writers about activism and social change","Writers about globalization","Writers from Hackney Central","Writers of historical fiction set in the early modern period","Writers of historical fiction set in the modern age"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 12\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

Pinter believed an aunt's erroneous view that the family was Sephardic and had fled the Spanish Inquisition; thus, for his early poems, Pinter used the pseudonym Pinta and at other times used variations such as da Pinto. Later research by Lady Antonia Fraser, Pinter's second wife, revealed the legend to be apocryphal; three of Pinter's grandparents came from Poland and the fourth from Odesa, so the family was Ashkenazic.\n\nPinter's family home in London is described by his official biographer Michael Billington as \"a solid, red-brick, three-storey villa just off the noisy, bustling, traffic-ridden thoroughfare of the Lower Clapton Road\". In 1940 and 1941, after the Blitz, Pinter was evacuated from their house in London to Cornwall and Reading. Billington states that the \"life-and-death intensity of daily experience\" before and during the Blitz left Pinter with profound memories \"of loneliness, bewilderment, separation and loss: themes that are in all his works.\"\n\nPinter discovered his social potential as a student at Hackney Downs School, a London grammar school, between 1944 and 1948. \"Partly through the school and partly through the social life of Hackney Boys' Club ... he formed an almost sacerdotal belief in the power of male friendship. The friends he made in those days \u2013 most particularly Henry Woolf, Michael (Mick) Goldstein and Morris (Moishe) Wernick \u2013 have always been a vital part of the emotional texture of his life.\" A major influence on Pinter was his inspirational English teacher Joseph Brearley, who directed him in school plays and with whom he took long walks, talking about literature. According to Billington, under Brearley's instruction, \"Pinter shone at English, wrote for the school magazine and discovered a gift for acting.\" In 1947 and 1948, he played Romeo and Macbeth in productions directed by Brearley.\n\nAt the age of 12, Pinter began writing poetry, and in spring 1947, his poetry was first published in the Hackney Downs School Magazine. In 1950 his poetry was first published outside the school magazine, in Poetry London, some of it under the pseudonym \"Harold Pinta\".\n\nPinter was an atheist.\n\n","h_score":2032711.5750000002,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":89530,"revid":1172856322,"description":"English playwright (1930\u20132008)","categories":["1930 births","2008 deaths","20th-century British dramatists and playwrights","20th-century British essayists","20th-century British novelists","20th-century British poets","20th-century British screenwriters","20th-century British short story writers","20th-century atheists","20th-century letter writers","21st-century British dramatists and playwrights","21st-century British essayists","21st-century British non-fiction writers","21st-century British poets","21st-century British screenwriters","21st-century British short story writers","21st-century atheists","Alumni of RADA","Alumni of the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama","BAFTA fellows","Best British Screenplay BAFTA Award winners","Best Screenplay BAFTA Award winners","Booker authors' division","British anthologists","British male essayists","British male television writers","British media critics","British psychological fiction writers","Burials at Kensal Green Cemetery","Commanders of the Order of the British Empire","David Cohen Prize recipients","Deaths from cancer in England","Deaths from liver cancer","English Ashkenazi Jews","English Jewish writers","English Nobel laureates","English activists","English anti-war activists","English anti\u2013Iraq War activists","English anti\u2013nuclear weapons activists","English atheists","English conscientious objectors","English essayists","English film directors","English human rights activists","English literary critics","English male dramatists and playwrights","English male film actors","English male non-fiction writers","English male novelists","English male poets","English male screenwriters","English male short story writers","English male stage actors","English male television actors","English pacifists","English people of Polish-Jewish descent","English people of Ukrainian-Jewish descent","English political writers","English radio writers","English social justice activists","English socialists","English sociologists","English television directors","English television writers","English theatre directors","Fellows of the Royal Society of Literature","Foreign members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts","Free speech activists","Harold Pinter","Jewish English activists","Jewish English male actors","Jewish atheists","Jewish dramatists and playwrights","Laurence Olivier Award winners","Lecturers","Literacy and society theorists","Literary theorists","Mass media theorists","Members of the Academy of Arts, Berlin","Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour","Members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts","Nobel laureates in Literature","PEN International","People associated with Queen Mary University of London","People educated at Hackney Downs School","People from Lower Clapton","Recipients of the Legion of Honour","Rhetoric theorists","Sociologists of art","Surrealist writers","The arts and politics","Theatre of the Absurd","Theatre theorists","Theatrologists","Tony Award winners","Writers about activism and social change","Writers about globalization","Writers from Hackney Central","Writers of historical fiction set in the early modern period","Writers of historical fiction set in the modern age"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 12\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

His parents were Seraf\u00edn Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn Ochoa and Ana Mar\u00eda Foulkes. His father was of Galician and German descent, and his mother was the daughter of Welsh immigrant Ricardo Foulkes and Falkland Islander Mar\u00eda Elena Ford. Following his elementary schooling, Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn enrolled at the General San Mart\u00edn Military Lyceum, graduating after five years as a second lieutenant. He did not pursue a military career, and began studying law instead. He began his studies at the National University of La Plata, and completed them at the University of Buenos Aires, graduating at the age of 23. He married Mar\u00eda Lorenza Barreneche, whom he met in the 1940s at a masquerade ball, in 1949. They moved to Mendoza, La Plata, and returned to Chascom\u00fas. They had six sons, of whom only Ricardo Alfons\u00edn would also follow a political career. Alfons\u00edn bought a local newspaper (El Imparcial). He joined the Radical Civic Union (UCR) in 1946, as a member of the Intransigent Renewal Movement, a faction of the party that opposed the incorporation of the UCR into the Democratic Union coalition. He was appointed president of the party committee in Chascom\u00fas in 1951 and was elected to the city council in 1954. He was detained for a brief time, during the reaction of the government of Juan Per\u00f3n to the bombing of Plaza de Mayo. The Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora ousted Per\u00f3n from the national government; Alfons\u00edn was again briefly detained and forced to leave his office in the city council. The UCR broke up into two parties: the Intransigent Radical Civic Union (UCRI), led by Arturo Frondizi, and the People's Radical Civic Union (UCRP), led by Ricardo Balb\u00edn and Cris\u00f3logo Larralde. Alfons\u00edn did not like the split but opted to follow the UCRP. Alfons\u00edn was elected deputy for the legislature of the Buenos Aires province in 1958, on the UCRP ticket, and was reelected in 1962. He moved to La Plata, capital of the province, during his tenure. President Frondizi was ousted by a military coup on 29 March 1962, which also closed the provincial legislature. Alfons\u00edn returned to Chascom\u00fas. The UCRP prevailed over the UCRI the following year, leading to the presidency of Arturo Umberto Illia. Alfons\u00edn was elected a national deputy, and then vice president of the UCRP bloc in the congress. In 1963 he was appointed president of the party committee for the province of Buenos Aires. Illia was deposed by a new military coup in June 1966, the Argentine Revolution.","h_score":1875446.0875000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":339517,"revid":1173494442,"description":"President of Argentina from 1983 to 1989","categories":["1927 births","2009 deaths","20th-century Argentine lawyers","20th-century Argentine politicians","Argentine Roman Catholics","Argentine people of Falkland Islands descent","Argentine people of Galician descent","Argentine people of German descent","Argentine people of Spanish descent","Argentine people of Welsh descent","Articles containing video clips","Burials at La Recoleta Cemetery","Collars of the Order of Isabella the Catholic","Deaths from lung cancer in Argentina","Illustrious Citizens of Buenos Aires","Members of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies elected in Buenos Aires Province","Members of the Argentine Senate for Buenos Aires Province","National University of La Plata alumni","People from Chascom\u00fas","Presidents of Argentina","Radical Civic Union politicians"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: Who was Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn?  \nA1: He was an Argentine politician and lawyer who served as president from 1983 to 1989.\n\nQ2: When and where was he born?  \nA2: He was born on March 12, 1927, in Chascom\u00fas, Argentina.\n\nQ3: What was his main political party?  \nA3: He belonged to the Radical Civic Union party.\n\nQ4: How did he become president?  \nA4: He won the 1983 elections, ending the military dictatorship.\n\nQ5: What key reforms did he pursue?  \nA5: He prosecuted military leaders for human rights abuses and promoted democracy.\n\nQ6: What challenges did he face?  \nA6: His administration dealt with hyperinflation and economic instability.\n\nQ7: How did his presidency end?  \nA7: He completed his term in 1989, handing over power peacefully.\n\nQ8: What is his legacy?  \nA8: He is remembered for restoring democracy and upholding human rights in Argentina."}

Born in Chascom\u00fas, Buenos Aires Province, Alfons\u00edn began his studies of law at the National University of La Plata and was a graduate of the University of Buenos Aires. He was affiliated with the Radical Civic Union (UCR), joining the faction of Ricardo Balb\u00edn after the party split. He was elected a deputy in the legislature of the Buenos Aires province in 1958, during the presidency of Arturo Frondizi, and a national deputy during the presidency of Arturo Umberto Illia. He opposed both sides of the Dirty War, and several times filed a writ of Habeas corpus, requesting the freedom of victims of forced disappearances, during the National Reorganization Process. He denounced the crimes of the military dictatorships of other countries and opposed the actions of both sides in the Falklands War as well. He became the leader of the UCR after Balb\u00edn's death and was the Radical candidate for the presidency in the 1983 elections, which he won. After becoming president, Alfons\u00edn sent a bill to Congress to revoke the self-amnesty law established by the military. He established the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons to investigate the crimes committed by the military, which led to the Trial of the Juntas and resulted in the sentencing of the heads of the former regime. Discontent within the military led to the mutinies of the Carapintadas, leading him to appease them with the full stop law and the law of Due Obedience. He also had conflicts with the unions, which were controlled by the opposing Justicialist Party. He resolved the Beagle conflict, increased trade with Brazil, and proposed the creation of the Contadora support group to mediate between the United States and Nicaragua.

The resulting hyperinflation and riots led to his party's defeat in the 1989 presidential elections, which was won by Peronist Carlos Menem. Alfons\u00edn continued as the leader of the UCR and opposed the presidency of Carlos Menem. He initiated the Pact of Olivos with Menem in order to negotiate the terms for the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution.

Following de la R\u00faa's resignation during the December 2001 riots, Alfons\u00edn's faction provided the support needed for the Peronist Eduardo Duhalde to be appointed president by the Congress.

Lieutenant Colonel Aldo Rico started another mutiny at Campo de Mayo, supporting Barreiro. The rebels were called \"Carapintadas\" (Spanish: \"Painted faces\") because of their use of military camouflage. The CGT called a general strike in support of Alfons\u00edn, and large masses rallied in the Plaza de Mayo to support the government. Alfons\u00edn negotiated directly with the rebels and secured their surrender. He announced the end of the crisis from the balcony of the Casa Rosada. The mutineers eventually surrendered, but the government proceeded with the Law of Due Obedience to regulate the trials. However, the timing of both events was exploited by the military, and the opposition parties described the outcome as a surrender by Alfons\u00edn. Aldo Rico escaped from prison in January 1988 and started a new mutiny in a distant regiment in the northeast. This time, both the military support for the mutiny and the public outcry against it were minimal. The army attacked him, and Rico surrendered after a brief combat. Colonel Mohamed Al\u00ed Seineld\u00edn launched a new mutiny in late 1988. As in 1987, the mutineers were defeated and jailed, but the military was reluctant to open fire against them. Alfons\u00edn's goal of reconciling the military with the civil population failed, as the latter rejected the military's complaints, and the military was focused on internal issues. The Movimiento Todos por la Patria, a small guerrilla army led by Enrique Gorriar\u00e1n Merlo, staged the attack on the Regiment of La Tablada in 1989. The army killed many of their members, and quickly defeated the uprising.","h_score":1875446.0875000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":339517,"revid":1173494442,"description":"President of Argentina from 1983 to 1989","categories":["1927 births","2009 deaths","20th-century Argentine lawyers","20th-century Argentine politicians","Argentine Roman Catholics","Argentine people of Falkland Islands descent","Argentine people of Galician descent","Argentine people of German descent","Argentine people of Spanish descent","Argentine people of Welsh descent","Articles containing video clips","Burials at La Recoleta Cemetery","Collars of the Order of Isabella the Catholic","Deaths from lung cancer in Argentina","Illustrious Citizens of Buenos Aires","Members of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies elected in Buenos Aires Province","Members of the Argentine Senate for Buenos Aires Province","National University of La Plata alumni","People from Chascom\u00fas","Presidents of Argentina","Radical Civic Union politicians"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn: Argentina's Democratic Trailblazer\n\nRa\u00fal Alfons\u00edn served as President of Argentina from 1983 to 1989, leading the nation out of military dictatorship.

Fernando de la R\u00faa, who would have run in the primary elections against him, declined his candidacy because of Alfons\u00edn's huge popularity. The publicity was managed by David Ratto, who created the slogan \"Ahora Alfons\u00edn\" (Spanish: \"Now Alfons\u00edn\"), and the gesture of the shaking hands. His campaign used a non-confrontational approach, in stark contrast with the Peronist candidate for the governorship of the Buenos Aires province, Herminio Iglesias. Iglesias burned a coffin with the seals of the UCR on live television, which generated a political scandal. Both Iglesias and \u00cdtalo Luder, the Peronist candidate to the presidency, saw a decrease in their public image as a result.\n\nDuring the campaign, both parties made similar proposals to reduce authoritarianism and the political influence of the military, and to maintain the Argentine claim in the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute. Alfons\u00edn denounced a pact between the military and the Peronist unions that sought an amnesty for the military. He maintained that the armed forces should be subject to the civilian government and that unions should be regulated. He also proposed an investigation into the actions of the military during the Dirty War. He closed his campaign by reading the preamble of the constitution of Argentina.

His parents were Seraf\u00edn Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn Ochoa and Ana Mar\u00eda Foulkes. His father was of Galician and German descent, and his mother was the daughter of Welsh immigrant Ricardo Foulkes and Falkland Islander Mar\u00eda Elena Ford. Following his elementary schooling, Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn enrolled at the General San Mart\u00edn Military Lyceum, graduating after five years as a second lieutenant. He did not pursue a military career, and began studying law instead. He began his studies at the National University of La Plata, and completed them at the University of Buenos Aires, graduating at the age of 23. He married Mar\u00eda Lorenza Barreneche, whom he met in the 1940s at a masquerade ball, in 1949. They moved to Mendoza, La Plata, and returned to Chascom\u00fas. They had six sons, of whom only Ricardo Alfons\u00edn would also follow a political career. Alfons\u00edn bought a local newspaper (El Imparcial). He joined the Radical Civic Union (UCR) in 1946, as a member of the Intransigent Renewal Movement, a faction of the party that opposed the incorporation of the UCR into the Democratic Union coalition. He was appointed president of the party committee in Chascom\u00fas in 1951 and was elected to the city council in 1954. He was detained for a brief time, during the reaction of the government of Juan Per\u00f3n to the bombing of Plaza de Mayo. The Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora ousted Per\u00f3n from the national government; Alfons\u00edn was again briefly detained and forced to leave his office in the city council. The UCR broke up into two parties: the Intransigent Radical Civic Union (UCRI), led by Arturo Frondizi, and the People's Radical Civic Union (UCRP), led by Ricardo Balb\u00edn and Cris\u00f3logo Larralde. Alfons\u00edn did not like the split but opted to follow the UCRP. Alfons\u00edn was elected deputy for the legislature of the Buenos Aires province in 1958, on the UCRP ticket, and was reelected in 1962. He moved to La Plata, capital of the province, during his tenure. President Frondizi was ousted by a military coup on 29 March 1962, which also closed the provincial legislature. Alfons\u00edn returned to Chascom\u00fas. The UCRP prevailed over the UCRI the following year, leading to the presidency of Arturo Umberto Illia. Alfons\u00edn was elected a national deputy, and then vice president of the UCRP bloc in the congress. In 1963 he was appointed president of the party committee for the province of Buenos Aires. Illia was deposed by a new military coup in June 1966, the Argentine Revolution.","h_score":1875446.0875000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":339517,"revid":1173494442,"description":"President of Argentina from 1983 to 1989","categories":["1927 births","2009 deaths","20th-century Argentine lawyers","20th-century Argentine politicians","Argentine Roman Catholics","Argentine people of Falkland Islands descent","Argentine people of Galician descent","Argentine people of German descent","Argentine people of Spanish descent","Argentine people of Welsh descent","Articles containing video clips","Burials at La Recoleta Cemetery","Collars of the Order of Isabella the Catholic","Deaths from lung cancer in Argentina","Illustrious Citizens of Buenos Aires","Members of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies elected in Buenos Aires Province","Members of the Argentine Senate for Buenos Aires Province","National University of La Plata alumni","People from Chascom\u00fas","Presidents of Argentina","Radical Civic Union politicians"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn: Argentina's Fiery Democratic Spark\n\nRa\u00fal Alfons\u00edn, Argentina's president from 1983 to 1989, spearheaded the nation's return to democracy after a brutal military dictatorship.

Lieutenant Colonel Aldo Rico started another mutiny at Campo de Mayo, supporting Barreiro. The rebels were called \"Carapintadas\" (Spanish: \"Painted faces\") because of their use of military camouflage. The CGT called a general strike in support of Alfons\u00edn, and large masses rallied in the Plaza de Mayo to support the government. Alfons\u00edn negotiated directly with the rebels and secured their surrender. He announced the end of the crisis from the balcony of the Casa Rosada. The mutineers eventually surrendered, but the government proceeded with the Law of Due Obedience to regulate the trials. However, the timing of both events was exploited by the military, and the opposition parties described the outcome as a surrender by Alfons\u00edn. Aldo Rico escaped from prison in January 1988 and started a new mutiny in a distant regiment in the northeast. This time, both the military support for the mutiny and the public outcry against it were minimal. The army attacked him, and Rico surrendered after a brief combat. Colonel Mohamed Al\u00ed Seineld\u00edn launched a new mutiny in late 1988. As in 1987, the mutineers were defeated and jailed, but the military was reluctant to open fire against them. Alfons\u00edn's goal of reconciling the military with the civil population failed, as the latter rejected the military's complaints, and the military was focused on internal issues. The Movimiento Todos por la Patria, a small guerrilla army led by Enrique Gorriar\u00e1n Merlo, staged the attack on the Regiment of La Tablada in 1989. The army killed many of their members, and quickly defeated the uprising.","h_score":1875446.0875000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":339517,"revid":1173494442,"description":"President of Argentina from 1983 to 1989","categories":["1927 births","2009 deaths","20th-century Argentine lawyers","20th-century Argentine politicians","Argentine Roman Catholics","Argentine people of Falkland Islands descent","Argentine people of Galician descent","Argentine people of German descent","Argentine people of Spanish descent","Argentine people of Welsh descent","Articles containing video clips","Burials at La Recoleta Cemetery","Collars of the Order of Isabella the Catholic","Deaths from lung cancer in Argentina","Illustrious Citizens of Buenos Aires","Members of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies elected in Buenos Aires Province","Members of the Argentine Senate for Buenos Aires Province","National University of La Plata alumni","People from Chascom\u00fas","Presidents of Argentina","Radical Civic Union politicians"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: Grade 10\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

He was forced to resign as a deputy in November 1966. He was detained a third time in 1968 after a political rally in La Plata. He also wrote opinion articles in newspapers, under the pseudonyms Alfonso Carrido Lura and Seraf\u00edn Feij\u00f3. The Dirty War began during this time, as many guerrilla groups rejected both the right-wing military dictatorship and the civil governments, preferring instead a left-wing dictatorship aligned with the Soviet Union, as in the Cuban Revolution. Alfons\u00edn clarified in his articles that he rejected both the military dictatorship and the guerrillas, asking instead for free elections. The UCRP became the UCR once more, and the UCRI was turned into the Intransigent Party. Alfons\u00edn created the Movement for Renewal and Change within the UCR, to challenge Balb\u00edn's leadership of the party. The military dictatorship finally called for free elections, allowing Peronism (which had been banned since 1955) to take part in them. Balb\u00edn defeated Alfons\u00edn in the primary elections but lost in the main ones. Alfons\u00edn was elected deputy once more. Illia was invited in 1975 to a diplomatic mission to the Soviet Union; he declined and proposed Alfons\u00edn instead. Upon his return, Alfons\u00edn became one of the founding members of the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights. He served as the defense lawyer for Mario Roberto Santucho, leader of the ERP guerrillas, but only to carry out due process of law, and not because of a genuine desire to support him. The 1976 Argentine coup d'\u00e9tat against President Isabel Per\u00f3n started the National Reorganization Process. Alfons\u00edn filed several Habeas corpus motions, requesting the freedom of victims of forced disappearances. He also visited other countries, denouncing those disappearances and violations of human rights. He established the magazine Propuesta y control in 1976, one of the few magazines that criticized the military dictatorship during its early stages. The magazine was published up to 1978. His editorials were collected in 1980 in the book La cuesti\u00f3n argentina. He expressed opposition to the 1982 Falklands War, criticizing the deployment of troops by both sides during the conflict. The Argentine defeat in the war marked the decline of the military dictatorship. The main political parties united in the Multipartidaria, issuing a joint request to the dictatorship to call for elections. Alfons\u00edn proposed the appointment of Arturo Illia as the head of state of a transition government, similar to the Metapolitefsi in Greece. The Movement for Renewal and Change took control of the UCR; Balb\u00edn had died the previous year.","h_score":1875446.0875000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":339517,"revid":1173494442,"description":"President of Argentina from 1983 to 1989","categories":["1927 births","2009 deaths","20th-century Argentine lawyers","20th-century Argentine politicians","Argentine Roman Catholics","Argentine people of Falkland Islands descent","Argentine people of Galician descent","Argentine people of German descent","Argentine people of Spanish descent","Argentine people of Welsh descent","Articles containing video clips","Burials at La Recoleta Cemetery","Collars of the Order of Isabella the Catholic","Deaths from lung cancer in Argentina","Illustrious Citizens of Buenos Aires","Members of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies elected in Buenos Aires Province","Members of the Argentine Senate for Buenos Aires Province","National University of La Plata alumni","People from Chascom\u00fas","Presidents of Argentina","Radical Civic Union politicians"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 10\n\n**Learning Objectives:**\n1.

The British government had temporarily prohibited all foreign ships from entering the exclusion zone of the islands in 1986. Argentina organised air and marine patrols, as well as military maneuvers in the Patagonia. However, this was not enough to placate the military hard-liners in Argentina. Alfons\u00edn proposed the postponement the sovereignty discussions, instead negotiating for a de jure cease of hostilities, with a reduction in the number of military forces and a normalization of Argentina\u2013United Kingdom relations. The United Kingdom did not trust the proposal, suspecting that it was a cover-up for sovereignty discussions.\n\nThe Beagle conflict was still an unresolved problem with Chile, despite the 1978 Papal mediation. The military, troubled by the trial of the juntas, called for rejection of the proposed agreement and a continuation of the country's claim over the islands. Alfons\u00edn called for a referendum to settle the dispute. Despite opposition from the military and the Justicialist party, who called for abstention, support for the resolution referendum reached 82%. The bill passed in the Senate by a single vote majority, as the PJ maintained its resistance. The Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina was signed the following year, ending the conflict. The human rights violations committed by the Chilean president Augusto Pinochet remained a contentious issue, as well as the revelation of Chilean assistance to British forces during the Falklands War. The Argentine church invited Pope John Paul II for a second visit to Argentina in 1987, to celebrate his successful mediation. He celebrated World Youth Day next to the Obelisk of Buenos Aires, and gave a mass at the Basilica of Our Lady of Luj\u00e1n.\n\nArgentina allied with Brazil, Uruguay and Peru, three countries that had also recently ended their local military dictatorships, to mediate in the conflict between the United States and Nicaragua. They created the Contadora support group, to support the Contadora group from South America. Both groups negotiated together, but ultimately failed because of the reluctance of both Nicaragua and the United States to change their positions. The group changed its scope later to discuss foreign debt and diplomacy with the United Kingdom in relation to the Falklands conflict.\n\nInitially, Alfons\u00edn refused to foster diplomatic relations with the Brazilian military government, and only did so when the dictatorship ended and Jos\u00e9 Sarney became president. One of their initial concerns was to increase Argentine\u2013Brazilian trade. Both presidents met in Foz do Igua\u00e7u and issued a joint declaration about the peaceful use of nuclear power. A second meeting in Buenos Aires strengthened the trade agreements. Argentina and Brazil signed the Program of Integration and Economic Cooperation (PICE), and in 1988 both countries and Uruguay agreed to create a common market. This led to the 1991 Treaty of Asunci\u00f3n, that created the Mercosur.\n\nAlfons\u00edn was the first Argentine head of state to give an official visit to USSR.\n\n","h_score":1875446.0875000001,"h_score_cat":9,"pageid":339517,"revid":1173494442,"description":"President of Argentina from 1983 to 1989","categories":["1927 births","2009 deaths","20th-century Argentine lawyers","20th-century Argentine politicians","Argentine Roman Catholics","Argentine people of Falkland Islands descent","Argentine people of Galician descent","Argentine people of German descent","Argentine people of Spanish descent","Argentine people of Welsh descent","Articles containing video clips","Burials at La Recoleta Cemetery","Collars of the Order of Isabella the Catholic","Deaths from lung cancer in Argentina","Illustrious Citizens of Buenos Aires","Members of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies elected in Buenos Aires Province","Members of the Argentine Senate for Buenos Aires Province","National University of La Plata alumni","People from Chascom\u00fas","Presidents of Argentina","Radical Civic Union politicians"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 11\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

The race was first held in 1829, and since 1845 has taken place on the 4.2-mile (6.8 km) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London. The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and, as of 2014, broadcast worldwide. Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions, having won the 1934 race by four and a quarter lengths, and led overall with 45 victories to Oxford's 40 (excluding the \"dead heat\" of 1877).\n\nCambridge's coaches were D. H. E. McCowen (who had rowed in the 1932 race) and, according to the rowing correspondent for The Times, \"two eminent Metropolitan coaches\" in R. A. Nisbet and C. H. Rew. Oxford were coached by Francis Escombe and Peter Haig-Thomas, both of whom previously coached the Light Blues, and former Light Blue rower Kenneth Payne (who rowed for Cambridge in the 1932 and 1934 races). The race was umpired by former Oxford rower and boat club president Robert Bourne who had stroked the Dark Blues to four consecutive victories between 1909 and 1912, while the finishing judge was C. W. Kent. Both boats were made by Sims and both crews used Ayling's oars.\n\nThe rowing correspondent for The Times noted that \"neither crew is exceptionally fast\" and suggested that Oxford's heavier crew would out-perform Cambridge, who he claimed \"will be seen at their best in calm conditions\". As a result of Oxford's practice rows during the period running up to the race, former Dark Blue rower E. P. Evans, writing in The Manchester Guardian, stated \"Cambridge are now at the zenith of their power and are not likely to improve, whilst Oxford are still in the stages of reaching perfection\".\n\n ## Crews\n\nThe Oxford crew weighed an average of 12 st 13 lb (81.9 kg), 4.375 pounds (2.0 kg) per rower more than their opponents. Cambridge saw four participants with Boat Race experience return to the crew, including cox Noel Duckworth. The Light Blue crew also included a pair of brothers in Annesely and Desmond Kingsford. Oxford's crew also contained four former Blues, including P. R. S. Bankes and John Couchman, both of whom were rowing in their third consecutive race. All of the race participants were registered as British.\n\n","h_score":1356522.40625,"h_score_cat":1,"pageid":42988751,"revid":1081894423,"description":null,"categories":["1935 in English sport","1935 in rowing","1935 sports events in London","April 1935 sports events","The Boat Race"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's the Boat Race all about?  \nA1: It's an epic Oxford vs. Cambridge rowing showdown on the Thames, a tradition since 1829.  \n\nQ2: When did the 1935 race happen?  \nA2: It splashed down on March 30, 1935, amid roaring crowds and choppy waters.  \n\nQ3: Who rowed in that legendary clash?  \nA3: Oxford and Cambridge crews battled, with Oxford's team featuring future stars.  \n\nQ4: Did Oxford or Cambridge win?  \nA4: Oxford triumphed by three lengths, etching a gritty victory in history.  \n\nQ5: Were there any dramatic twists?  \nA5: Fog nearly derailed the start, adding tense, shadowy intrigue to the duel.  \n\nQ6: How did it compare to past races?  \nA6: It was fiercer than usual, with faster times amid economic gloom of the 1930s.  \n\nQ7: What made 1935 stand out?  \nA7: Rising nationalism flavored the event, turning it into a vivid symbol of British spirit.  \n\nQ8: What's its lasting ripple?  \nA8: It fueled rowing's global allure, a playful yet profound echo in modern sports lore."}

Everton's near neighbours Liverpool complained to the League that the game adversely affected the attendance at their home fixture with Newcastle, but the League confirmed that Everton were within their rights to arrange the match. \"Better forward play [had] rarely been witnessed at Lincoln than that shown by Small Heath\" in a 5\u20132 defeat of Lincoln City, whose defence failed to cope with the industry and creativity of Teddy Jolley feeding the \"light but nimble\" forwards, Mobley in particular. The next weekend, numerous matches were postponed or abandoned because of the weather. Although the Small Heath and Crewe Alexandra players were changed and ready to play, the referee would not start the game because the \"blinding snowstorm would prevent him from having a proper sight of the play\".\n\nAdvertised as a \"Grand League Match\" in the local paper \u2013 vying for attention with the forthcoming Sailors' Bazaar, a Boys' Brigade band concert and a clearance sale of squirrel-tail fur boas \u2013 Small Heath's visit to Middlesbrough Ironopolis failed to live up to the billing. A storm that cost hundreds of lives at sea had left the Paradise Ground with damaged railings and grandstand blown down, and only a few hundred spectators stood in the pouring rain to see the home side produce a surprise victory by three goals to nil on a sodden pitch. The Leicester Chronicle feared \"that last year's second division champions are far from being what they were\", having dropped as many points already as in the whole of the previous season.\n\n","h_score":1203630.1000000001,"h_score_cat":0,"pageid":31311332,"revid":1147449107,"description":null,"categories":["Birmingham City F.C. seasons","English football clubs 1893\u201394 season"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What was Small Heath F.C. in 1893\u201394?  \nA1: Small Heath F.C. was a Birmingham-based football club, the predecessor to Birmingham City F.C., competing in the Football League.  \n\nQ2: Which league did they play in that season?  \nA2: They competed in the Second Division of the Football League.  \n\nQ3: What was their overall record?  \nA3: They won the Second Division title with a strong performance, earning promotion.  \n\nQ4: Did they face any notable challenges?  \nA4: The team dealt with typical competition but overcame it to succeed.  \n\nQ5: Who were key players?  \nA5: Players like Caesar Jenkyns and others contributed significantly to their wins.  \n\nQ6: How did they compare to previous seasons?  \nA6: This season showed improvement, building on earlier experiences in the league.  \n\nQ7: What was the impact of their success?  \nA7: Winning led to promotion and greater recognition for the club.  \n\nQ8: What is the legacy of that season?  \nA8: It marked a key milestone in the club's history and development."}

Charles Partridge, making his Football League debut after Hollis was taken ill, played behind an experimental defensive pairing of half-back Ted Devey and reserve-team player George Short. Despite the scoreline, the Nottinghamshire Guardian described them as \"a very useful pair of backs\", although not up to the home team's standard, and the Daily Post rated Devey as \"easily the best left-back the club have played this season\". Two of Notts' goals were fortunate: an attempted clearance by Devey ricocheted off Jenkyns' head for their second goal, and for their third, the ball appeared to be heading safely over the crossbar until caught by a gust of wind.\n\nEight Midlands clubs formed a league to be played as a supplementary competition to fill vacant dates in the season without the trouble and expense of arranging friendly matches, later joined by Small Heath and Notts County. Small Heath's first four matches in this United Counties League were played in February. After \"a creditable draw\" at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers of the First Division, they \"thoroughly deserved\" to win the return match 2\u20131. West Bromwich Albion took a 5\u20131 lead in the first half at Coventry Road, yet in the second, the Small Heath forwards raised their level of performance, scored three times without reply, and were unfortunate not to secure a draw. Two days later, the First Division club won the return match at Stoney Lane rather more comfortably.\n\nThe committee organised a public meeting at which chairman Walter Hart bemoaned the poor attendances, which he felt would not improve unless the team were promoted to the First Division, mentioned that the club had rejected a \"big offer from a neighbouring club for the release of a prominent player\", and called for \u00a3200 to be raised to bring in players to strengthen the team's defence. A collection in the hall raised cash and pledges to the value of \u00a342 10s, and supporters contributed generously to the public appeal. An attempt to sign full-back Jack Oliver from Middlesbrough Ironopolis was unsuccessful, and the club offered the services of goalkeeper Chris Charsley to Aston Villa.\n\n","h_score":1203630.1000000001,"h_score_cat":0,"pageid":31311332,"revid":1147449107,"description":null,"categories":["Birmingham City F.C. seasons","English football clubs 1893\u201394 season"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What was Small Heath F.C. in 1893\u201394?  \nA1: Small Heath F.C., based in Birmingham, England, was a professional football club competing in the Second Division, laying groundwork for modern Birmingham City.  \n\nQ2: When did the season occur?  \nA2: The 1893\u201394 season spanned from September 1893 to April 1894, marking early Football League play.  \n\nQ3: How did the team perform overall?  \nA3: They won the Second Division title with 16 wins from 28 games, earning promotion and showcasing rising prowess.  \n\nQ4: Who were key players?  \nA4: Stars like Caesar Jenkyns and Fred Speller drove the attack, with Jenkyns netting crucial goals amid fierce rivalries.  \n\nQ5: What were major matches?  \nA5: Highlights included a decisive win over Burslem Port Vale and a tense draw with Grimsby Town, fueling their championship push.  \n\nQ6: What challenges did they face?  \nA6: Injuries and tough away games tested the squad, yet their resilience shone through in a gritty campaign.  \n\nQ7: How did the season impact the club?  \nA7: Promotion boosted morale and finances, elevating Small Heath's status in English football's evolving landscape.  \n\nQ8: What is the season's historical significance?  \nA8: It symbolized early football growth, highlighting working-class spirit and paving the way for future successes in Birmingham's history."}

Wheldon scored four and Mobley three in an 8\u20130 win, and the goalscoring continued in midweek in the fixture postponed because of the snowstorm, as Small Heath beat a Crewe Alexandra side without several first-choice players by six goals to one. Burton Swifts proved more difficult opponents. On a heavy pitch, play was concentrated in the midfield area as the strength of both teams lay in their half backs, and Small Heath's winning goal came with ten minutes of the match remaining. It was reported that the club had turned down a big offer from First Division club Aston Villa for the services of Fred Wheldon. Newcastle United travelled to Birmingham on the Friday, to be fresh for Saturday's match, as Small Heath had done in the reverse fixture, and again, the tactic worked. Their forwards \"displayed excellent combination\", were \"splendidly supported by the half-backs\", and \"but for [Jenkyns'] untiring efforts matters would have been worse\" than the 4\u20131 defeat.\n\nChanges were made for the visit of Middlesbrough Ironopolis, Arthur Littleford, Charles Izon and Bernard Pumfrey coming in for Smith, Mobley and Jack Hallam. The half-backs were again the backbone of the team, and Wheldon, who produced \"a brilliant exposition of dodging and shooting\", scored the winning goal five minutes from time in what the Standard'''s reporter described as a \"rattling good game\". Fred Speller was reported to have \"not been seen in such form since his leg was broken last year\" in a Boxing Day friendly with top amateur club Marlow, the club from which he signed for Small Heath. Their last League match of 1893, a comfortable 6\u20130 victory against Lincoln City, took them into the new year in second place in the division, three points ahead of Notts County but two points behind Liverpool, who had played two fewer matches. Pumfrey strengthened the defence, George Hollis was as usual secure in goal, and the forwards, with the returning Mobley and the introduction of reserve-team player Walter Jackson, \"showed better combination and greater dash than they have recently done\".\n\n","h_score":1203630.1000000001,"h_score_cat":0,"pageid":31311332,"revid":1147449107,"description":null,"categories":["Birmingham City F.C. seasons","English football clubs 1893\u201394 season"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What was Small Heath F.C. in 1893\u201394?  \nA1: The spirited ancestors of Birmingham City, kicking through Victorian fog in their second Football League season.\n\nQ2: Which league did they play?  \nA2: The Second Division, a gritty battlefield of boots and ambition amid industrial England's roar.\n\nQ3: How did they fare overall?  \nA3: Mid-table scrappers, clinching respectable wins but dodging relegation's shadow with clever tactics.\n\nQ4: Who were key players?  \nA4: Unsung heroes like Fred Speller dazzled with goals, weaving vivid tales on muddy pitches.\n\nQ5: Any standout matches?  \nA5: A thrilling FA Cup clash against stronger foes, where underdogs nearly scripted an epic upset.\n\nQ6: What about wins and losses?  \nA6: Fourteen victories from 28 games, losses tempered by the era's raw, unyielding competition.\n\nQ7: How did it impact the club?  \nA7: Solidified their league footing, fueling future glory with lessons from dusty triumphs and defeats.\n\nQ8: Why remember this season?  \nA8: A quirky pivot in football's evolution, blending charm and chaos to shape Birmingham's enduring legacy."}

Despite the scoreline, the Nottinghamshire Guardian described them as \"a very useful pair of backs\", although not up to the home team's standard, and the Daily Post rated Devey as \"easily the best left-back the club have played this season\". Two of Notts' goals were fortunate: an attempted clearance by Devey ricocheted off Jenkyns' head for their second goal, and for their third, the ball appeared to be heading safely over the crossbar until caught by a gust of wind.\n\nEight Midlands clubs formed a league to be played as a supplementary competition to fill vacant dates in the season without the trouble and expense of arranging friendly matches, later joined by Small Heath and Notts County.

However, promotion to the First Division depended on the test match system, in which each of the lowest-ranked three teams from the First Division played off against one of the highest-ranked three from the Second Division. Small Heath lost to Newton Heath after a replay, so were not promoted. The League's Annual General Meeting heard proposals that the First Division be expanded to either 20 or 18 teams. Both motions were, unsurprisingly, seconded by Small Heath, but both were defeated, thus confirming that the team would play in the Second Division for the 1893\u201394 season. The Second Division championship shield was presented to the club at a meeting of the Football League held at the Colonnade Hotel in New Street, Birmingham, in August.\n\nOf the regular first-team members from the previous season, goalkeeper Chris Charsley, a serving police officer, was unavailable and full back Tom Bayley had been released. Fred Speller, who had suffered a badly broken leg early in the season, had been playing in practice matches and was believed to be back to full fitness. Fringe players Harry Edwards and Fred Jones had left the club, and Harry Morris had retired to concentrate on his plumbing business. Goalkeeper George Hollis, backs Arthur Littleford, Bernard Pumfrey and George Short, half-backs Ted Devey, Caesar Jenkyns, Teddy Jolley and Billy Ollis, and forwards Jack Hallam, Tommy Hands, Frank Mobley, Billy Walton and Fred Wheldon all remained with the club. Newcomers included forwards Jack Lee, Charles Izon and Walter Jackson, all signed from non-league clubs in the West Midlands area. Alfred Jones continued as secretary-manager, and Caesar Jenkyns retained the captaincy.

After the referee rejected the Liverpool players' claim that Small Heath's equaliser had entered the goal through a hole in the side netting, their play became rough, culminating in centre-half Joe McQue, a \"strapping fellow\", kicking Frank Mobley in the abdomen, apparently intentionally. While the referee was cautioning McQue, Small Heath captain Caesar Jenkyns rushed in, knocked McQue to the ground, and was sent off. With a man advantage, it still took Liverpool until the stroke of time to score the winning goal. The Posts reporter suggested that, despite the provocation, Jenkyns should not have reacted the way he did, but \"the knowledge that it cost his side the game\" was sufficient punishment. Despite the referee in his report agreeing that \"the punishment of being sent off would meet case\", and that Jenkyns had \"played a perfectly fair game\" and had expressed regret at his actions, both when dismissed and after the game, the Football Association imposed a four-week suspension, to begin on 31 October.\n\nIn the meantime the play of Jenkyns and his fellow half-backs was instrumental in a 4\u20131 defeat of Woolwich Arsenal. The first half hour was played \"in a spiritless fashion\", but then Wheldon scored \"a fine goal with one of his characteristic shots\", and the remainder of the game was one-sided. The Small Heath team prepared for their match at Newcastle United by taking the train as far as York on the Friday evening, which left only another 70 miles (110 km) for the day of the match. Contrary to expectation, Small Heath were successful in a \"hard game\", with the half-backs again influential despite Jenkyns receiving a \"nasty blow in the mouth\".

Hollis should have done better with Grimsby's opener, Frank Mobley was injured around the eye in collision with the goalkeeper when scoring Small Heath's only goal and showed some bravery in remaining on the field, and Wheldon had an apparently valid goal disallowed. Short, in a \"trifle risky\" style, and the solid Devey again did well in defence. Lost gate receipts because of Aston Villa's withdrawal from the United Counties League was decidedly unpopular with the other members, and the Small Heath committee arranged a smoking concert to raise funds. Those clubs at the bottom of the First Division and top of the Second were all recruiting new players: \"the test matches mean such a lot to the clubs concerned that there is no wonder at this anxiety to secure new blood.\" Small Heath acquired the services of full-backs Percy Watson and William Purves, from Rotherham Town and Irish club Glentoran respectively.\n\nThe Small Heath club staged a \"double-header\" the following Saturday. After the reserves beat Brierley Hill Alliance 3\u20130 in the Birmingham & District League, Watson made a promising debut at back as the first team played a friendly against a below-strength Nottingham Forest side. Charsley returned to first-team duty in a 10\u20132 demolition of Ardwick, whose goalkeeper arrived with his team already one goal behind. Mobley's fourth hat-trick gave him ten goals from his last six matches, taking him past the 20-goal mark for the season. A close game at Rotherham produced a 3\u20132 win, and against Burslem Port Vale, the Small Heath forwards had \"rarely been seen to greater advantage\" as they scored six without reply.\n\nThe semi-final of the Birmingham Charity Cup provided a break from League action. Mobley opened the scoring, but Wolverhampton Wanderers shot against the woodwork on several occasions and the visitors were \"singularly fortunate\" in restricting the home side to one goal, and that a penalty kick. With the scores level, a decision was made not to play extra time, and the replay was arranged for two weeks later at Coventry Road. In their penultimate match of the Football League season, Small Heath produced a good team performance to win 4\u20131 at Woolwich Arsenal and reach 100 League goals for the season. The forwards played a characteristic \"beautifully combined\" game, the half-backs, particularly Jenkyns, were too strong for the home forwards, Purves looked set to be the full-back the team had needed for some time, and Charsley \"kept goal exceedingly well\".\n\n","h_score":1203630.1000000001,"h_score_cat":0,"pageid":31311332,"revid":1147449107,"description":null,"categories":["Birmingham City F.C. seasons","English football clubs 1893\u201394 season"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade 8\n\n**Learning Objectives:**  \n1.

The cap attains a diameter of 1\u20131.3 cm (0.4\u20130.5 in). Its whitish surface is covered with small, reddish-brown, pressed-down scales that are more numerous in the center. The margin is initially curved inward, but straightens out in age, and retains hanging remnants of the partial veil. The gills are white, and free from attachment to the stem. They are crowded together, with two or three tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stem). Viewed with a hand lens, the edges of the gills appear to be fringed. The stem is cylindrical with a bulbous base, initially solid before becoming hollow, and measures 2.6\u20134.5 cm (1.0\u20131.8 in) long by 1\u20131.5 mm thick. The stem surface is whitish, but will stain a light brown color if handled. In young fruit bodies, the stems have a whitish, membranous ring on the upper half, but the ring does not last long before disintegrating. The flesh is thin (up to 1 mm), whitish, and lacks any appreciable odor.\n\nLepiota babruzalka produces a white spore print. Spores are roughly elliptical to somewhat cylindrical, hyaline (translucent), and measure 5.5\u201310.5 by 3.5\u20134.5 \u03bcm. They are thick-walled and contain a refractive oil droplet. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, hyaline, and are one- to four-spored with sterigmata up to 8 \u03bcm long; the dimensions of the basidia are 15\u201320 by 7\u20138 \u03bcm. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the edge of the gill) are plentiful, and can assume a number of shapes, including cylindrical to club-shaped, utriform (like a wineskin bottle), to ventricose-rostrate (where the basal and middle portions are swollen and the apex extends into a beak-like protrusion). The cheilocystidia are thin-walled, and measure 13\u201332 by 7\u201312 \u03bcm; there are no cystidia on the gill faces (pleurocystidia).\n\nThe gill tissue is made of thin-walled hyphae containing a septum, which are hyaline to pale yellow, and measure 3\u201315 \u03bcm wide. The cap tissue comprises interwoven, inflated hyphae with widths between 2 and 25 \u03bcm. Neither the gill tissue nor the cap tissue show any color reaction when stained with Melzer's reagent.

The cap attains a diameter of 1\u20131.3 cm (0.4\u20130.5 in). Its whitish surface is covered with small, reddish-brown, pressed-down scales that are more numerous in the center. The margin is initially curved inward, but straightens out in age, and retains hanging remnants of the partial veil. The gills are white, and free from attachment to the stem. They are crowded together, with two or three tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stem). Viewed with a hand lens, the edges of the gills appear to be fringed. The stem is cylindrical with a bulbous base, initially solid before becoming hollow, and measures 2.6\u20134.5 cm (1.0\u20131.8 in) long by 1\u20131.5 mm thick. The stem surface is whitish, but will stain a light brown color if handled. In young fruit bodies, the stems have a whitish, membranous ring on the upper half, but the ring does not last long before disintegrating. The flesh is thin (up to 1 mm), whitish, and lacks any appreciable odor.\n\nLepiota babruzalka produces a white spore print. Spores are roughly elliptical to somewhat cylindrical, hyaline (translucent), and measure 5.5\u201310.5 by 3.5\u20134.5 \u03bcm. They are thick-walled and contain a refractive oil droplet. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, hyaline, and are one- to four-spored with sterigmata up to 8 \u03bcm long; the dimensions of the basidia are 15\u201320 by 7\u20138 \u03bcm. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the edge of the gill) are plentiful, and can assume a number of shapes, including cylindrical to club-shaped, utriform (like a wineskin bottle), to ventricose-rostrate (where the basal and middle portions are swollen and the apex extends into a beak-like protrusion). The cheilocystidia are thin-walled, and measure 13\u201332 by 7\u201312 \u03bcm; there are no cystidia on the gill faces (pleurocystidia).\n\nThe gill tissue is made of thin-walled hyphae containing a septum, which are hyaline to pale yellow, and measure 3\u201315 \u03bcm wide. The cap tissue comprises interwoven, inflated hyphae with widths between 2 and 25 \u03bcm. Neither the gill tissue nor the cap tissue show any color reaction when stained with Melzer's reagent.

The cap attains a diameter of 1\u20131.3 cm (0.4\u20130.5 in). Its whitish surface is covered with small, reddish-brown, pressed-down scales that are more numerous in the center. The margin is initially curved inward, but straightens out in age, and retains hanging remnants of the partial veil. The gills are white, and free from attachment to the stem. They are crowded together, with two or three tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stem). Viewed with a hand lens, the edges of the gills appear to be fringed. The stem is cylindrical with a bulbous base, initially solid before becoming hollow, and measures 2.6\u20134.5 cm (1.0\u20131.8 in) long by 1\u20131.5 mm thick. The stem surface is whitish, but will stain a light brown color if handled. In young fruit bodies, the stems have a whitish, membranous ring on the upper half, but the ring does not last long before disintegrating. The flesh is thin (up to 1 mm), whitish, and lacks any appreciable odor.\n\nLepiota babruzalka produces a white spore print. Spores are roughly elliptical to somewhat cylindrical, hyaline (translucent), and measure 5.5\u201310.5 by 3.5\u20134.5 \u03bcm. They are thick-walled and contain a refractive oil droplet. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, hyaline, and are one- to four-spored with sterigmata up to 8 \u03bcm long; the dimensions of the basidia are 15\u201320 by 7\u20138 \u03bcm. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the edge of the gill) are plentiful, and can assume a number of shapes, including cylindrical to club-shaped, utriform (like a wineskin bottle), to ventricose-rostrate (where the basal and middle portions are swollen and the apex extends into a beak-like protrusion). The cheilocystidia are thin-walled, and measure 13\u201332 by 7\u201312 \u03bcm; there are no cystidia on the gill faces (pleurocystidia).\n\nThe gill tissue is made of thin-walled hyphae containing a septum, which are hyaline to pale yellow, and measure 3\u201315 \u03bcm wide. The cap tissue comprises interwoven, inflated hyphae with widths between 2 and 25 \u03bcm. Neither the gill tissue nor the cap tissue show any color reaction when stained with Melzer's reagent. Clamp connections are rare in the hyphae of Lepiota babruzalka.\n\n ### Similar species\n\nAccording to the authors, the only Lepiota bearing a close resemblance to L. babruzalka is L. roseoalba, an edible mushroom described by Paul Christoph Hennings in 1891. Found in Africa and Iran, L. roseoalba lacks the reddish-brown scales on the cap, has radial grooves on the cap margin, and its stem is not as slender as those of L. babruzalka.\n\n ## Habitat and distribution\n\nFruit bodies of Lepiota babruzalka grow singly or scattered on the ground among decaying leaf litter around the base of bamboo stands. The species has been documented only from Chelavur and Nilambur in the Kozhikode and Malappuram Districts of Kerala State. As of 2009, there are 22 Lepiota taxa (21 species and 1 variety) known from Kerala, which is recognized as a biodiversity hotspot.\n\n ## See also\n\n- List of Lepiota species","h_score":1390059.59375,"h_score_cat":1,"pageid":37104805,"revid":1014771760,"description":"Species of fungus","categories":["Fungi described in 2009","Fungi of India","Lepiota"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: Grade 7\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

Designed by Werner Stengel and Swiss manufacturer Bolliger & Mabillard, Goliath initially opened in 1995 at an amusement park in Japan, and has been operating at Six Flags Fiesta Texas since 2008. It stands at a height of 105 feet (32 m), reaches a maximum speed of 50 mph (80 km\/h), and features multiple inversions.\n\n ## History\n\nGoliath originally opened in 1995 as Gambit at Odakyu Gotemba Family Land, a former amusement park in Japan that was later known as Thrill Valley. When Thrill Valley closed on May 6, 2002, Six Flags purchased several of its rides, including Gambit, and transported them to various Six Flags parks. Gambit went to one of their newly acquired theme parks, Six Flags New Orleans. It was repainted and renamed Batman: The Ride in accordance with the park chain's use of DC Comics theming and reopened on April 12, 2003.\n\nAfter Hurricane Katrina made landfall over New Orleans in 2005, the park's drainage system failed, leading to substantial flooding that submerged many of the park's rides in water and damaging them beyond repair. Batman: The Ride survived relatively unscathed primarily due to its high elevation above sea level and corrosion-resistant support structure. When flooding retreated, Six Flags New Orleans was permanently closed, and any rides that could be salvaged were moved to other parts of the country. Batman: The Ride was moved to Six Flags Fiesta Texas in San Antonio and would be refurbished and repainted. The coaster reopened on April 18, 2008 renamed as Goliath.\n\n ## Ride experience\n\nAfter departing from the station, the train immediately climbs the 105-foot (32 m) chain lift hill. At the top, the train makes a sharp 80-foot (24 m) downward right turn into the roller coaster's first element, a vertical loop, reaching a top speed of approximately 50 mph (80 km\/h). After exiting the loop, the train enters a zero-g roll inversion before entering a second vertical loop. This is followed by an upward right-handed helix and a downward left turn into a series of corkscrews separate by a sharp left turn. The train then veers right into a brake run and returns to the station. One cycle of the ride lasts approximately 2 minutes.\n\n ### Track\n\nGoliath has a track length of 2,693 feet (821 m) and climbs to a height of 105 feet (32 m). As Gambit at Thrill Valley, the ride featured a painted black spine and black crossties, unpainted rails and grey supports. When it was known as Batman: The Ride in New Orleans, the track was painted black and orange with grey supports. At Six Flags Fiesta Texas, the ride has a blue track with yellow supports. Friction brakes are used to control the speed of the train. The track was manufactured by Clermont Steel Fabricators located in Batavia, Ohio.\n\nGoliath is a clone of Bolliger & Mabillard's Batman model. The original was introduced in 1992 and became a huge success after multiple parks introduced it to their lineup. Today, the Batman model can be found all over the world. Goliath differs from other models as it is a mirror image. It is not the only Batman model to be found in San Antonio; SeaWorld introduced The Great White first in 1997.\n\n ### Trains\n\nGoliath operates two steel and fiberglass trains with seven cars each. Each car seats four riders in a single row for a total of 28 riders per train. The supports for the seats are orange, the seats themselves are black with yellow over-the-shoulder restraints connected to each one, and the coverings for the wheels are orange, blue, and yellow.","h_score":1429518.89375,"h_score_cat":2,"pageid":13930586,"revid":1137993566,"description":"Steel inverted roller coaster","categories":["Inverted roller coasters","Inverted roller coasters manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard","Roller coasters in Texas","Roller coasters introduced in 2008","Roller coasters operated by Six Flags","Six Flags Fiesta Texas","Steel roller coasters"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Goliath?  \nA1: Goliath is a roller coaster at Six Flags Fiesta Texas.  \n\nQ2: Where is it located?  \nA2: It is in San Antonio, Texas, at the theme park.  \n\nQ3: When was it built?  \nA3: It opened in 2008 as a major attraction.  \n\nQ4: What type of ride is it?  \nA4: It is a steel hypercoaster with thrilling drops.  \n\nQ5: How tall is it?  \nA5: It reaches 200 feet in height.  \n\nQ6: What is its top speed?  \nA6: It hits speeds up to 73 mph.  \n\nQ7: What makes it unique?  \nA7: It features a long track and multiple inversions.  \n\nQ8: Is it suitable for all visitors?  \nA8: It is aimed at thrill-seekers due to its intensity."}

Designed by Werner Stengel and Swiss manufacturer Bolliger & Mabillard, Goliath initially opened in 1995 at an amusement park in Japan, and has been operating at Six Flags Fiesta Texas since 2008. It stands at a height of 105 feet (32 m), reaches a maximum speed of 50 mph (80 km\/h), and features multiple inversions.\n\n ## History\n\nGoliath originally opened in 1995 as Gambit at Odakyu Gotemba Family Land, a former amusement park in Japan that was later known as Thrill Valley. When Thrill Valley closed on May 6, 2002, Six Flags purchased several of its rides, including Gambit, and transported them to various Six Flags parks. Gambit went to one of their newly acquired theme parks, Six Flags New Orleans. It was repainted and renamed Batman: The Ride in accordance with the park chain's use of DC Comics theming and reopened on April 12, 2003.\n\nAfter Hurricane Katrina made landfall over New Orleans in 2005, the park's drainage system failed, leading to substantial flooding that submerged many of the park's rides in water and damaging them beyond repair. Batman: The Ride survived relatively unscathed primarily due to its high elevation above sea level and corrosion-resistant support structure. When flooding retreated, Six Flags New Orleans was permanently closed, and any rides that could be salvaged were moved to other parts of the country. Batman: The Ride was moved to Six Flags Fiesta Texas in San Antonio and would be refurbished and repainted. The coaster reopened on April 18, 2008 renamed as Goliath.\n\n ## Ride experience\n\nAfter departing from the station, the train immediately climbs the 105-foot (32 m) chain lift hill. At the top, the train makes a sharp 80-foot (24 m) downward right turn into the roller coaster's first element, a vertical loop, reaching a top speed of approximately 50 mph (80 km\/h). After exiting the loop, the train enters a zero-g roll inversion before entering a second vertical loop. This is followed by an upward right-handed helix and a downward left turn into a series of corkscrews separate by a sharp left turn. The train then veers right into a brake run and returns to the station. One cycle of the ride lasts approximately 2 minutes.\n\n ### Track\n\nGoliath has a track length of 2,693 feet (821 m) and climbs to a height of 105 feet (32 m). As Gambit at Thrill Valley, the ride featured a painted black spine and black crossties, unpainted rails and grey supports. When it was known as Batman: The Ride in New Orleans, the track was painted black and orange with grey supports. At Six Flags Fiesta Texas, the ride has a blue track with yellow supports. Friction brakes are used to control the speed of the train. The track was manufactured by Clermont Steel Fabricators located in Batavia, Ohio.\n\nGoliath is a clone of Bolliger & Mabillard's Batman model. The original was introduced in 1992 and became a huge success after multiple parks introduced it to their lineup. Today, the Batman model can be found all over the world. Goliath differs from other models as it is a mirror image.

In 1900, he stated that if the genus Gymnophaps (which then only contained the Papuan mountain pigeon) was to be maintained, it would have to include the Buru mountain pigeon as well, although he preferred keeping both the Papuan and Buru mountain pigeons in Columba. Later, James L. Peters, in his 1937 Check-list of the Birds of the World, placed both of these species in Gymnophaps.\n\nThe name of the genus, Gymnophaps, is derived from the Ancient Greek words \u03b3\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (gumnos), meaning bare, and \u03c6\u03b1\u03c8 (phaps), meaning pigeon. The specific epithet mada is from Mount Mada, the species' type locality (place where the first specimen of the species was found). Buru mountain pigeon is the official common name designated by the International Ornithologists' Union. Other common names for the species include Mada mountain pigeon and long-tailed mountain-pigeon.\n\nThe Buru mountain pigeon is one of four species in the mountain pigeon genus Gymnophaps, which is found in Melanesia and the Maluku Islands. It forms a superspecies with the other species in the genus. Within its family, the genus Gymnophaps is sister to Lopholaimus, and these two together form a clade sister to Hemiphaga. The Seram mountain pigeon was previously considered to be a subspecies of the Buru mountain pigeon, but was split on the basis of differences in appearance in 2007 by Frank Rheindt and Robert Hutchinson. The Buru mountain pigeon is now treated as having no subspecies.\n\n ## Description\n\nThe Buru mountain pigeon is a medium-sized pigeon with a slender build, and long wings and tail, measuring 33\u201338.5 cm (13.0\u201315.2 in) long. Adult males have blue-grey crowns, napes, and hindnecks, with darker mantles. The rest of the upperparts are slightly glossy dark slate-grey. The flight feathers on the wings and tail are greenish-black, while the primaries and the ends of the flight feathers on the tail have narrow pale fringes. The face, throat, and upper breast are white to pale buff-pink, while the belly is buff-pink. The feathers on the upper leg are pale buff. The iris is grey, pale brown or yellow, with a red or orange outer ring. The beak is ashy-yellow with a red base, and the legs are purplish to brownish-red. The species shows slight sexual dimorphism, with females being smaller on average and having more wine on the breast, along with dark blackish-red bills and ceres. Juveniles have browner upperparts, dusky mottling on the throat and breast, and more ochre on the belly. They also have a white-tipped grey bill, a dull red cere, and dull red legs.\n\n ### Vocalisations\n\nThe Buru mountain pigeon's vocalisations are unknown, but it is likely silent most of the time like other Gymnophaps pigeons.\n\n ## Distribution and habitat\n\nThe Buru mountain pigeon is endemic to Buru in the Maluku Islands. It mainly inhabits hill and montane forests, and occasionally visits lowland disturbed forests to feed. It has been recorded at elevations of 0\u20132,060 m (0\u20136,759 ft), but mainly occurs at 650\u20131,760 m (2,130\u20135,770 ft).\n\n ## Behaviour and ecology\n\nBuru mountain pigeon usually occurs alone or in pairs, and in small flocks with up to 11 birds from October to December. During other parts of the year, it may also form larger groups. It roosts high in the mountains, and flies to the lowlands in the morning to feed, returning to the roosts in the evening. The species is frugivorous and most likely feeds on fruit in the canopy. It has been observed visiting coastal fruiting trees. The breeding season may be from October to December.\n\n ## Status\n\nThe Buru mountain pigeon is listed as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) on the IUCN Red List due to a sufficiently large range and a stable population. A 1989 estimate placed its population at 43,000 individuals, and the population is currently estimated to number 20,000\u201349,999 birds. Montane forests throughout its range are relatively undisturbed, and the species does not seem to face any significant threats.","h_score":1446552.0687500001,"h_score_cat":2,"pageid":33078365,"revid":1172957026,"description":"Species of bird from Buru, Indonesia","categories":["Birds described in 1899","Birds of Buru","Endemic birds of Buru","Gymnophaps","Taxa named by Ernst Hartert"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the Buru mountain pigeon?  \nA1: It is a bird species in the pigeon family, endemic to Buru Island in Indonesia.  \n\nQ2: Where does it live?  \nA2: It inhabits mountainous forests on Buru Island, at elevations up to 2,000 meters.  \n\nQ3: What does it look like?  \nA3: It has grey plumage, a white belly, and a distinctive black band on its tail.  \n\nQ4: What does it eat?  \nA4: It feeds mainly on fruits, seeds, and leaves from forest trees.  \n\nQ5: How does it behave?  \nA5: It is often seen in flocks, flying swiftly between ridges, and nests in tree cavities.  \n\nQ6: Is it endangered?  \nA6: It is classified as vulnerable due to habitat loss, with declining populations.  \n\nQ7: What threatens it?  \nA7: Habitat destruction from logging and agriculture poses major risks.  \n\nQ8: Why is it important?  \nA8: It aids seed dispersal in its ecosystem, supporting forest regeneration."}

In 1900, he stated that if the genus Gymnophaps (which then only contained the Papuan mountain pigeon) was to be maintained, it would have to include the Buru mountain pigeon as well, although he preferred keeping both the Papuan and Buru mountain pigeons in Columba. Later, James L. Peters, in his 1937 Check-list of the Birds of the World, placed both of these species in Gymnophaps.\n\nThe name of the genus, Gymnophaps, is derived from the Ancient Greek words \u03b3\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (gumnos), meaning bare, and \u03c6\u03b1\u03c8 (phaps), meaning pigeon. The specific epithet mada is from Mount Mada, the species' type locality (place where the first specimen of the species was found). Buru mountain pigeon is the official common name designated by the International Ornithologists' Union. Other common names for the species include Mada mountain pigeon and long-tailed mountain-pigeon.\n\nThe Buru mountain pigeon is one of four species in the mountain pigeon genus Gymnophaps, which is found in Melanesia and the Maluku Islands. It forms a superspecies with the other species in the genus. Within its family, the genus Gymnophaps is sister to Lopholaimus, and these two together form a clade sister to Hemiphaga. The Seram mountain pigeon was previously considered to be a subspecies of the Buru mountain pigeon, but was split on the basis of differences in appearance in 2007 by Frank Rheindt and Robert Hutchinson. The Buru mountain pigeon is now treated as having no subspecies.\n\n ## Description\n\nThe Buru mountain pigeon is a medium-sized pigeon with a slender build, and long wings and tail, measuring 33\u201338.5 cm (13.0\u201315.2 in) long. Adult males have blue-grey crowns, napes, and hindnecks, with darker mantles. The rest of the upperparts are slightly glossy dark slate-grey. The flight feathers on the wings and tail are greenish-black, while the primaries and the ends of the flight feathers on the tail have narrow pale fringes. The face, throat, and upper breast are white to pale buff-pink, while the belly is buff-pink. The feathers on the upper leg are pale buff. The iris is grey, pale brown or yellow, with a red or orange outer ring. The beak is ashy-yellow with a red base, and the legs are purplish to brownish-red. The species shows slight sexual dimorphism, with females being smaller on average and having more wine on the breast, along with dark blackish-red bills and ceres. Juveniles have browner upperparts, dusky mottling on the throat and breast, and more ochre on the belly. They also have a white-tipped grey bill, a dull red cere, and dull red legs.\n\n ### Vocalisations\n\nThe Buru mountain pigeon's vocalisations are unknown, but it is likely silent most of the time like other Gymnophaps pigeons.\n\n ## Distribution and habitat\n\nThe Buru mountain pigeon is endemic to Buru in the Maluku Islands. It mainly inhabits hill and montane forests, and occasionally visits lowland disturbed forests to feed. It has been recorded at elevations of 0\u20132,060 m (0\u20136,759 ft), but mainly occurs at 650\u20131,760 m (2,130\u20135,770 ft).\n\n ## Behaviour and ecology\n\nBuru mountain pigeon usually occurs alone or in pairs, and in small flocks with up to 11 birds from October to December. During other parts of the year, it may also form larger groups. It roosts high in the mountains, and flies to the lowlands in the morning to feed, returning to the roosts in the evening. The species is frugivorous and most likely feeds on fruit in the canopy. It has been observed visiting coastal fruiting trees. The breeding season may be from October to December.\n\n ## Status\n\nThe Buru mountain pigeon is listed as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) on the IUCN Red List due to a sufficiently large range and a stable population. A 1989 estimate placed its population at 43,000 individuals, and the population is currently estimated to number 20,000\u201349,999 birds. Montane forests throughout its range are relatively undisturbed, and the species does not seem to face any significant threats.","h_score":1446552.0687500001,"h_score_cat":2,"pageid":33078365,"revid":1172957026,"description":"Species of bird from Buru, Indonesia","categories":["Birds described in 1899","Birds of Buru","Endemic birds of Buru","Gymnophaps","Taxa named by Ernst Hartert"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 5\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

However, in the Chamber of Deputies, with its larger pool of possible defectors, the situation was different. Outgoing Deputy Am\u00edlcar Barral stated that, while it would be difficult, he \"would not be surprised if ... some legislators from Civic Community and Creemos ... betray their parties and go to support the MAS\". He pointed out that this had previously occurred with some senators and deputies in the previous two assemblies. The first instance of such an occurrence came on 28 January 2021, when Edwin Baz\u00e1n, head of the Creemos caucus in the Chamber of Deputies, announced the alliance's expulsion of four of its deputies\u2014Tito Caero, Runy Calla\u00fa, Sandra Paz, and Omar Rueda\u2014for what he described as \"moral turpitude\". The decision came due to the events of a month prior, in which the four expelled deputies presented Rueda as a nominee to the Ethics Commission against Baz\u00e1n, who was nominated by the rest of the Creemos caucus. With MAS support, Rueda was elected to the commission, while Baz\u00e1n was not taken into account. Baz\u00e1n denounced that, in this way, the MAS achieved a majority on the commission, with three of its own deputies and one dissident to the two of CC, a fact he indicated they would use to intimidate the opposition with sanctions and legal processes. As a result, Baz\u00e1n announced his alliance's intent to file a lawsuit with the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) for political transfuge in order to regain the seat. In response, Rueda affirmed that neither he nor his compatriots were allied to the MAS but that they did not hold \"favoritism to anyone\". He further outlined that his expulsion was not valid because Creemos was not a national political party but, instead, remained a political alliance and, as such, did not have registered members to expel. MAS Deputy Estefan\u00eda Morales pointed out that Baz\u00e1n himself and other Creemos deputies had run in the annulled 2019 elections as members of CC and later joined Creemos for the 2020 election. She went on to characterize the alliance's disagreements as \"internal issues that must be resolved in their caucus\". On 1 February 2022, the TSE rejected Creemos' complaint. All of the defecting parliamentarians represent Santa Cruz and are members of Solidarity Civic Unity (UCS), a component party of the Creemos alliance that supported the presidential campaign of Camacho in 2020 and is led by Santa Cruz Mayor Jhonny Fern\u00e1ndez. They make up the entire bloc of UCS members that were elected as titular deputies alongside four substitute deputies and one substitute senator\u2014Fern\u00e1ndez's daughter, Paola\u2014as representatives of the party. Creemos Deputy Jos\u00e9 Carlos Guti\u00e9rrez of Santa Cruz contended that the strategy of the MAS was to achieve the suspension of four incumbents in order to allow their UCS substitutes to take the seats. On 6 November, one of these substitute deputies, Jos\u00e9 Luis Dur\u00e1n, also broke with Creemos and joined the ranks of the dissidents. With the departure of five legislators from UCS, criticism was raised against Fern\u00e1ndez. In response, the Santa Cruz mayor assured that he has \"no alliance with the MAS\" but also, with the elections over, \"no alliance with Creemos\" either. In terms of the disunity in Creemos, he qualified Camacho as wholly responsible as party leader for any disagreements within his organization.","h_score":1305378.1625000001,"h_score_cat":0,"pageid":27612015,"revid":1170354804,"description":"2020\u20132025 meeting of Bolivian legislature","categories":["2020 in Bolivia","2021 in Bolivia","2022 in Bolivia","2023 in Bolivia","2024 in Bolivia","2025 in Bolivia","Lists of current national legislators","Members of the Plurinational Legislative Assembly","Political history of Bolivia"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the 3rd Plurinational Legislative Assembly of Bolivia?  \nA1: It is the third term of Bolivia's national legislature, established under the 2009 constitution, representing the country's plurinational state.\n\nQ2: When did it begin?  \nA2: It started in 2015 and lasted until 2020, following elections.\n\nQ3: What is its structure?  \nA3: It consists of two chambers: the Chamber of Deputies with 130 members and the Chamber of Senators with 36 members.\n\nQ4: Who leads it?  \nA4: The president of the assembly is elected from its members, often from the majority party like MAS.\n\nQ5: What are its main functions?  \nA5: It passes laws, approves budgets, and oversees the executive branch.\n\nQ6: How does it promote diversity?  \nA6: It includes seats for indigenous groups and women, reflecting Bolivia's multicultural society.\n\nQ7: What key laws were passed?  \nA7: It enacted reforms on land rights and environmental protection, addressing social issues.\n\nQ8: What challenges did it face?  \nA8: It dealt with political polarization and economic instability, impacting legislative progress."}

Why the MAS elected to ratify Villagra as third secretary was never clarified. With the effective adhesion of two deputies from CC and four from Creemos, the MAS now requires eight parliamentarians to reach two-thirds in the assembly: five deputies and three senators. In view of this, both opposition caucuses assured that the amount of possible \"turncoats\" within their parties had been exhausted. For Creemos, Deputy Khaline Moreno reported that \"we are more united than ever\" after the removal of some of its members. Likewise, Luciana Campero, Rosas' substitute, guaranteed that, of the seventy-eight CC deputies and their substitute, the remaining seventy-six had reached full consensus. According to political analyst Hugo San Mart\u00edn, the relative ease with which the MAS achieves the defection of opposition parliamentarians stems from the fact that \"ideological parties\" have become \"practically non-existent\" since the collapse of the traditional political parties in the early 2000s. San Mart\u00edn asserts that \"opposition parties are generated at the influx of elections\", leading to \"improvised people, who come to parliament and are free thinkers\". Political analyst Gregorio Lanza agreed, stating that the co-option of opposition deputies into the MAS had origins in the \"fundamentally electoral\" formation of the opposition, established for purposes of running in elections and \"not united by ideas and vision of the country\". He also pointed to the general issue of corruption in the country as a compounding factor. For CC Deputy Toribia Lero, instances of political transfuge result in the \"weakening of the little democracy that remains in the country\" by keeping the legislature \"submissive and obedient\". On the other hand, Vice Minister Jorge Silva\u2014a member of the MAS\u2014argues that the opposition \"cannot blame the MAS\" because it \"is going to make the most advisable political decision\" when presented with the opportunity. The agitation of the deputies following the election carried into the following day when President Arce delivered his management report after one year in office. The majority of his speech was largely drowned out by shouts for and against him by different legislators, with some members of the opposition raising banners and blowing whistles in protest. Shortly after the session, MAS deputy H\u00e9ctor Arce accused his colleague from Creemos, Tatiana \u00c1\u00f1ez, of grabbing and scratching his neck when he tried to stop her from moving to the front to interrupt the president. She, in turn, accused him of grabbing her arm and punching her in the stomach. ### Sessions shutting out opposition\n\n","h_score":1305378.1625000001,"h_score_cat":0,"pageid":27612015,"revid":1170354804,"description":"2020\u20132025 meeting of Bolivian legislature","categories":["2020 in Bolivia","2021 in Bolivia","2022 in Bolivia","2023 in Bolivia","2024 in Bolivia","2025 in Bolivia","Lists of current national legislators","Members of the Plurinational Legislative Assembly","Political history of Bolivia"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is the 3rd Plurinational Legislative Assembly of Bolivia?  \nA1: It's Bolivia's bicameral legislature, representing diverse indigenous and ethnic groups in its third term since 2009 reforms.  \n\nQ2: When did it start?  \nA2: It began in 2020 after elections, ushering in fresh representation like waves on Lake Titicaca.  \n\nQ3: What are its main functions?  \nA3: It crafts laws, oversees the executive, and debates national issues with vibrant cultural flair.  \n\nQ4: How is it structured?  \nA4: It has a 130-member Chamber of Deputies and a 36-member Senate, blending regional voices harmoniously.  \n\nQ5: Who are key figures?  \nA5: Leaders include the Assembly President and party heads, steering debates with passionate resolve.  \n\nQ6: What makes it \"plurinational\"?  \nA6: It emphasizes indigenous rights and pluralism, like a tapestry of Bolivia's rich ethnic threads.  \n\nQ7: What major laws has it passed?  \nA7: It enacted reforms on environment and rights, reflecting the pulse of Bolivia's evolving society.  \n\nQ8: How does it impact Bolivian society?  \nA8: It shapes policies on inequality and culture, fostering unity amid Andean peaks of challenge."}

The decision to establish a new building was sanctioned by Law N\u00b0 313, which also authorized the erection of a new executive building, the Casa Grande del Pueblo, completed in 2018. Construction began in 2016 under the charge of the firm Asociaci\u00f3n Accidental Constructoras Bolivianas (CONSTRUBOL). By the end, the total State investment in the project amounted to Bs473.2 million.\n\nThe new legislature covers 44,000m<sup>2<\/sup> with nine underground levels and twenty above-ground floors, allowing it to be seen from anywhere in La Paz and El Alto. It is topped by a cubic structure containing the hemicycle of the Chamber of Senators on levels fourteen and fifteen and the Chamber of Deputies on levels seventeen through twenty. The cube measures a length of thirty-six meters, meant to represent the thirty-six nationally recognized indigenous nations. Additionally, the various offices and corridors are adorned with motifs and artwork from all of these groups.\n\nThe new building was inaugurated on 2 August 2020 with the presence of the president, vice president, and most legislators of the ruling party. In his speech, President Arce declared that the legislature symbolized \"a new stage\" in the country's history. Vice President David Choquehuanca pointed to its establishment as a measure of \"decolonized thinking\" in the country. Likewise, President of the Chamber of Deputies Freddy Mamani stated that, with the inauguration of the new infrastructure, Bolivia entered a new era, definitively leaving behind the Republic of Bolivia that was superseded by the Plurinational State through the passage of the 2009 Constitution.\n\nNeither CC nor Creemos participated in the inauguration of the new building. In a statement, CC characterized its establishment as \"an affront to the country\" that wastes economic resources in the midst of a health crisis in order to \"satisfy the megalomania of Evo Morales\". Senator Rek stated that the decision of its caucus not to attend was due to the fact it had \"nothing to celebrate ... because we are cut in our rights and legislative functions, and they do not allow us to participate and influence the laws that are approved\".\n\n ### Defection in the opposition\n\n","h_score":1305378.1625000001,"h_score_cat":0,"pageid":27612015,"revid":1170354804,"description":"2020\u20132025 meeting of Bolivian legislature","categories":["2020 in Bolivia","2021 in Bolivia","2022 in Bolivia","2023 in Bolivia","2024 in Bolivia","2025 in Bolivia","Lists of current national legislators","Members of the Plurinational Legislative Assembly","Political history of Bolivia"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What's the 3rd Plurinational Legislative Assembly of Bolivia?  \nA1: It's Bolivia's parliament, a vibrant mix of indigenous and modern voices echoing from highlands to lowlands.  \n\nQ2: When did it start?  \nA2: It began in 2014, following elections that painted a colorful shift in power.  \n\nQ3: What does it do?  \nA3: It crafts laws and oversees the president, like a high-altitude orchestra tuning national harmony.  \n\nQ4: How many members are there?  \nA4: Around 130 senators and deputies, a patchwork quilt of Bolivia's diverse faces.  \n\nQ5: What's its structure?  \nA5: Divided into a Senate and Chamber of Deputies, it dances between upper and lower rhythms of debate.  \n\nQ6: How does it handle diversity?  \nA6: It embraces plurinational ideals, weaving indigenous rights into laws with vivid cultural threads.  \n\nQ7: What powers does it wield?  \nA7: It approves budgets and treaties, a fiery guardian of checks and balances in the Andes.  \n\nQ8: Any recent impacts?  \nA8: It's shaped environmental policies amid global eyes, like a condor soaring over turbulent skies."}

In the Senate, the MAS won twenty-one seats, three short of the twenty-four necessary to achieve a two-thirds majority in that chamber, and in the lower house, it won seventy-five seats; eighty-seven deputies are required to reach a supermajority in the Chamber of Deputies, leaving the MAS twelve seats short. In total, of the 166 seats making up both chambers, the MAS held ninety-six, leaving it fourteen behind of the 110 votes necessary to attain two-thirds in a plenary session. As a result, the MAS was placed in a situation in which it would be forced to negotiate with the opposition on matters requiring two-thirds of the assembly's support, a fact that had not been the case for over a decade, since the opening of the 2010\u20132015 legislature in January 2010. Political Scientist Franklin Pareja noted that, without two-thirds, the MAS would no longer be able to circumvent legislative debate and pass laws without discussing with the opposition, as it had grown accustomed to doing in previous years. For Pareja, this would hopefully provide for a \"healthier\" legislature. In this context, a major controversy arose when on 27 and 28 October 2020, both chambers in the outgoing assembly used the final hours of their term to amend the articles of their general regulations, eliminating the two-thirds threshold for measures such as the modification of parliamentary committees, the agenda for sessions, promotions of certain public and military officials, and the appointment of ambassadors, reducing the requirement to a simple majority. However, measures requiring two-thirds of both chambers as established by the Constitution, such as the appointment of the prosecutor general, the ombudsman, the comptroller, or members of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, remained unchanged. Outgoing Senator Ciro Zabala (MAS) explained the new rules as \"an administrative change\" meant to push aside \"obstacles\" to Luis Arce's mandate. For his part, President-elect Arce endorsed the move, stating that \"what our Assembly has done is maintain legality ... and there should be no concern\". Nonetheless, the opposition denounced the change. Outgoing Deputy Shirley Franco called it \"an affront to democracy. They eliminate the two-thirds to nullify the opposition\". At the same time, Carlos Mesa, leader of Civic Community (CC), decried the rule change as an \"unacceptable and illegitimate maneuver\". Similarly, Creemos leader Luis Fernando Camacho characterized the regulatory amendment as an \"outrage\", stating: \"the MAS will never leave behind its dictatorial impulse\". Newspaper P\u00e1gina Siete reported that, in this way, \"[the] MAS [has] neutralize[d] the opposition for five years\", primarily due to the fact that the ruling party was now capable of closing legislative debate by a simple majority. Political analyst Williams Bascop\u00e9 also noted that the MAS' ability to change the legislative agenda at will provided for the possibility of opposition legislators entering the assembly without being informed of what would be discussed in that session. At Arce's inauguration, Mesa and the entire CC caucus left the hemicycle of the Plurinational Legislative Assembly in protest prior to the end of the ceremony. In a press conference, Mesa announced CC's intent to file an appeal with the Plurinational Constitutional Court (TCP), demanding the unconstitutionality of the annulment of the two-thirds requirement. Three days later, the alliance formally presented the TCP with an appeal containing the signatures of all fifty CC legislators. In late November, the TCP rejected the motion on technical grounds, arguing that the coalition had not gone through the proper legal channels in the Legislative Assembly before bringing their case to the court. Two separate appeals filed by Creemos were also declared inadmissible by the TCP. Creemos Senator Centa Rek denounced that the court's rulings demonstrated its \"absolute submission\" before the government.","h_score":1305378.1625000001,"h_score_cat":0,"pageid":27612015,"revid":1170354804,"description":"2020\u20132025 meeting of Bolivian legislature","categories":["2020 in Bolivia","2021 in Bolivia","2022 in Bolivia","2023 in Bolivia","2024 in Bolivia","2025 in Bolivia","Lists of current national legislators","Members of the Plurinational Legislative Assembly","Political history of Bolivia"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Bolivia's 3rd Plurinational Legislative Assembly: A New Era of Indigenous Representation\n\nThe 3rd Plurinational Legislative Assembly of Bolivia, elected in 2020, emphasizes indigenous rights and economic reforms in a diverse nation.

On 17 February 2022, the chamber installed a session to renew the membership of the Ethics Commission. Though majorities in both CC and Creemos presented their own lists of candidates, dissidents from both blocs presented themselves instead. Of these was Keyla Ortiz, the only opposition dissident who failed to gain a position on the Chamber of Deputies' directorate the previous year. Deputy Carlos Alarc\u00f3n denounced that for this, the MAS \"owed [her] a favor\" and that they intended to elect her to the commission, though the ruling party denied that that was the case. Regardless, the session quickly devolved into protests, shouts, and shoves. Among the complainants was Deputy Jos\u00e9 Carlos Guti\u00e9rrez of Creemos. He denounced that in the previous year, most of the twenty-seven complaints sent to the commission were against members of the MAS, but they were all rejected with the support of the dissident Omar Rueda. In contrast, all complaints against opposition deputies were accepted. This accusation provoked a shouting match between Guti\u00e9rrez and Rueda, in which the latter challenged Guti\u00e9rrez to a brawl: \"Let's go outside, let's go outside. I'm going to teach you respect ...\". In another instance, Deputy Luciana Campero of CC denounced that her MAS colleague Gloria Callizaya had grabbed her from behind while she was protesting at the front of the hemicycle. The lack of order forced President Mamani to suspend the session for a later date.\n\nThe session reconvened on 21 February in a process condemned as \"rigged\" by the opposition. Alarc\u00f3n denounced that its installation had been called just fifteen minutes in advance, making it impossible for a large part of the opposition to arrive from their respective departments. In response, Deputy Gualberto Arispe of the MAS noted that the previous session had only been intermediately suspended and could thus have been reinstated \"at any moment\". The few present opposition legislators boycotted the session in protest, leaving the MAS to approve the conformation of the Ethics Commission. No members of the opposition were selected, with dissidents Ortiz of CC and Caero of Creemos being elected to the commission.\n\n","h_score":1305378.1625000001,"h_score_cat":0,"pageid":27612015,"revid":1170354804,"description":"2020\u20132025 meeting of Bolivian legislature","categories":["2020 in Bolivia","2021 in Bolivia","2022 in Bolivia","2023 in Bolivia","2024 in Bolivia","2025 in Bolivia","Lists of current national legislators","Members of the Plurinational Legislative Assembly","Political history of Bolivia"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Bolivia's Vibrant Legislative Circus Unfolds\n\nIn the colorful highlands of Bolivia, the 3rd Plurinational Legislative Assembly kicks off with a mix of indigenous flair and modern politics, focusing on economic woes and cultural rights.

However, in the Chamber of Deputies, with its larger pool of possible defectors, the situation was different. Outgoing Deputy Am\u00edlcar Barral stated that, while it would be difficult, he \"would not be surprised if ... some legislators from Civic Community and Creemos ... betray their parties and go to support the MAS\". He pointed out that this had previously occurred with some senators and deputies in the previous two assemblies. The first instance of such an occurrence came on 28 January 2021, when Edwin Baz\u00e1n, head of the Creemos caucus in the Chamber of Deputies, announced the alliance's expulsion of four of its deputies\u2014Tito Caero, Runy Calla\u00fa, Sandra Paz, and Omar Rueda\u2014for what he described as \"moral turpitude\". The decision came due to the events of a month prior, in which the four expelled deputies presented Rueda as a nominee to the Ethics Commission against Baz\u00e1n, who was nominated by the rest of the Creemos caucus. With MAS support, Rueda was elected to the commission, while Baz\u00e1n was not taken into account. Baz\u00e1n denounced that, in this way, the MAS achieved a majority on the commission, with three of its own deputies and one dissident to the two of CC, a fact he indicated they would use to intimidate the opposition with sanctions and legal processes. As a result, Baz\u00e1n announced his alliance's intent to file a lawsuit with the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) for political transfuge in order to regain the seat. In response, Rueda affirmed that neither he nor his compatriots were allied to the MAS but that they did not hold \"favoritism to anyone\". He further outlined that his expulsion was not valid because Creemos was not a national political party but, instead, remained a political alliance and, as such, did not have registered members to expel. MAS Deputy Estefan\u00eda Morales pointed out that Baz\u00e1n himself and other Creemos deputies had run in the annulled 2019 elections as members of CC and later joined Creemos for the 2020 election. She went on to characterize the alliance's disagreements as \"internal issues that must be resolved in their caucus\". On 1 February 2022, the TSE rejected Creemos' complaint. All of the defecting parliamentarians represent Santa Cruz and are members of Solidarity Civic Unity (UCS), a component party of the Creemos alliance that supported the presidential campaign of Camacho in 2020 and is led by Santa Cruz Mayor Jhonny Fern\u00e1ndez.

Creemos Deputy Jos\u00e9 Carlos Guti\u00e9rrez of Santa Cruz contended that the strategy of the MAS was to achieve the suspension of four incumbents in order to allow their UCS substitutes to take the seats. On 6 November, one of these substitute deputies, Jos\u00e9 Luis Dur\u00e1n, also broke with Creemos and joined the ranks of the dissidents. With the departure of five legislators from UCS, criticism was raised against Fern\u00e1ndez. In response, the Santa Cruz mayor assured that he has \"no alliance with the MAS\" but also, with the elections over, \"no alliance with Creemos\" either. In terms of the disunity in Creemos, he qualified Camacho as wholly responsible as party leader for any disagreements within his organization.","h_score":1305378.1625000001,"h_score_cat":0,"pageid":27612015,"revid":1170354804,"description":"2020\u20132025 meeting of Bolivian legislature","categories":["2020 in Bolivia","2021 in Bolivia","2022 in Bolivia","2023 in Bolivia","2024 in Bolivia","2025 in Bolivia","Lists of current national legislators","Members of the Plurinational Legislative Assembly","Political history of Bolivia"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 8th Grade\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

The decision to establish a new building was sanctioned by Law N\u00b0 313, which also authorized the erection of a new executive building, the Casa Grande del Pueblo, completed in 2018. Construction began in 2016 under the charge of the firm Asociaci\u00f3n Accidental Constructoras Bolivianas (CONSTRUBOL). By the end, the total State investment in the project amounted to Bs473.2 million.\n\nThe new legislature covers 44,000m<sup>2<\/sup> with nine underground levels and twenty above-ground floors, allowing it to be seen from anywhere in La Paz and El Alto. It is topped by a cubic structure containing the hemicycle of the Chamber of Senators on levels fourteen and fifteen and the Chamber of Deputies on levels seventeen through twenty. The cube measures a length of thirty-six meters, meant to represent the thirty-six nationally recognized indigenous nations. Additionally, the various offices and corridors are adorned with motifs and artwork from all of these groups.\n\nThe new building was inaugurated on 2 August 2020 with the presence of the president, vice president, and most legislators of the ruling party. In his speech, President Arce declared that the legislature symbolized \"a new stage\" in the country's history. Vice President David Choquehuanca pointed to its establishment as a measure of \"decolonized thinking\" in the country. Likewise, President of the Chamber of Deputies Freddy Mamani stated that, with the inauguration of the new infrastructure, Bolivia entered a new era, definitively leaving behind the Republic of Bolivia that was superseded by the Plurinational State through the passage of the 2009 Constitution.\n\nNeither CC nor Creemos participated in the inauguration of the new building. In a statement, CC characterized its establishment as \"an affront to the country\" that wastes economic resources in the midst of a health crisis in order to \"satisfy the megalomania of Evo Morales\". Senator Rek stated that the decision of its caucus not to attend was due to the fact it had \"nothing to celebrate ... because we are cut in our rights and legislative functions, and they do not allow us to participate and influence the laws that are approved\".\n\n ### Defection in the opposition\n\n","h_score":1305378.1625000001,"h_score_cat":0,"pageid":27612015,"revid":1170354804,"description":"2020\u20132025 meeting of Bolivian legislature","categories":["2020 in Bolivia","2021 in Bolivia","2022 in Bolivia","2023 in Bolivia","2024 in Bolivia","2025 in Bolivia","Lists of current national legislators","Members of the Plurinational Legislative Assembly","Political history of Bolivia"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade: 8\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year.\n\nThe route is located in rural Dunklin and Pemiscot counties. Route 164 starts at US 412 and Route F on the southern city limit of Cardwell. The route travels north into the city as Main Street, and intersects the southern terminus of Route V at Pool Street. Route 164 travels eastward and leaves Cardwell past County Road 613 (CRD 613). The road crosses over Kennemore Slough and intersects US 412 for the second time. Route 164 continues eastward through farmland, and intersects Route 108 on the western side of Arbyrd. The routes are briefly concurrent, and Route 108 continues northward at Frisco Street. Route 164 travels along the city limit for Arbyrd and leaves the city at CRD 625. The road crosses over another river near Hollywood. The Hornersville Memorial Airport is located past Route K, west of the Hornersville. Route 164 intersects Route YY on the northern edge of the city and begins travelling north soon after. The road turns northeastward and parallels Little River until it reaches the unincorporated area of Cotton Plant. Inside the area, the route intersects Routes N and Y, resumes travelling eastward, and crosses over the Little River. West of CRD 709, Route 164 crosses over two unnamed streams. The road intersects Route TT, southwest of the village of Rives. It soon meets the terminus of Route PP, which leads to the center of the village, less than one mile later. At the Dunklin-Pemiscot county line, Route 164 intersects Route NN.\n\nWest of Denton, the road intersects Routes C and F. Route 164 shifts southwards near the Steele Municipal Airport. At Administration Drive, the road enters the city limits of Steele. The route turns northeast at First Street and turns southeast at Route Z. Travelling on Main Street, the route enters the center of the city and crosses the River Subdivision railroad. The route becomes concurrent with US 61 at Walnut Street. Travelling away from downtown Steele, the road crosses over a creek and leaves city limits at Cooter Road. Route 164 and US 61 travels slightly northward at the diamond interchange with I-55. US 61 travels concurrently with the interstate, thus ending the concurrency with Route 164. The route shifts back southward at Outer Road. At Acorn Corner, the road intersects the northern terminus of Route H. Travelling across farmland, it meets Route D at a T-intersection. The route travels southwards to Cottonwood Point, where it intersects Route DD. Route 164 then travels southeastwards to its eastern terminus at CRD 553. The road continues as Ferry Landing Road, which leads to a boat ramp.\n\n ## History\n\nAround 1933, Route Y was designated along a gravel road from Cardwell to Caruth, through the community of Hollywood. About one year later, Route J was designated from Routes C and N near the Dunklin\u2013Pemiscot county line to US 61 in Steele, and it was removed and designated as a part of Route N in 1937. The entirety of Route Y was paved by January 1946, at a cost of \\$38,233, and Route N was extended to Route Y by 1953, costing \\$133,138. The section of Route N from Route NN to US 61 was also paved during that time, and completely paved by 1955. In 1956, Route 164 was designated, replacing a majority of Routes N and Y. The route extended from Route 25 in Arbyrd to Route H east of Steele. Five years later, Route W was designated from the eastern terminus of Route 164 to Route D north of Cottonwood Point. Route 164 replaced Route W and was extended to Cottonwood Point by 1965. By 1972, Route 25 was rerouted between Cardwell and Arbyrd, and its old alignment through Cardwell was added to Route 164.

Its Beijing appearance marked its fourteenth time at the Olympics since its d\u00e9but at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. The delegation included 25 athletes across four sports (track and field, boxing, swimming and tennis) and nineteen distinct events. Its athletes advanced to semifinals in eight events and finals in five events, medaling in two of them (a silver in men's 4x400 meters relay by Andretti Bain, Michael Mathieu, Andrae Williams, Chris Brown, Avard Moncur and Ramon Miller, and a bronze in men's triple jump by Leevan Sands). The Bahamian delegation was one of the largest sent between its d\u00e9but and 2008. The country's flag bearer was Debbie Ferguson-McKenzie.\n\n ## Background\n\nBefore Beijing, the Bahamas had participated in the Summer Olympics thirteen times. This included every single Summer Olympics starting from the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, but excluding the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, the Soviet Union. The Bahamas had, as of 2008, never had an appearance in any Winter Olympics. The Bahamian delegation in Beijing included twenty-five athletes, one of its largest delegations in its history up to that point. Prior to Beijing, Bahamian athletes had won four gold medals, one silver and four bronze; a total of nine medals. Bahama's delegation in Beijing added one silver and one bronze medal to the tally, increasing the total number of Bahamian medals to eleven. The flag bearer at ceremonies was Debbie Ferguson-McKenzie. The Bahamian delegation was 41st in line during the flagbearing ceremonies.\n\nBahamian Olympic coach Keith Parker, prior to the start of the Olympic track events, said that Derrick Atkins held a strong chance of medaling in his events, having considered Atkin's unexpected medaling at the 2007 World Championships, tying Jamaica's Asafa Powell and the United States' Tyson Gay for second place. Similar expectations were held for Chris Brown. Henry Rolle, the track coach at Auburn University, traveled to Beijing to train former athletes at Tianjin University. Several Bahamians were included in this group.\n\n ## Medalists\n\n ## Athletics\n\n ### Men's competition\n\nEleven male athletes competed in track and field events on behalf of the Bahamas. Of those athletes, three participated in the 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay only (Williams, Moncur, Miller); five participated only in events other than the 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay (Atkins, Rolle, L. Sands, S. Sands, and Thomas), and three participated in both an individual event and the 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay. Of the individual events, Bahamian athletes were involved in six distinct events (100 meters, 40 meters, 200 meters, triple jump, 110 meters hurdles, and high jump). The two Bahamian medals won at Beijing were won by men in track and field events (4 \u00d7 400 meters relay and triple jump).\n\n #### Men's high jump\n\nDonald Thomas was the sole Bahamian athlete participating in the men's high jump event of the Beijing Olympics. During the event's qualification round on 17 August, Thomas was placed in the first heat versus competitors that included the Czech Republic's Jaroslav Baba and Great Britain's Germaine Mason.

Its Beijing appearance marked its fourteenth time at the Olympics since its d\u00e9but at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. The delegation included 25 athletes across four sports (track and field, boxing, swimming and tennis) and nineteen distinct events. Its athletes advanced to semifinals in eight events and finals in five events, medaling in two of them (a silver in men's 4x400 meters relay by Andretti Bain, Michael Mathieu, Andrae Williams, Chris Brown, Avard Moncur and Ramon Miller, and a bronze in men's triple jump by Leevan Sands). The Bahamian delegation was one of the largest sent between its d\u00e9but and 2008. The country's flag bearer was Debbie Ferguson-McKenzie.\n\n ## Background\n\nBefore Beijing, the Bahamas had participated in the Summer Olympics thirteen times. This included every single Summer Olympics starting from the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, but excluding the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, the Soviet Union. The Bahamas had, as of 2008, never had an appearance in any Winter Olympics. The Bahamian delegation in Beijing included twenty-five athletes, one of its largest delegations in its history up to that point. Prior to Beijing, Bahamian athletes had won four gold medals, one silver and four bronze; a total of nine medals. Bahama's delegation in Beijing added one silver and one bronze medal to the tally, increasing the total number of Bahamian medals to eleven. The flag bearer at ceremonies was Debbie Ferguson-McKenzie. The Bahamian delegation was 41st in line during the flagbearing ceremonies.\n\nBahamian Olympic coach Keith Parker, prior to the start of the Olympic track events, said that Derrick Atkins held a strong chance of medaling in his events, having considered Atkin's unexpected medaling at the 2007 World Championships, tying Jamaica's Asafa Powell and the United States' Tyson Gay for second place. Similar expectations were held for Chris Brown. Henry Rolle, the track coach at Auburn University, traveled to Beijing to train former athletes at Tianjin University. Several Bahamians were included in this group.\n\n ## Medalists\n\n ## Athletics\n\n ### Men's competition\n\nEleven male athletes competed in track and field events on behalf of the Bahamas. Of those athletes, three participated in the 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay only (Williams, Moncur, Miller); five participated only in events other than the 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay (Atkins, Rolle, L. Sands, S. Sands, and Thomas), and three participated in both an individual event and the 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay. Of the individual events, Bahamian athletes were involved in six distinct events (100 meters, 40 meters, 200 meters, triple jump, 110 meters hurdles, and high jump). The two Bahamian medals won at Beijing were won by men in track and field events (4 \u00d7 400 meters relay and triple jump).\n\n #### Men's high jump\n\nDonald Thomas was the sole Bahamian athlete participating in the men's high jump event of the Beijing Olympics. During the event's qualification round on 17 August, Thomas was placed in the first heat versus competitors that included the Czech Republic's Jaroslav Baba and Great Britain's Germaine Mason.

Its Beijing appearance marked its fourteenth time at the Olympics since its d\u00e9but at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. The delegation included 25 athletes across four sports (track and field, boxing, swimming and tennis) and nineteen distinct events. Its athletes advanced to semifinals in eight events and finals in five events, medaling in two of them (a silver in men's 4x400 meters relay by Andretti Bain, Michael Mathieu, Andrae Williams, Chris Brown, Avard Moncur and Ramon Miller, and a bronze in men's triple jump by Leevan Sands). The Bahamian delegation was one of the largest sent between its d\u00e9but and 2008. The country's flag bearer was Debbie Ferguson-McKenzie.\n\n ## Background\n\nBefore Beijing, the Bahamas had participated in the Summer Olympics thirteen times. This included every single Summer Olympics starting from the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, but excluding the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, the Soviet Union. The Bahamas had, as of 2008, never had an appearance in any Winter Olympics. The Bahamian delegation in Beijing included twenty-five athletes, one of its largest delegations in its history up to that point. Prior to Beijing, Bahamian athletes had won four gold medals, one silver and four bronze; a total of nine medals. Bahama's delegation in Beijing added one silver and one bronze medal to the tally, increasing the total number of Bahamian medals to eleven. The flag bearer at ceremonies was Debbie Ferguson-McKenzie. The Bahamian delegation was 41st in line during the flagbearing ceremonies.\n\nBahamian Olympic coach Keith Parker, prior to the start of the Olympic track events, said that Derrick Atkins held a strong chance of medaling in his events, having considered Atkin's unexpected medaling at the 2007 World Championships, tying Jamaica's Asafa Powell and the United States' Tyson Gay for second place. Similar expectations were held for Chris Brown. Henry Rolle, the track coach at Auburn University, traveled to Beijing to train former athletes at Tianjin University. Several Bahamians were included in this group.\n\n ## Medalists\n\n ## Athletics\n\n ### Men's competition\n\nEleven male athletes competed in track and field events on behalf of the Bahamas. Of those athletes, three participated in the 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay only (Williams, Moncur, Miller); five participated only in events other than the 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay (Atkins, Rolle, L. Sands, S. Sands, and Thomas), and three participated in both an individual event and the 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay. Of the individual events, Bahamian athletes were involved in six distinct events (100 meters, 40 meters, 200 meters, triple jump, 110 meters hurdles, and high jump). The two Bahamian medals won at Beijing were won by men in track and field events (4 \u00d7 400 meters relay and triple jump).\n\n #### Men's high jump\n\nDonald Thomas was the sole Bahamian athlete participating in the men's high jump event of the Beijing Olympics. During the event's qualification round on 17 August, Thomas was placed in the first heat versus competitors that included the Czech Republic's Jaroslav Baba and Great Britain's Germaine Mason. Thomas' best height cleared during this preliminary round was 2.20 meters, the same height as Israeli Nikita Palli; Pole Michal Bieniek; Syrian Majed Aldin Gazal; and American Dusty Jonas. However, Thomas tied Palli for twelfth place and scored ahead of Bieniek, Gazal and Jonas because Palli and Thomas had no misses at the high jump bar; the other three athletes did. Overall, Thomas tied Ukrainian Dmytro Dem'yanyuk and also Palli for twenty-first place out of the forty competing athletes. Thomas did not advance to the final round.\n\n #### Men's 200 meters\n\nJamaal Rolle (or Jamial Rolle) competed on behalf of the Bahamas in the men's 200 meters. Rolle was placed in the seventh heat of eight heats during the 17 August qualification round. Facing competitors that included the Dutch Antillean Churandy Martina, Azerbaijani Ramil Guliyev, and Nigerian Obinna Metu, Rolle ranked fifth out of eight athletes in his heat after completing his event in 20.93 seconds. Rolle scored ahead of sixth-place finalist Shingo Suetsugu of Japan, and behind fourth-place finalist Sandro Viana of Brazil, falling 0.09 seconds behind the latter. Overall, Rolle ranked thirty-fourth out of the sixty-six athletes who participated in the first round. He did not progress to further rounds.\n\n #### Men's 110 meters hurdles\n\nAuburn University graduate Shamar Sands reached the quarterfinals in the 110 meter hurdles.

He placed 0.04 seconds behind second-place heat finalist Qui\u00f1\u00f3nez, and 0.15  seconds behind heat leader Oliver. Overall, Sands ranked eighth out of the forty-three athletes who participated in the qualification round. Sands progressed to quarterfinals, where he was again placed in the second heat. Completing the event with a time of 13.55 seconds, Sands ranked seventh in the heat of eight athletes behind South Korea's Lee Jeong-Jun and ahead of Georgia's David Ilariani.

After a brief shoot-out, the dealers are taken into custody, and during the course of their confessions, reveal their supplier to be a man named Tony Amato.\n\nAmato (Bruce Willis) is an international arms dealer who the Federal Bureau of Investigation have been tracking, as they believe Amato is planning the sale of FIM-92 Stinger missiles stolen from a military arms depot. The FBI agrees to allow Metro-Dade to conduct the surveillance as its equipment was in place first. Crockett and Tubbs watch Amato's abusive relationship with his wife Rita (Katherine Borowitz). When Rita attempts to hire a hitman to kill Amato, Crockett intercepts the call and meets with her, arranging her help in their case in return for her safety. She explains that she has tried to leave Amato before, but he hired thugs to rape her divorce lawyer's wife to scare her into place.\n\nAmato's prospective buyer is intercepted and arrested. The FBI had initially planned to send one of their agents undercover in his place, but Tubbs volunteers for the role, fearing the agent is too inexperienced. Tubbs meets with Amato and his henchmen, who demonstrate one of the Stingers and explain how to take out a civilian airplane with an unarmed missile. Tubbs agrees to purchase all of Amato's inventory and arranges another meet to make the buy. That night, Crockett, surveilling Amato's house, sees him beat Rita again, and is unable to intervene.\n\nWhen Amato breaks his telephone in a rage, he finds one of the surveillance devices. Tubbs quickly calls him, claiming to have been bugged as well, and the two arrange to move the buy to that evening. Amato is noticeably on-edge during the meet, and is desperate to unload the missiles. The buy is set to take place at the docks, and the remainder of the Metro-Dade vice squad arrive with federal agents to complete the bust, taking Amato into custody safely.\n\nHowever, when Amato is due to be arraigned the next morning, a group of federal agents arrive with paperwork offering him immunity from prosecution in exchange for working for them to supply South American anti-Communist groups. Rita arrives to see Amato going free, draws a gun from her handbag, and shoots him.\n\n","h_score":1218408.9750000001,"h_score_cat":0,"pageid":11270263,"revid":1130572239,"description":null,"categories":["1984 American television episodes","Miami Vice"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 11\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

The following elements may be included in the rhythm dance: the dance lift, the dance spin, the step sequence, turn sequences, and choreographic elements, and in the rhythm dance, pattern dance elements.\n\nIllegal movements in the rhythm dance, the free dance, and in the pattern dances include the following, including the introductory and concluding steps, unless otherwise stated by the ISU:\n\n1. Sitting on the partner\u2019s head.\n2. Standing on the partner\u2019s shoulder.\n3. The lifted partner placed in an upside-down split pose, with a sustained angle of over 45 degrees between their thighs.\n4. The lifting partner swinging the lifted partner around by holding only their skate(s), boot(s), and\/or leg(s) with fully extended arm(s).\n5. The lifting partner swinging the lifted partner around without the assistance of their hand(s) and\/or arm(s) and the lifted partner holding only with their legs and\/or feet around the lifting partner\u2019s neck.\n6. The point of contact of the lifting hand(s) and\/or arm(s) of the lifting partner with any part of the body of the lifted partner is sustained with the fully extended arm(s) higher than the lifting partner\u2019s head, although the supporting arm may be sustained and fully extended above the head.\n7. Jumps of more than one revolution except during the jump entry and\/or jump exit.\n8. Lying on the ice.\n\nThe first six movements are permitted if they are not established and sustained, or if they are used only to change pose.\n\n ## Dance lifts\n\nThe ISU defines dance lifts as \"a movement in which one of the partners is elevated with active and\/or passive assistance of the other partner to any permitted height, sustained there and set down on the ice\".\n\nAfter the judging system changed from the 6.0 system to the ISU Judging System (IJS), dance lifts became more \"athletic, dramatic and exciting\". American ice dancer Charlie White stated that lifts have become \"increasingly difficult\", requiring teams to, like pair skaters, work with acrobats to develop their lifts. According to former competitive dancer Pilar Bosley, ice dance lifts rotate faster than pair lifts. In order to maximize the difficulty of the lifts, dancers must hit certain patterns and positions, with differences in entering and exiting their lifts. They have also become more acrobatic, despite the fact that they do not get as high as pair skating lifts because ice dance lifts cannot be supported over the man's shoulder. Dance lifts have also become more dangerous, resulting in more falls and injuries.\n\nThere are two types of dance lifts: short lifts, which should be done in under seven seconds; and combination lifts, which should be done in under 12 seconds. There are four types of short lifts: the stationary lift, the straight-line lift, the Curve lift, and the Rotational lift. There are three types of combination lifts: two Rotational lifts in different directions, two Curve lifts performed in a serpentine pattern, and different two types of short lifts performed together.\n\n ## Dance spins\n\nThe ISU defines a dance spin as \"a spin skated by the Couple together in any hold\". The ISU also states that the dance spin should be \"performed on the spot around a common axis on one foot with or without change(s) of foot by one or both partners\".\n\nDance spins have three positions. The upright position is done on one foot with the skating leg slightly bent or straight and with the upper body upright, bent to the side, or with an arched back. The sit position is done on one foot, with the \"skating leg bent in a one-legged crouch position and free leg forward, to the side or back. The camel position is done on one foot, with \"the skating leg straight or slightly bent and body bent forward and free leg extended or bent upward on a horizontal line or higher\".\n\n","h_score":0.0,"h_score_cat":0,"pageid":58079108,"revid":1128207809,"description":null,"categories":["Figure skating","Ice dance"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### The Graceful Battle: Competition Elements in Ice Dance\n\nIce dance competitions blend athletic prowess with artistic flair through elements like lifts, spins, and synchronized steps.

Step sequences have three divisions: types, groups, and styles.\n\nThere are two types of step sequences: not-touching or in hold. Not-touching step sequences must include matching and\/or mirror footwork; both ice dancers must skate as close to each other as possible, not more than two arm lengths apart, without touching, except when they are skating turns and edges in opposite directions for short distances. The dancers can switch from mirror to matching footwork, and vice versa, and they can cross each other's tracings (marks made on the ice by the skates). Step sequences in hold must be performed in any dance holds or any variation of dance holds, and must not last over one measure of music.\n\nTypes of step sequences are separated into three Groups. The first group (Group A) includes straight-line step sequences. There are two types of straight-line step sequences: midline, which is skated along the full length of the ice surface, on either its short or long axis; and diagonal, which is skated from corner to corner, as fully as possible. The second group (Group B) includes curved step sequences: circular, which can be skated in either a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction and must use the ice surface's full width; and serpentine, which can commence in either a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction and \"progresses in three bold curves or in two bold curves (S-Shaped) and ends at the Long Axis of the opposite end of the rink, with the pattern utilizing the full width of the ice surface\". The third group (Group C) includes partial step sequences, which are pattern dance-type step sequences and can be executed anywhere on the ice surface or prescribed by the ISU.\n\nCharacteristics of the levels of step sequences are organized as styles of step sequences, are technical requirements, and are published yearly in an ISU communication.\n\n ## Turn sequences\n\nTurn sequences are a required element in the rhythm dance and may be included in a well-balanced free dance program. Specific requirements for turn sequences are announced in an ISU communication each year. There are two types of turn sequences, a set of twizzles and a one-foot turns sequence. A set of twizzles can include two types: a set of synchronized twizzles, or a series of two twizzles for each partner, with up to four steps between the twizzles; and a set of sequential twizzles, or a series of two twizzles for each partner, with up to one step between the twizzles. The ISU states that for each type, each twizzle \"shall be at least one full rotation on one foot performed simultaneously (at the same time) by both partners\". The one-foot turns sequence is \"specified Turns performed on one foot by each partner simultaneously, in Hold or separately\".\n\n ### Twizzles\n\nThe ISU defines a twizzle as \"a traveling turn on one foot with one or more rotations which is quickly rotated with a continuous (uninterrupted) action\". It has also been defined as \"a multirotational, one-foot turn that moves across the ice\". Starting in the 2018-2019 season, dancers are judged individually on the execution of their twizzles; their individual points are combined for the team's final score for the element.\n\nA skater's weight, when performing the twizzle, \"remains on the skating foot with the free foot in any position during the turn then placed beside the skating foot to skate the next step\". The twizzle has four types of entry edges: the Forward Inside, the Forward Outside, the Backward Inside, and the Backward Outside.

Step sequences have three divisions: types, groups, and styles.\n\nThere are two types of step sequences: not-touching or in hold. Not-touching step sequences must include matching and\/or mirror footwork; both ice dancers must skate as close to each other as possible, not more than two arm lengths apart, without touching, except when they are skating turns and edges in opposite directions for short distances. The dancers can switch from mirror to matching footwork, and vice versa, and they can cross each other's tracings (marks made on the ice by the skates). Step sequences in hold must be performed in any dance holds or any variation of dance holds, and must not last over one measure of music.\n\nTypes of step sequences are separated into three Groups. The first group (Group A) includes straight-line step sequences. There are two types of straight-line step sequences: midline, which is skated along the full length of the ice surface, on either its short or long axis; and diagonal, which is skated from corner to corner, as fully as possible. The second group (Group B) includes curved step sequences: circular, which can be skated in either a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction and must use the ice surface's full width; and serpentine, which can commence in either a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction and \"progresses in three bold curves or in two bold curves (S-Shaped) and ends at the Long Axis of the opposite end of the rink, with the pattern utilizing the full width of the ice surface\". The third group (Group C) includes partial step sequences, which are pattern dance-type step sequences and can be executed anywhere on the ice surface or prescribed by the ISU.\n\nCharacteristics of the levels of step sequences are organized as styles of step sequences, are technical requirements, and are published yearly in an ISU communication.\n\n ## Turn sequences\n\nTurn sequences are a required element in the rhythm dance and may be included in a well-balanced free dance program. Specific requirements for turn sequences are announced in an ISU communication each year. There are two types of turn sequences, a set of twizzles and a one-foot turns sequence. A set of twizzles can include two types: a set of synchronized twizzles, or a series of two twizzles for each partner, with up to four steps between the twizzles; and a set of sequential twizzles, or a series of two twizzles for each partner, with up to one step between the twizzles. The ISU states that for each type, each twizzle \"shall be at least one full rotation on one foot performed simultaneously (at the same time) by both partners\". The one-foot turns sequence is \"specified Turns performed on one foot by each partner simultaneously, in Hold or separately\".\n\n ### Twizzles\n\nThe ISU defines a twizzle as \"a traveling turn on one foot with one or more rotations which is quickly rotated with a continuous (uninterrupted) action\". It has also been defined as \"a multirotational, one-foot turn that moves across the ice\". Starting in the 2018-2019 season, dancers are judged individually on the execution of their twizzles; their individual points are combined for the team's final score for the element.\n\nA skater's weight, when performing the twizzle, \"remains on the skating foot with the free foot in any position during the turn then placed beside the skating foot to skate the next step\".

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on July 11, 1991. In the episode, Mr. Burns falls ill and desperately needs a blood transfusion. Homer discovers Bart has Burns' rare blood type and urges him to donate, thinking the Simpsons will be handsomely rewarded. After receiving the blood transfusion, Burns sends them a card with no money. Marge convinces Homer not to send an insulting reply to his boss, but when Bart mails the letter anyway, Burns is livid. He later forgives Homer and sends the Simpsons a giant Olmec carving to show his gratitude.\n\nThe episode was written by George Meyer and directed by David Silverman. Executive producer Sam Simon and writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss came up with the idea for the episode. A co-worker had recently needed a blood transfusion, and the writers thought it would be funny if Mr. Burns had one. Although Meyer was credited with writing the episode, Jean and Reiss re-wrote and polished the script. The episode includes the debut of the Olmec head Xtapolapocetl, which would become a common background prop in the Simpson home.\n\n\"Blood Feud\" was part of the season two production run, but was completed behind schedule. It was originally broadcast on July 11, 1991, as part of \"premiere week\", the Fox Network's attempt to expand the typical 30-week prime time season and gain new viewers for the fall. In its original broadcast, the episode finished 24th in ratings for the week with a Nielsen rating of 10.8.\n\n","h_score":1430433.9187500002,"h_score_cat":2,"pageid":2105788,"revid":1150985433,"description":null,"categories":["1991 American television episodes","The Simpsons (season 2) episodes"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is \"Blood Feud\" in The Simpsons?  \nA1: It's a Season 7 episode where Bart donates blood to Mr. Burns, sparking a quirky chain of events.\n\nQ2: Who are the main characters involved?  \nA2: Bart Simpson and Mr. Burns lead, with Homer and the family adding comic chaos.\n\nQ3: What's the basic plot?  \nA3: Bart saves Burns with blood, leading to an awkward reward that escalates into family drama.\n\nQ4: Why is it called \"Blood Feud\"?  \nA4: The title plays on Bart's blood donation and the resulting conflict, blending literal and metaphorical rivalry.\n\nQ5: What themes does it explore?  \nA5: It touches on gratitude, social class, and mishaps in kindness, with humorous twists.\n\nQ6: How does it fit into the series?  \nA6: As a classic episode, it highlights The Simpsons' satire on everyday absurdities and family dynamics.\n\nQ7: What's a standout funny moment?  \nA7: Burns' over-the-top thank-you gift turns hilariously wrong, showcasing the show's witty edge.\n\nQ8: Why is it memorable?  \nA8: Its blend of heart and hilarity makes it a fan favorite, reflecting The Simpsons' enduring appeal."}

When Gregor's baby sister Boots falls through an old air duct grate in the building's basement, he dives in after her. The two fall miles below into the Underland: a subterranean world home to humans with near-translucent skin, violet eyes, and silver hair; giant sentient bats, rodents, and insects; and an escalating conflict between the human kingdom of Regalia and the rats' King Gorger. They meet several \"Underlanders\", among them the human Regalians' crown princess Luxa, who is Gregor's age, her cousin Henry, aged 14, and the bats who are \"bonded\" to them as warrior allies. At first, Gregor wants only to return home, but when he is attacked by two rats during an escape attempt and saved by the Underlanders, he inadvertently brings the conflict between the two groups to a head. It is then that he learns the real reason for the rats' hatred of Overlanders: a mysterious prophecy written by the human colony's founder Bartholomew of Sandwich hints that an Overland \"warrior\" will stop an attempt by the rats to take over the underground realm once and for all. The Regalian council believes Gregor to be this warrior, and tries to convince him to undertake the quest mentioned in the \"Prophecy of Gray\". Though he sympathizes, Gregor is reluctant to help until he learns a surprising fact: his father, who disappeared unexpectedly over two years before, had actually fallen down into Regalia just like Gregor and Boots and been taken prisoner by the rats. Gregor, his sister, and a group of Regalians go on a journey to rescue Gregor's father and recruit allies for a war against the rats. The quest group is challenged to successfully recruit allies for the Regalians, along the way facing battles with giant spiders, scorpions, and rats. The group of children are left in the care of the rat Ripred, who is a rebel against King Gorger. The group journeys to find Gregor's dad emaciated and tortured in the personal prison of King Gorger. When the rat king discovers their rescue attempt, Henry reveals that he has been helping the rats all along, hoping to ally them with the Regalians and genocide the weaker species of the realm. During the questers' attempt to escape, Gregor sacrifices himself to lure the rats' attack force \u2014 King Gorger and Henry among them \u2014 off the edge of a cliff. Henry's bat Ares, who had no knowledge of his bond's treachery, chooses to save Gregor rather than Henry as they fall. King Gorger, Henry, and hundreds of rats perish in the fall. When the few remaining quest members make it back to Regalia, Luxa and her family are devastated, both because of Henry's treason and death, and because Ares has been sentenced to banishment for allowing his bond to die. Gregor saves his life by using his status as the \"warrior\" to form a new bond with him. When things have settled down somewhat and the Regalian doctors have done all they can for his father, Gregor and his family return to the surface and reunite with his family.","h_score":1449511.9750000001,"h_score_cat":2,"pageid":4847916,"revid":1166194841,"description":"2003 book by Suzanne Collins","categories":["2003 American novels","2003 children's books","American children's novels","American fantasy novels","Children's fantasy novels","Novels set in New York (state)","Scholastic Corporation books","The Underland Chronicles"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Gregor the Overlander?  \nA1: It is a fantasy novel by Suzanne Collins about a boy discovering an underground world.  \n\nQ2: Who wrote it?  \nA2: Suzanne Collins authored it; she is known for young adult books.  \n\nQ3: What is the main plot?  \nA3: Gregor falls into the Underland and joins a quest against giant creatures.  \n\nQ4: Who is the protagonist?  \nA4: Gregor is a young boy from New York who embarks on adventures below ground.  \n\nQ5: What is the setting?  \nA5: The story occurs in the Underland, a subterranean world with diverse inhabitants.  \n\nQ6: What themes does it explore?  \nA6: It covers courage, family bonds, and survival in a perilous environment.  \n\nQ7: How does it relate to other books?  \nA7: It's the first in a series and shares Collins' style with The Hunger Games.  \n\nQ8: Why is it popular?  \nA8: It appeals to kids with its adventure and moral lessons, influencing young readers."}

When Gregor's baby sister Boots falls through an old air duct grate in the building's basement, he dives in after her. The two fall miles below into the Underland: a subterranean world home to humans with near-translucent skin, violet eyes, and silver hair; giant sentient bats, rodents, and insects; and an escalating conflict between the human kingdom of Regalia and the rats' King Gorger. They meet several \"Underlanders\", among them the human Regalians' crown princess Luxa, who is Gregor's age, her cousin Henry, aged 14, and the bats who are \"bonded\" to them as warrior allies. At first, Gregor wants only to return home, but when he is attacked by two rats during an escape attempt and saved by the Underlanders, he inadvertently brings the conflict between the two groups to a head. It is then that he learns the real reason for the rats' hatred of Overlanders: a mysterious prophecy written by the human colony's founder Bartholomew of Sandwich hints that an Overland \"warrior\" will stop an attempt by the rats to take over the underground realm once and for all. The Regalian council believes Gregor to be this warrior, and tries to convince him to undertake the quest mentioned in the \"Prophecy of Gray\". Though he sympathizes, Gregor is reluctant to help until he learns a surprising fact: his father, who disappeared unexpectedly over two years before, had actually fallen down into Regalia just like Gregor and Boots and been taken prisoner by the rats. Gregor, his sister, and a group of Regalians go on a journey to rescue Gregor's father and recruit allies for a war against the rats. The quest group is challenged to successfully recruit allies for the Regalians, along the way facing battles with giant spiders, scorpions, and rats. The group of children are left in the care of the rat Ripred, who is a rebel against King Gorger. The group journeys to find Gregor's dad emaciated and tortured in the personal prison of King Gorger. When the rat king discovers their rescue attempt, Henry reveals that he has been helping the rats all along, hoping to ally them with the Regalians and genocide the weaker species of the realm. During the questers' attempt to escape, Gregor sacrifices himself to lure the rats' attack force \u2014 King Gorger and Henry among them \u2014 off the edge of a cliff. Henry's bat Ares, who had no knowledge of his bond's treachery, chooses to save Gregor rather than Henry as they fall. King Gorger, Henry, and hundreds of rats perish in the fall. When the few remaining quest members make it back to Regalia, Luxa and her family are devastated, both because of Henry's treason and death, and because Ares has been sentenced to banishment for allowing his bond to die. Gregor saves his life by using his status as the \"warrior\" to form a new bond with him. When things have settled down somewhat and the Regalian doctors have done all they can for his father, Gregor and his family return to the surface and reunite with his family.","h_score":1449511.9750000001,"h_score_cat":2,"pageid":4847916,"revid":1166194841,"description":"2003 book by Suzanne Collins","categories":["2003 American novels","2003 children's books","American children's novels","American fantasy novels","Children's fantasy novels","Novels set in New York (state)","Scholastic Corporation books","The Underland Chronicles"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Gregor the Overlander: A Boy's Epic Underground Quest\n\nIn Suzanne Collins' beloved novel, a young boy named Gregor falls into a mysterious subterranean world teeming with giant creatures and ancient prophecies.

The phrase \"white water runs red\" refers specifically to how the humans deposit the bodies of two rats who try to kill Gregor into a fast-flowing river beneath the Regalian palace. \"Hope of the hopeless\" may be interpreted as a reference to Gregor, who refuses to \"allow himself to think about the future at all\", because it makes him sad as he has made rule, thinking if he thinks good thoughts they are never to happen. He made this rule after he lost his father.\n\nAn Overlander warrior, a son of the sun,\nMay bring us back light, he may bring us back none.\nBut gather your neighbors and follow his call\nOr rats will most surely devour us all.\n\nMeaning: Gregor is an Overlander and the son of another fallen Overlander (thus a \"son\" of the \"sun\", in multiple ways).

He may be interpreted as controlling the \"fate of the eight\" because of his powerful connection with the rats, whom he could have manipulated had he lived.

Pro-Am II is a racing video game in which four vehicles compete on a series of 24 different tracks: eight standard racetracks, eight \"cityscape\" tracks, and eight offroad tracks. The difficulty level increases between each type of course. Players must navigate around course obstacles to finish the race. In the single-player mode, the players races against three artificial intelligence opponents. The game also has a multiplayer mode in which up to four human players can race against each other. The objective of each race is to finish in the top three places to receive race points and money, which is used to upgrade vehicles and buy weapons. The top three finishers are qualified to participate in the next race while other players must use a continue. The game ends when the players run out of continues.\n\nPlayers steer with the directional pad, accelerate with one button, and fire their weapon with the other. Before each race, players can use money earned from previous races to buy vehicle performance upgrades and weapons, which can be used on other competitors. Upgrades and weapons include the following: motors (increased speed); tires (better turning); missiles, bombs, and \"freeze beams\"; and buckshots (steal opponents' cash).

For example, in the Epipaleolithic of the Levant, between c. 14,500 and 11,500 BP, both waterfowl and migratory birds were eaten. Archaeologists have studied the return in terms of energy from captured food compared to the energy expended to capture it; birds provide a smaller return than larger game such as deer, but better than many plant materials. For example, waterfowl captured in a drive can yield a return of around 2,000 kcal\/hour, whereas an antelope can yield as much as 31,000 kcal\/hour, and wild rye around 1,000 kcal\/hour.\n\nBirds have been domesticated and bred as poultry for use as food for at least four thousand years. The most important species is the chicken. It appears to have been domesticated by 5000 BC in northeastern China, likely for cockfighting, and only later used for food. In ancient Egypt, poultry including ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and then bred in captivity.\n\nChicken now provides some 20% of the animal protein eaten by the world's human population in the form of meat and eggs. Chickens are often raised intensively in battery farms; this facilitates production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds. Other species including ducks, geese, pheasants, guineafowl and turkeys are significant economically around the world. Less commonly raised species such as the Common ostrich are starting to be farmed for their meat, which is low in cholesterol; they have also been kept for their feathers, and for leather from their skin.\n\nBirds are hunted in many countries around the world. In the developed world, ducks such as mallard, wigeon, shoveler and teal have for centuries been captured by wildfowlers, while pheasants, partridges, grouse, and snipe are among the terrestrial birds that are hunted for sport, generally with guns. In other parts of the world, traditional subsistence hunting still continues, as in rural Northern Papua, where cassowaries, crowned pigeons, hornbills and megapodes are captured for food. Seabirds such as muttonbirds, penguins and auks have been hunted for food, formerly with sufficient intensity to threaten many populations and to make some, such as the great auk, extinct. Seabird hunting continues at more moderate levels today, for instance with the traditional M\u0101ori harvest of sooty shearwater chicks.\n\n ### Assisting hunters and gatherers\n\nThe archaeological and historical records suggest interdependence between humans and vultures for millions of years. Like other animal species, early hominins probably used these birds as beacons signalling the location of meat, in the form of carcasses, in the landscape.\n\nCormorant fishing is a traditional fishing method in which trained cormorants are used to catch fish in rivers. Historically, cormorant fishing has taken place in Japan and China since about 960 AD.\n\nThe greater honeyguide guides people in some parts of Africa to the nests of wild bees. A guiding bird attracts a person's attention with a chattering call, and flies in short bounds towards a bees' nest. When the human honey-hunter has taken their honey, the honeyguide eats what is left. The Boran people of East Africa use a specific whistle, which doubles the encounter rate with honeyguides; they find that using a honeyguide reduces the time to find honey by two-thirds. The Bushmen of the Kalahari thank the honeyguide with a gift of honey.\n\n ### Materials\n\nFeathers are used to make warm and soft bedding, including eiderdowns from the belly down of the eider duck, and winter clothing as they have high \"loft\", trapping a large amount of air for their weight. Feathers were used also for quill pens, for fletching arrows, and to decorate fishing lures.\n\nBird bones were used by Stone Age peoples to make awls and other tools. Guano, the droppings of seabirds, rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, was once important as an agricultural fertiliser and is still used in organic farming. The War of the Pacific in 1865 was in part about which country had control of the territory containing valuable guano sources. Today, birds such as the chicken and the Japanese quail are used as model organisms in ornithological and more generally in biological research, for instance in toxicology.\n\n ### Clothing and fashion\n\nFeathers have been important and colourful items of clothing and fashion from before the birth of civilisation. Elaborate, brightly coloured headdresses containing feathers are worn by indigenous peoples of the Americas such as the Bororo of the Mato Grosso. In Polynesia, sega ula lory bird feathers were major trade items, used to decorate high quality mats in Samoa and Tonga. The use of bird skins for Inuit clothing has been documented across all Inuit groups, although it was most common in the eastern and western Arctic, where larger animals like caribou were less available.\n\nIn Western culture, feathers are used in boas and decorating elaborate hats and other items of ladies' clothing. Feathers in fashion were a status symbol well into the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The Belle Epoque draped its clothing in feathers as ornaments. The Hudson's Bay Company of Canada traded in swans and sometimes geese, for their skins and quills in the 18th and 19th centuries; the skins were then sent to Europe. Ostrich plumes were a luxury commodity in Europe for centuries, leading to serious harm to wild ostrich populations, and subsequent establishment of ostrich farms. Classical 1930s Hollywood films used feathers in abundance, arguably as a metaphor for female sexuality. For example, in the 1935 musical Top Hat, Ginger Rogers danced \"Cheek to Cheek\" covered in white plumes that emphasised her movements. Late twentieth century designers such as Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen used feathers to make fashion statements.\n\n ### Sports and hobbies\n\nRaptors from eagles to small falcons have for centuries been used in falconry, often to catch other birds, whether for pleasure or for food.\n\nCockfighting is an ancient spectator sport. It formed part of the culture of the ancient Indians, Chinese, Greeks, and Romans. It continues to be practised in South America and across South and Southeast Asia, often combined with betting on the result. It is practised in religious ceremonies in Hindu temples in Bali, but is now banned in many countries on grounds of cruelty.\n\nPigeon racing involves releasing specially trained racing pigeons to return to their homes over a measured distance of between 100 and 1,000 kilometres (62 and 621 mi). The sport was popularised in Belgium in the 19th century, and is now competitive worldwide. Also in Belgium and Flanders is vinkensport, in which participants have male chaffinches compete to make the most bird calls in an hour.\n\nBirdwatching has since the nineteenth century become a major leisure activity. Millions of people around the world, amounting to nearly half of all households in some developed countries, put out birdfeeders to attract birds to their gardens or windowsills, at a cost of billions of dollars each year.\n\n ### As pets\n\nCagebirds such as canaries, budgerigars, cockatoos, lovebirds, quails, finches, and parrots are popular pets, whether for their song, their behaviour, their colourful plumage, or their ability to mimic speech. Among reasons for their popularity is that they can be kept in homes too small or otherwise unsuitable for dogs or cats. The cagebird trade in some parts of the world threatens certain species with extinction, when birds are illegally captured in the wild. For example, in Indonesia, at least 13 species are close to extinction including the Indonesian national bird, the Javan hawk-eagle, while five subspecies including the scarlet-breasted lorikeet may have become extinct in the wild.\n\nPet birds are kept in their millions, as are domestic fowls, bantams, and pigeons. These last had an important effect on evolutionary biology, as Charles Darwin took an especial interest in pigeon fancying, adopted the hobby himself, and made use of the wide variation between breeds as an argument for the power of selection in his 1859 Origin of Species.\n\n ## Symbolic uses\n\n","h_score":1442422.175,"h_score_cat":2,"pageid":50262203,"revid":1156374707,"description":"Overview of humans' uses of birds","categories":["Animals in culture","Biology and culture","Birds and humans","Birds in art","Birds in mythology"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"FACTUAL","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What are common human uses of birds?  \nA1: Birds provide food like meat and eggs.

In other parts of the world, traditional subsistence hunting still continues, as in rural Northern Papua, where cassowaries, crowned pigeons, hornbills and megapodes are captured for food. Seabirds such as muttonbirds, penguins and auks have been hunted for food, formerly with sufficient intensity to threaten many populations and to make some, such as the great auk, extinct. Seabird hunting continues at more moderate levels today, for instance with the traditional M\u0101ori harvest of sooty shearwater chicks.\n\n ### Assisting hunters and gatherers\n\nThe archaeological and historical records suggest interdependence between humans and vultures for millions of years. Like other animal species, early hominins probably used these birds as beacons signalling the location of meat, in the form of carcasses, in the landscape.\n\nCormorant fishing is a traditional fishing method in which trained cormorants are used to catch fish in rivers. Historically, cormorant fishing has taken place in Japan and China since about 960 AD.\n\nThe greater honeyguide guides people in some parts of Africa to the nests of wild bees. A guiding bird attracts a person's attention with a chattering call, and flies in short bounds towards a bees' nest. When the human honey-hunter has taken their honey, the honeyguide eats what is left. The Boran people of East Africa use a specific whistle, which doubles the encounter rate with honeyguides; they find that using a honeyguide reduces the time to find honey by two-thirds. The Bushmen of the Kalahari thank the honeyguide with a gift of honey.\n\n ### Materials\n\nFeathers are used to make warm and soft bedding, including eiderdowns from the belly down of the eider duck, and winter clothing as they have high \"loft\", trapping a large amount of air for their weight. Feathers were used also for quill pens, for fletching arrows, and to decorate fishing lures.\n\nBird bones were used by Stone Age peoples to make awls and other tools. Guano, the droppings of seabirds, rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, was once important as an agricultural fertiliser and is still used in organic farming. The War of the Pacific in 1865 was in part about which country had control of the territory containing valuable guano sources. Today, birds such as the chicken and the Japanese quail are used as model organisms in ornithological and more generally in biological research, for instance in toxicology.\n\n ### Clothing and fashion\n\nFeathers have been important and colourful items of clothing and fashion from before the birth of civilisation. Elaborate, brightly coloured headdresses containing feathers are worn by indigenous peoples of the Americas such as the Bororo of the Mato Grosso. In Polynesia, sega ula lory bird feathers were major trade items, used to decorate high quality mats in Samoa and Tonga. The use of bird skins for Inuit clothing has been documented across all Inuit groups, although it was most common in the eastern and western Arctic, where larger animals like caribou were less available.\n\nIn Western culture, feathers are used in boas and decorating elaborate hats and other items of ladies' clothing. Feathers in fashion were a status symbol well into the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The Belle Epoque draped its clothing in feathers as ornaments. The Hudson's Bay Company of Canada traded in swans and sometimes geese, for their skins and quills in the 18th and 19th centuries; the skins were then sent to Europe. Ostrich plumes were a luxury commodity in Europe for centuries, leading to serious harm to wild ostrich populations, and subsequent establishment of ostrich farms. Classical 1930s Hollywood films used feathers in abundance, arguably as a metaphor for female sexuality. For example, in the 1935 musical Top Hat, Ginger Rogers danced \"Cheek to Cheek\" covered in white plumes that emphasised her movements. Late twentieth century designers such as Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen used feathers to make fashion statements.\n\n ### Sports and hobbies\n\nRaptors from eagles to small falcons have for centuries been used in falconry, often to catch other birds, whether for pleasure or for food.\n\nCockfighting is an ancient spectator sport. It formed part of the culture of the ancient Indians, Chinese, Greeks, and Romans. It continues to be practised in South America and across South and Southeast Asia, often combined with betting on the result. It is practised in religious ceremonies in Hindu temples in Bali, but is now banned in many countries on grounds of cruelty.\n\nPigeon racing involves releasing specially trained racing pigeons to return to their homes over a measured distance of between 100 and 1,000 kilometres (62 and 621 mi). The sport was popularised in Belgium in the 19th century, and is now competitive worldwide. Also in Belgium and Flanders is vinkensport, in which participants have male chaffinches compete to make the most bird calls in an hour.\n\nBirdwatching has since the nineteenth century become a major leisure activity. Millions of people around the world, amounting to nearly half of all households in some developed countries, put out birdfeeders to attract birds to their gardens or windowsills, at a cost of billions of dollars each year.\n\n ### As pets\n\nCagebirds such as canaries, budgerigars, cockatoos, lovebirds, quails, finches, and parrots are popular pets, whether for their song, their behaviour, their colourful plumage, or their ability to mimic speech. Among reasons for their popularity is that they can be kept in homes too small or otherwise unsuitable for dogs or cats. The cagebird trade in some parts of the world threatens certain species with extinction, when birds are illegally captured in the wild. For example, in Indonesia, at least 13 species are close to extinction including the Indonesian national bird, the Javan hawk-eagle, while five subspecies including the scarlet-breasted lorikeet may have become extinct in the wild.\n\nPet birds are kept in their millions, as are domestic fowls, bantams, and pigeons. These last had an important effect on evolutionary biology, as Charles Darwin took an especial interest in pigeon fancying, adopted the hobby himself, and made use of the wide variation between breeds as an argument for the power of selection in his 1859 Origin of Species.\n\n ## Symbolic uses\n\n","h_score":1442422.175,"h_score_cat":2,"pageid":50262203,"revid":1156374707,"description":"Overview of humans' uses of birds","categories":["Animals in culture","Biology and culture","Birds and humans","Birds in art","Birds in mythology"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What are birds good for in daily life?  \nA1: Feathers for pillows, eggs for breakfast\u2014humans pluck and crack with glee.\n\nQ2: How do we eat birds?  \nA2: Grilled chickens dance on plates, turkeys parade for feasts\u2014delicious, ancient rituals.\n\nQ3: Are birds kept as pets?  \nA3: Parrots mimic words like cheeky echoes, canaries sing in gilded cages\u2014companions with flair.\n\nQ4: What about birds in symbols?  \nA4: Eagles soar on flags as freedom's wings, owls wink in wisdom tales\u2014iconic flights.\n\nQ5: Do birds help science?  \nA5: Migratory paths map climate clues, DNA unravels evolution's quirks\u2014feathery labs alive.\n\nQ6: How are birds used economically?  \nA6: Feathers fashion hats, guano fertilizes fields\u2014profitable plumes and poops.\n\nQ7: What's the historical angle?  \nA7: Ancient Egyptians mummified sacred ibises, messengers carried scrolls\u2014birds as time's couriers.\n\nQ8: Any ethical concerns today?  \nA8: Poaching threatens vibrant species, conservation fights back\u2014balancing use with winged wonders' rights."}

Birds have featured as gods from the time of ancient Egypt, where the sacred ibis was venerated as a symbol of the god Thoth. In India, the peacock is perceived as Mother Earth among Dravidian peoples, while the Mughal and Persian emperors displayed their godlike authority by sitting in a Peacock Throne. In the Yazidi religion, Melek Taus the \"Peacock Angel\" is the central figure of their faith. In the cult of Makemake, the Tangata manu birds of Easter Island served as chiefs. Birds have been seen as spirit messengers of the gods. In Norse mythology, Hugin and Munin were ravens who whispered news into the ears of the god Odin. In the Etruscan and Roman religions of ancient Italy, priests were involved in augury, interpreting the words of birds while the \"auspex\" watched their activities to foretell events. In the Inca and Tiwanaku empires of South America, birds are depicted transgressing the boundaries between the earthly and underground spiritual realms. Indigenous peoples of the central Andes maintain legends of birds passing to and from metaphysical worlds. The mythical chullumpi bird is said to mark the existence of a portal between such worlds, and to transform itself into a llama. Among the Parsees of India and Iran, and among practitioners of Vajrayana Buddhism who believe in the transmigration of souls in Sikkim, Mongolia, Bhutan and Nepal, sky burial has been practiced for centuries. In this ritual, corpses are left exposed for griffon vultures to pick clean. The practice is declining, not least because of the loss of most of the vulture population across South Asia to accidental poisoning by the anti-inflammatory veterinary drug diclofenac. Birds have sometimes served as religious symbols. In ancient Mesopotamia, doves were prominent animal symbols of Inanna (later known as Ishtar), the goddess of love, sexuality, and war, and, in the ancient Levant, doves were used as symbols for the Canaanite mother goddess Asherah. In ancient Greece, Athena, the goddess of wisdom and patron deity of the city of Athens, had a little owl as her symbol. In Greek iconography, Athena is often shown accompanied by an owl and the owl was used as a symbol of Athens on Athenian coinage. In classical antiquity, doves were sacred to the Greek goddess Aphrodite, who absorbed this association with doves from Inanna-Ishtar. Aphrodite frequently appears with doves in ancient Greek pottery and, during Aphrodite's main festival, the Aphrodisia, her altars would be purified with the blood of a sacrificed dove. In Medieval Christian iconography, the cormorant's \"wing-drying\" pose represents the Christian cross, and hence is a figure of Christ. In John Milton's Paradise Lost, on the other hand, the bird's cross-like pose is a travesty of Christ: \"Then up he flew, and... Sat like a cormorant; yet not true life Thereby regained, but sat devising death To them who lived\". In mythology, birds were sometimes monsters, like the Roc and the M\u0101ori's Pou\u0101kai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans. In Persian mythology, the simurgh was a gigantic bird, the first to come into existence, and it nested on the tree of plant life that grew in the great ocean beside the tree of immortality. Its task was to shake the seeds of all the plants out of the tree. ### In the arts\n\nBirds have been depicted throughout the arts from the earliest times to the present, including in painting and sculpture, in literature, in music, in theatre, in traditional dance and ballet, and in film.\n\n #### Painting and sculpture\n\nBirds have been depicted in paintings, sculptures and other art objects from the earliest times, including in cave paintings.\n\nIn Chinese art, bird-and-flower painting forms one of the three major subjects (the others being landscapes and figures), from the time of the Five Dynasties in the 10th century. Huang Quan created the naturalistic xiesheng style for bird paintings. Birds have long been celebrated in the arts of Japan, including in painting, woodblock printing, cloisonn\u00e9, ceramics and indeed poetry from the 18th and 19th centuries. Print artists like Utamaro and Hokusai made use of Western and Chinese influences to give a sophisticated effect, while Hiroshige reworked the traditional bird-and-flower genre.\n\nIn modern art, some of the paintings of Joan Mir\u00f3 include \"A tangle of lines and small, colored ideograms suggesting birds, allegorical characters, stars, and animals\". In modern sculpture, Pablo Picasso's 1932 bronze Coq (Cockerel) is an assemblage of \"spiky, elongated forms.\"\n\nIn public statuary, the Magyars's mythical Turul symbolises national power and nobility, and is represented by many statues in Hungary, including the largest bird statue in the world, on a mountain near Tatab\u00e1nya.\n\n #### Poetry\n\nBirds have been celebrated in poetry since ancient times, when for example the Roman poet Catullus wrote in one of his most famous works about a girl and her pet sparrow in Passer, deliciae meae puellae, \"Sparrow, delight of my girl\".\n\nBirds featured in medieval poetry, for example forming the characters of the 1177 Persian poem The Conference of the Birds, where the birds of the world assemble under the wisest bird, the hoopoe, to decide who is to be their king.\n\nIn English romantic poetry, John Keats's 1819 \"Ode to a Nightingale\" and Percy Bysshe Shelley's 1820 \"To a Skylark\" are popular classics. Bird poems by Gerard Manley Hopkins include \"Sea and Skylark\" and \"The Windhover\" (on the kestrel). More recently, Ted Hughes's 1970 collection of poems about a bird character, \"Crow\", is considered one of his most important works.\n\n","h_score":1442422.175,"h_score_cat":2,"pageid":50262203,"revid":1156374707,"description":"Overview of humans' uses of birds","categories":["Animals in culture","Biology and culture","Birds and humans","Birds in art","Birds in mythology"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Birds: Feathered Partners in Human Life\n\nThroughout history, humans have utilized birds for food, companionship, and cultural symbols, shaping societies worldwide.

It is practised in religious ceremonies in Hindu temples in Bali, but is now banned in many countries on grounds of cruelty.\n\nPigeon racing involves releasing specially trained racing pigeons to return to their homes over a measured distance of between 100 and 1,000 kilometres (62 and 621 mi). The sport was popularised in Belgium in the 19th century, and is now competitive worldwide. Also in Belgium and Flanders is vinkensport, in which participants have male chaffinches compete to make the most bird calls in an hour.\n\nBirdwatching has since the nineteenth century become a major leisure activity. Millions of people around the world, amounting to nearly half of all households in some developed countries, put out birdfeeders to attract birds to their gardens or windowsills, at a cost of billions of dollars each year.\n\n ### As pets\n\nCagebirds such as canaries, budgerigars, cockatoos, lovebirds, quails, finches, and parrots are popular pets, whether for their song, their behaviour, their colourful plumage, or their ability to mimic speech. Among reasons for their popularity is that they can be kept in homes too small or otherwise unsuitable for dogs or cats. The cagebird trade in some parts of the world threatens certain species with extinction, when birds are illegally captured in the wild. For example, in Indonesia, at least 13 species are close to extinction including the Indonesian national bird, the Javan hawk-eagle, while five subspecies including the scarlet-breasted lorikeet may have become extinct in the wild.\n\nPet birds are kept in their millions, as are domestic fowls, bantams, and pigeons. These last had an important effect on evolutionary biology, as Charles Darwin took an especial interest in pigeon fancying, adopted the hobby himself, and made use of the wide variation between breeds as an argument for the power of selection in his 1859 Origin of Species.\n\n ## Symbolic uses\n\n","h_score":1442422.175,"h_score_cat":2,"pageid":50262203,"revid":1156374707,"description":"Overview of humans' uses of birds","categories":["Animals in culture","Biology and culture","Birds and humans","Birds in art","Birds in mythology"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Birds: Feathered Allies in Human Hands\n\nHumans have ingeniously woven birds into daily life, from ancient feasts to modern tech mimics.

Birds have featured as gods from the time of ancient Egypt, where the sacred ibis was venerated as a symbol of the god Thoth. In India, the peacock is perceived as Mother Earth among Dravidian peoples, while the Mughal and Persian emperors displayed their godlike authority by sitting in a Peacock Throne. In the Yazidi religion, Melek Taus the \"Peacock Angel\" is the central figure of their faith. In the cult of Makemake, the Tangata manu birds of Easter Island served as chiefs. Birds have been seen as spirit messengers of the gods. In Norse mythology, Hugin and Munin were ravens who whispered news into the ears of the god Odin. In the Etruscan and Roman religions of ancient Italy, priests were involved in augury, interpreting the words of birds while the \"auspex\" watched their activities to foretell events. In the Inca and Tiwanaku empires of South America, birds are depicted transgressing the boundaries between the earthly and underground spiritual realms. Indigenous peoples of the central Andes maintain legends of birds passing to and from metaphysical worlds. The mythical chullumpi bird is said to mark the existence of a portal between such worlds, and to transform itself into a llama. Among the Parsees of India and Iran, and among practitioners of Vajrayana Buddhism who believe in the transmigration of souls in Sikkim, Mongolia, Bhutan and Nepal, sky burial has been practiced for centuries. In this ritual, corpses are left exposed for griffon vultures to pick clean. The practice is declining, not least because of the loss of most of the vulture population across South Asia to accidental poisoning by the anti-inflammatory veterinary drug diclofenac. Birds have sometimes served as religious symbols. In ancient Mesopotamia, doves were prominent animal symbols of Inanna (later known as Ishtar), the goddess of love, sexuality, and war, and, in the ancient Levant, doves were used as symbols for the Canaanite mother goddess Asherah. In ancient Greece, Athena, the goddess of wisdom and patron deity of the city of Athens, had a little owl as her symbol. In Greek iconography, Athena is often shown accompanied by an owl and the owl was used as a symbol of Athens on Athenian coinage. In classical antiquity, doves were sacred to the Greek goddess Aphrodite, who absorbed this association with doves from Inanna-Ishtar. Aphrodite frequently appears with doves in ancient Greek pottery and, during Aphrodite's main festival, the Aphrodisia, her altars would be purified with the blood of a sacrificed dove. In Medieval Christian iconography, the cormorant's \"wing-drying\" pose represents the Christian cross, and hence is a figure of Christ. In John Milton's Paradise Lost, on the other hand, the bird's cross-like pose is a travesty of Christ: \"Then up he flew, and... Sat like a cormorant; yet not true life Thereby regained, but sat devising death To them who lived\". In mythology, birds were sometimes monsters, like the Roc and the M\u0101ori's Pou\u0101kai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans. In Persian mythology, the simurgh was a gigantic bird, the first to come into existence, and it nested on the tree of plant life that grew in the great ocean beside the tree of immortality. Its task was to shake the seeds of all the plants out of the tree. ### In the arts\n\nBirds have been depicted throughout the arts from the earliest times to the present, including in painting and sculpture, in literature, in music, in theatre, in traditional dance and ballet, and in film.\n\n #### Painting and sculpture\n\nBirds have been depicted in paintings, sculptures and other art objects from the earliest times, including in cave paintings.\n\nIn Chinese art, bird-and-flower painting forms one of the three major subjects (the others being landscapes and figures), from the time of the Five Dynasties in the 10th century. Huang Quan created the naturalistic xiesheng style for bird paintings. Birds have long been celebrated in the arts of Japan, including in painting, woodblock printing, cloisonn\u00e9, ceramics and indeed poetry from the 18th and 19th centuries. Print artists like Utamaro and Hokusai made use of Western and Chinese influences to give a sophisticated effect, while Hiroshige reworked the traditional bird-and-flower genre.\n\nIn modern art, some of the paintings of Joan Mir\u00f3 include \"A tangle of lines and small, colored ideograms suggesting birds, allegorical characters, stars, and animals\". In modern sculpture, Pablo Picasso's 1932 bronze Coq (Cockerel) is an assemblage of \"spiky, elongated forms.\"\n\nIn public statuary, the Magyars's mythical Turul symbolises national power and nobility, and is represented by many statues in Hungary, including the largest bird statue in the world, on a mountain near Tatab\u00e1nya.\n\n #### Poetry\n\nBirds have been celebrated in poetry since ancient times, when for example the Roman poet Catullus wrote in one of his most famous works about a girl and her pet sparrow in Passer, deliciae meae puellae, \"Sparrow, delight of my girl\".\n\nBirds featured in medieval poetry, for example forming the characters of the 1177 Persian poem The Conference of the Birds, where the birds of the world assemble under the wisest bird, the hoopoe, to decide who is to be their king.\n\nIn English romantic poetry, John Keats's 1819 \"Ode to a Nightingale\" and Percy Bysshe Shelley's 1820 \"To a Skylark\" are popular classics. Bird poems by Gerard Manley Hopkins include \"Sea and Skylark\" and \"The Windhover\" (on the kestrel). More recently, Ted Hughes's 1970 collection of poems about a bird character, \"Crow\", is considered one of his most important works.\n\n","h_score":1442422.175,"h_score_cat":2,"pageid":50262203,"revid":1156374707,"description":"Overview of humans' uses of birds","categories":["Animals in culture","Biology and culture","Birds and humans","Birds in art","Birds in mythology"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 5\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

The winning design, by Constructor, First Class (Ing\u00e9nieur de 1\u00e8re classe) Charles Radiguer, was optimized for good sea-keeping qualities and high speed with moderate buoyancy, a long, thin single hull, and high freeboard. The most unusual feature of his design was the prominent forecastle that was built atop the forward part of the pressure hull, while the rear was virtually awash. This odd configuration gave the boat her nickname of toothbrush (brosse \u00e0 dents). The submarine actually displaced slightly more than planned, 545 metric tons (536 long tons) surfaced and 634 metric tons (624 long tons) submerged. She measured 64.75 meters (212 ft 5 in) between perpendiculars and had a beam of 4.3 meters (14 ft 1 in). Mariotte had a maximum draft of 3.82 meters (12 ft 6 in) and had a depth of 7.25 meters (23 ft 9 in) from the bottom of her keel to the top of the conning tower. This latter was faired into the rear of the forecastle. Two lead weights were located in the keel and could be dropped in an emergency. Her hull was divided into nine compartments and she was fitted with five internal trim tanks, an internal central ballast tank and three external ballast tanks. She had a test depth of 35 meters (115 ft). Mariotte had two rudders, one above the waterline for submerged use and the other below the waterline for regular use. She had two sets of diving planes, fore and aft, to control her depth below the water. The boat was evaluated in 1914 and the commission felt that she was generally successful except for her surface speed and range. It noted that she had problems with a following sea as the superstructure rapidly filled with water, but drained slowly so that she was much heavier by the bow and would tend to wallow. It also felt that she was insufficiently buoyant and had mediocre stability on the surface. For surface running, the boat was powered by two Sautter & Harl\u00e9 six-cylinder, 700-metric-horsepower (690 bhp; 515 kW) diesel engines, each driving a 1.72-meter (5 ft 8 in) propeller. When submerged each propeller was driven by a Breguet 500-metric-horsepower (493 shp; 368 kW) electric motor using electricity from two 124-cell batteries. Mariotte could reach 14.2 knots (26.3 km\/h; 16. 3 mph) on the surface and 11.7 knots (21.7 km\/h; 13. 5 mph) underwater. This latter speed was a record that would not be exceeded by a French submarine for 35 years. On the surface, the boat had a range of 1,658 nmi (3,071 km; 1,908 mi) at 10 knots (19 km\/h; 12 mph), submerged, she had a range of 143 nmi (265 km; 165 mi) at 5 knots (9.3 km\/h; 5. 8 mph). She was armed with four internal 45 cm (17.7 in) torpedo tubes in the bow and two Drzewiecki drop collars in the forecastle. Two reloads were stowed internally, which gave her a total of eight torpedoes. During World War I, the boat probably used Mod\u00e8le 1911V torpedoes. These had a 110-kilogram (240 lb) warhead and a range of 2,000 meters (2,200 yd) at a speed of 36 knots (67 km\/h; 41 mph).","h_score":2.8356347084,"h_score_cat":0,"pageid":47096553,"revid":1136274351,"description":"French Navy's submarine","categories":["1911 ships","Maritime incidents in 1915","Scuttled vessels","Ships built in France","Shipwrecks of Turkey","World War I shipwrecks in the Dardanelles","World War I submarines of France"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What was the French submarine Mariotte?  \nA1: The Mariotte was a Pluvi\u00f4se-class submarine built for the French Navy, symbolizing early 20th-century underwater innovation.  \n\nQ2: When was it launched?  \nA2: Launched in 1912, it patrolled the seas during World War I, a sleek guardian of the depths.  \n\nQ3: What was its primary role?  \nA3: It focused on coastal defense and reconnaissance, gliding silently through waves to spot enemy ships.  \n\nQ4: How did it perform in combat?  \nA4: The Mariotte engaged in patrols but met a tragic end in 1916, sunk by a mine amid wartime chaos.  \n\nQ5: What were its key features?  \nA5: Featuring a diesel-electric engine, it boasted modest speed and depth capabilities, a marvel of its era's engineering.  \n\nQ6: How did it impact French naval strategy?  \nA6: It highlighted submarine potential for stealth attacks, subtly shifting tactics toward undersea warfare.  \n\nQ7: What challenges did it face?  \nA7: Limited endurance and vulnerability to mines posed risks, painting a vivid picture of early sub perils.  \n\nQ8: What is its historical legacy?  \nA8: The Mariotte represents pioneering French sub tech, inspiring future designs with its bold yet fleeting legacy."}

The wave's organization changed little until October 4 as it moved westward, when curved banding features began to increase. However, little improvement in the wave's organization occurred until October 6 after continuing to move westward for two days, when an area of low pressure was identified by the National Hurricane Center. Afterward, the cloudiness became more concentrated, and the system organized into a tropical depression by noon on October 6, shortly after the first advisory from the NHC was issued at 11 a.m. AST.\n\nLocated 620 mi (1,000 km) east-southeast of Barbados, the twelfth depression of the season moved just north of due west, steered quickly at 20 to 25 mph (40 km\/h) by a ridge of high pressure in the lower to middle troposphere. At 5 p.m. AST later on October 6, the NHC noted that the depression was nearing tropical storm strength. Shortly after, a burst of heavy convective thunderstorms developed over the ill-defined low-level center, and as organization improved, the system was upgraded to 40 mph (64 km\/h) Tropical Storm Jerry around midnight on October 7. Located within an environment of weak vertical wind shear, Jerry strengthened further, with its maximum sustained winds reaching their estimated peak of around 50 mph (80 km\/h) as Jerry approached the Windward Islands later on October 7. Jerry passed just south of Barbados at its peak intensity, followed by a slowing of forward speed and jog to the northwest as Jerry entered the Windward Islands early on October 8. Reconnaissance aircraft also indicated a possible reformation of the center, as data indicated multiple low-level rotations on a northeast to southwest axis.\n\nAs Jerry entered the eastern Caribbean Sea early on October 8 after bypassing St. Vincent, its forward speed increased to 25 mph (40 km\/h), and reconnaissance aircraft observations indicated a broad circulation with several small rotations but an ill-defined low-level center. Later, satellite observations indicated that the storm was poorly organized, with an elongated cloud mass and displaced secondary center to the northwest. Moderate vertical wind shear from the northwest developed, disrupting Jerry's upper-level outflow. Jerry continued to deteriorate, and later on October 8, aircraft data indicated the system had weakened into a broad area of low pressure with scattered squalls mainly to the east of the remnant center. Jerry then dissipated shortly afterward approximately 230 miles south of Puerto Rico, with the remnants moving westward.\n\n ## Preparations and impact\n\nDue to the tropical cyclone's short life, overall track errors in model guidance were not significant, and most models accurately indicated Jerry's westward to west-northwest course into the Caribbean Sea. Most models and official forecasts did not anticipate Jerry's dissipation, and numerous models indicated the system would reach hurricane status within two to three days under favorable conditions. Prior to Jerry's formation, a tropical storm watch was issued for Barbados at 5 p.m. EDT on October 6 because of forecasts that indicated the depression could intensify to tropical storm intensity. As the depression intensified to tropical storm status and moved closer to the Windward Islands, a tropical storm watch was issued for Tobago by the government of the island nation and for nearby Grenada by the Trinidad and Tobago Meteorological Service at 5 a.m. EDT on October 7. A tropical storm warning was issued for Barbados at 8 a.m. EDT.\n\nJerry caused minimal damage as it moved through the Windward Islands and Lesser Antilles. A station at Martinique reported sustained ten-minute winds of 44 mph (71 km\/h) on October 8. The outer bands of Jerry delivered light rainfall to Grenada on October 8, but no damage was reported.

The wave's organization changed little until October 4 as it moved westward, when curved banding features began to increase. However, little improvement in the wave's organization occurred until October 6 after continuing to move westward for two days, when an area of low pressure was identified by the National Hurricane Center. Afterward, the cloudiness became more concentrated, and the system organized into a tropical depression by noon on October 6, shortly after the first advisory from the NHC was issued at 11 a.m. AST.\n\nLocated 620 mi (1,000 km) east-southeast of Barbados, the twelfth depression of the season moved just north of due west, steered quickly at 20 to 25 mph (40 km\/h) by a ridge of high pressure in the lower to middle troposphere. At 5 p.m. AST later on October 6, the NHC noted that the depression was nearing tropical storm strength. Shortly after, a burst of heavy convective thunderstorms developed over the ill-defined low-level center, and as organization improved, the system was upgraded to 40 mph (64 km\/h) Tropical Storm Jerry around midnight on October 7. Located within an environment of weak vertical wind shear, Jerry strengthened further, with its maximum sustained winds reaching their estimated peak of around 50 mph (80 km\/h) as Jerry approached the Windward Islands later on October 7. Jerry passed just south of Barbados at its peak intensity, followed by a slowing of forward speed and jog to the northwest as Jerry entered the Windward Islands early on October 8. Reconnaissance aircraft also indicated a possible reformation of the center, as data indicated multiple low-level rotations on a northeast to southwest axis.\n\nAs Jerry entered the eastern Caribbean Sea early on October 8 after bypassing St. Vincent, its forward speed increased to 25 mph (40 km\/h), and reconnaissance aircraft observations indicated a broad circulation with several small rotations but an ill-defined low-level center. Later, satellite observations indicated that the storm was poorly organized, with an elongated cloud mass and displaced secondary center to the northwest. Moderate vertical wind shear from the northwest developed, disrupting Jerry's upper-level outflow. Jerry continued to deteriorate, and later on October 8, aircraft data indicated the system had weakened into a broad area of low pressure with scattered squalls mainly to the east of the remnant center. Jerry then dissipated shortly afterward approximately 230 miles south of Puerto Rico, with the remnants moving westward.\n\n ## Preparations and impact\n\nDue to the tropical cyclone's short life, overall track errors in model guidance were not significant, and most models accurately indicated Jerry's westward to west-northwest course into the Caribbean Sea. Most models and official forecasts did not anticipate Jerry's dissipation, and numerous models indicated the system would reach hurricane status within two to three days under favorable conditions. Prior to Jerry's formation, a tropical storm watch was issued for Barbados at 5 p.m. EDT on October 6 because of forecasts that indicated the depression could intensify to tropical storm intensity. As the depression intensified to tropical storm status and moved closer to the Windward Islands, a tropical storm watch was issued for Tobago by the government of the island nation and for nearby Grenada by the Trinidad and Tobago Meteorological Service at 5 a.m. EDT on October 7. A tropical storm warning was issued for Barbados at 8 a.m. EDT.\n\nJerry caused minimal damage as it moved through the Windward Islands and Lesser Antilles. A station at Martinique reported sustained ten-minute winds of 44 mph (71 km\/h) on October 8. The outer bands of Jerry delivered light rainfall to Grenada on October 8, but no damage was reported. Some downpours and high winds were reported. No ships reported tropical storm-force winds, though Barbados reported a minimum pressure of 1007 mb.","h_score":-1.0,"h_score_cat":0,"pageid":10410684,"revid":1171832894,"description":"Atlantic tropical storm in 2001","categories":["2001 Atlantic hurricane season","Atlantic tropical storms","Hurricanes in Barbados","Hurricanes in Martinique","Hurricanes in Saint Lucia","Hurricanes in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines","Hurricanes in the Windward Islands","Tropical cyclones in 2001"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade 7\n\n**Learning Objectives:**\n1.

David Fry, the club's reserve goalkeeper, replaced the injured Ron Hillyard for the Brentford game, and retained his place until late November. Gillingham defeated Reading on 23 October to record their first win for five games, and were moments away from beating Bradford City four days later but conceded a last-minute equaliser. The team's first match of November was away to York City and resulted in a 7\u20131 defeat; it was the first time Gillingham had conceded seven goals in a game since 1961. The poor run of results meant that the team had slipped to 11th out of 24 teams in the Third Division. Robinson scored his first goal for the club to secure a 1\u20130 win away to Burnley on 6 November, which would prove to be the first of four consecutive league victories. Shearer scored the winner in a 2\u20131 victory at home to Rotherham United and repeated the feat as Gillingham won by the same score away to Bolton Wanderers on 24 November, the first time Bolton had lost a Third Division match at home since August. Hillyard returned to the team against Bolton and made his 450th appearance for Gillingham. Shearer extended his run of scoring in consecutive league games with two goals in a 4\u20130 win at home to Preston North End on 1 December, which took Gillingham back up to third in the table. The team's winning run came to an end with a 2\u20130 defeat away to Lincoln City on 15 December; a week later Gillingham beat Doncaster Rovers 1\u20130 despite having to play more than half the game with only ten players after John Leslie had to be substituted and subsequently John Sharpe also went off injured. The team's final home match of 1984 was against Derby County on 26 December; the attendance of 7,140 was the highest of the season for a Third Division match at Priestfield Stadium. Gillingham won 3\u20132 despite having Mehmet sent off; the midfielder angrily pulled off his shirt and threw it at the referee as he walked off the pitch. Three days later the team beat Bristol Rovers 4\u20131, their seventh win in eight league games, and ended 1984 second in the table.","h_score":1174942.5125,"h_score_cat":0,"pageid":73228611,"revid":1158798580,"description":null,"categories":["1984\u201385 Football League Third Division by team","Gillingham F.C. seasons"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Gillingham F.C.'s Resilient 1984-85 Season\n\nThe 1984-85 campaign saw Gillingham F.C. battle through the Third Division with a mix of triumphs and setbacks, ultimately finishing mid-table.

It is first mentioned and described in Henry Piers' Chorographical Description of the County of Westmeath (written 1682, published 1770). Piers (1629\u20131691) was a MP, antiquarian and the owner of the land on which the abbey was located. Although recognising the object as a reliquary, Piers assumed it to have been a container for a small manuscript. When finally opened it was found to contain a block of wood, which is now presumed by archeologists to have been a substitute for a saint's hand-bell, and was presumably left in place to prevent the metal's inward collapse.\n\nThe shrine's cap and crest date to the 11th or 12th centuries; the crucifixion and other parts of the main face are 15th-century additions. Although its early medieval provenance is unknown, it is generally accepted that the early modern additions were completed at Tristernagh, where it was located when brought to the attention of Piers. Historians consider it probable that the priory invested in upgrading the shrine to redeem and re-establish itself after it faced charges of treason in 1468 \"for joining with Irish enemies and English rebels in raiding and burning the town of Taghmon and in destroying many of the king's loyal subjects\".\n\nLittle is known of its early modern provenance. It was probably held by hereditary keepers after the 1536 dissolution of the abbey. Piers received the shrine at Tristernagh from an unidentified man he described as \"a certain gentleman, a great zealot of the Romish Church\". Cautious not to damage the structure, he did not open the shrine (it was first opened in the late 19th century), but suspected that it contained \"a bible of the smaller volume\" (ie a \"pocket bible\" or pocket gospel book). He wrote that \"whether it have anything hidden within it, is known I believe to no man living, but it ... is held to this day in great veneration by all of the Romanish persuasion that live hereabout\". Piers recorded that the shrine had an on-going tradition of use for swearing oaths, and noted that it was held in reverence and was of such \"peculiar solemnity\" that any man who \"delivered falsehoods ... is sure to be visited in some dreadful manner\".\n\nThe Corp Naomh was first exhibited at the Irish Industrial Exhibition world's fair held in Cork in 1852, where it was shown alongside recently discovered Insular artworks such as the Cathach, Saint Manchan's Shrine and the Cross of Cong. It was acquired for \u00a321 by the Royal Irish Academy (RIA) from Messrs. Hodges Figgis & Co. of Grafton Street, Dublin, before it was bequeathed in 1887 to the National Museum of Ireland.\n\n ## Function\n\nHand-bells were primarily used in early Medieval Ireland to call monks to prayer, and over time those associated with a saint became insignia of clerical office. By 1100 the more important bells from the 600\u2013900 period were treated as relics, having the perceived ability to heal sickness, secure oaths or grant fortune. A few were preserved in the late 11th and early 12th centuries, during a period when the enshrinement of relics by the highest-ranking metalworkers was at its height. Like Cumdachs (book-shaped reliquaries) and house-shaped shrines, bell-shrines are essentially metal containers. Most embellished bell coverings, including the Corp Naomh, follow the general shape of a tubular hand-bell and are capped with a semicircular crest outlining the shape of a handle.\n\nThe \"Corp Naomh\" title is modern and translates from Irish as the \"sacred (or holy) body\". The wording is based on the large central figure of Jesus on the cross. At 23 cm (9.1 in) high, the shrine is around the size of a pocket bible and until the mid-19th century was assumed to be a container for a manuscript. Its shape and size fall within the archeologist Cormac Bourke's \"Class 1\" classification of hand-bells; that is bells produced between 600 and 900 of iron coated with bronze, largely in the west-midlands of Ireland.\n\n ## Description\n\nThe shrine is 23 cm (9.1 in) high and 12 cm (4.7 in) wide. It consists of a bronze sheet and cast metal protruding mounts attached to a slim wooden core. The semi-circular cap and crest at the top and the nielloed bronze cross on the main body of the reverse date from the 9th or 10th century. The stamped side-border panels are 15th-century, and the crucifixion and oval crystal on the front are possibly 16th-century.\n\n ### Cap and crest\n\nThe semicircular cap is 12 cm (4.7 in) high. It consists of a hollow bronze casting decorated front and back with human and animal figures, with an openwork crest running along its upper border. The front side contains a bearded cleric surrounded by horsemen and birds, and the reverse shows two confronted animals and foliate coils. Although the reverse was once as decorated as the front, it is now severely damaged and has significant losses.

His body reaches the full-length of the cap and the top is within the crest and the back of his head protrudes into the reverse. He is assumed to be an ecclesiastic based on his clothing, the fact he is holding a book, and that he is partially bald \u2013 a contemporary short-hand for indicating clerics or monks. Given his similarities to the figures on the 11th-century Soisc\u00e9l Molaisse reliquary, several scholars have suggested that he is one of the Four Evangelists. The figure is in low relief and poor condition: his face is badly worn and his lower body contains three large puncture holes from later rivets. The remaining discernable facial features include his mouth and nose, one eye, and his beard. He wears a full-length and according to Bourke a \"wing-like\" tunic or cloak rendered with cross hatching on enamel and niello, and an undergarment with similar borders at the lower hem. Raised diagonal bands divide the robe into four sections, between which are decorative panels containing incised (marked with cuts) herringbone, basket-weaved hatched and chevron patterns. His shoes have pointed toes, high tongues and elaborate ankles; a triquetra knot design is placed above each foot. The pattern between his legs was probably a ring-knot, but is now punctured by a rivet hole.\n\nHis shoulders have circular ornaments and cross hatchings resembling early versions of the Orthodox cross. The 19th-century historian William Frazer described these and their \"equal-rayed limbs\" as an examples of the then \"popular and universally worn\" Patrick's Cross type, which he said were \"distinctive emblems of Christian teaching ... [that were a] recognised badge of those who possessed rank in the Celtic churches\". Other early works containing similar designs include figures on a stone cross from Meigle, Scotland, and the 12th-century Irish Saint Manchan's Shrine. Above the circular ornaments are triangular shapes, possibly representing Celtic brooches.\n\n","h_score":1439804.7312500002,"h_score_cat":2,"pageid":70411031,"revid":1160321567,"description":"9th or 10th century Irish bell shrine","categories":["Bell-shrines","Collection of the National Museum of Ireland"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Corp Naomh?  \nA1: Corp Naomh is a vibrant community sports club in Ireland, focused on Gaelic football and fostering local spirit.\n\nQ2: When was it founded?  \nA2: Established in the early 2000s, it grew from a small parish group into a beloved fixture.\n\nQ3: What activities does it offer?  \nA3: It hosts matches, training sessions, and family events, blending competition with fun gatherings.\n\nQ4: Who can join?  \nA4: All ages and skill levels are welcome, from kids to adults, promoting inclusivity and teamwork.\n\nQ5: What are its achievements?  \nA5: The club has won local championships and nurtured talents, earning community pride and recognition.\n\nQ6: How does it contribute to the community?  \nA6: It builds bonds through events and charity drives, like spirited fundraisers that light up neighborhoods.\n\nQ7: What challenges does it face?  \nA7: Funding and field maintenance pose hurdles, yet the club's resilient members keep the game alive.\n\nQ8: What's next for Corp Naomh?  \nA8: Expansion plans include youth programs and partnerships, aiming to weave deeper into community fabric."}

It is first mentioned and described in Henry Piers' Chorographical Description of the County of Westmeath (written 1682, published 1770). Piers (1629\u20131691) was a MP, antiquarian and the owner of the land on which the abbey was located. Although recognising the object as a reliquary, Piers assumed it to have been a container for a small manuscript. When finally opened it was found to contain a block of wood, which is now presumed by archeologists to have been a substitute for a saint's hand-bell, and was presumably left in place to prevent the metal's inward collapse.\n\nThe shrine's cap and crest date to the 11th or 12th centuries; the crucifixion and other parts of the main face are 15th-century additions. Although its early medieval provenance is unknown, it is generally accepted that the early modern additions were completed at Tristernagh, where it was located when brought to the attention of Piers. Historians consider it probable that the priory invested in upgrading the shrine to redeem and re-establish itself after it faced charges of treason in 1468 \"for joining with Irish enemies and English rebels in raiding and burning the town of Taghmon and in destroying many of the king's loyal subjects\".\n\nLittle is known of its early modern provenance. It was probably held by hereditary keepers after the 1536 dissolution of the abbey. Piers received the shrine at Tristernagh from an unidentified man he described as \"a certain gentleman, a great zealot of the Romish Church\". Cautious not to damage the structure, he did not open the shrine (it was first opened in the late 19th century), but suspected that it contained \"a bible of the smaller volume\" (ie a \"pocket bible\" or pocket gospel book). He wrote that \"whether it have anything hidden within it, is known I believe to no man living, but it ... is held to this day in great veneration by all of the Romanish persuasion that live hereabout\". Piers recorded that the shrine had an on-going tradition of use for swearing oaths, and noted that it was held in reverence and was of such \"peculiar solemnity\" that any man who \"delivered falsehoods ... is sure to be visited in some dreadful manner\".\n\nThe Corp Naomh was first exhibited at the Irish Industrial Exhibition world's fair held in Cork in 1852, where it was shown alongside recently discovered Insular artworks such as the Cathach, Saint Manchan's Shrine and the Cross of Cong. It was acquired for \u00a321 by the Royal Irish Academy (RIA) from Messrs. Hodges Figgis & Co. of Grafton Street, Dublin, before it was bequeathed in 1887 to the National Museum of Ireland.\n\n ## Function\n\nHand-bells were primarily used in early Medieval Ireland to call monks to prayer, and over time those associated with a saint became insignia of clerical office. By 1100 the more important bells from the 600\u2013900 period were treated as relics, having the perceived ability to heal sickness, secure oaths or grant fortune. A few were preserved in the late 11th and early 12th centuries, during a period when the enshrinement of relics by the highest-ranking metalworkers was at its height. Like Cumdachs (book-shaped reliquaries) and house-shaped shrines, bell-shrines are essentially metal containers. Most embellished bell coverings, including the Corp Naomh, follow the general shape of a tubular hand-bell and are capped with a semicircular crest outlining the shape of a handle.\n\nThe \"Corp Naomh\" title is modern and translates from Irish as the \"sacred (or holy) body\". The wording is based on the large central figure of Jesus on the cross. At 23 cm (9.1 in) high, the shrine is around the size of a pocket bible and until the mid-19th century was assumed to be a container for a manuscript. Its shape and size fall within the archeologist Cormac Bourke's \"Class 1\" classification of hand-bells; that is bells produced between 600 and 900 of iron coated with bronze, largely in the west-midlands of Ireland.\n\n ## Description\n\nThe shrine is 23 cm (9.1 in) high and 12 cm (4.7 in) wide. It consists of a bronze sheet and cast metal protruding mounts attached to a slim wooden core. The semi-circular cap and crest at the top and the nielloed bronze cross on the main body of the reverse date from the 9th or 10th century. The stamped side-border panels are 15th-century, and the crucifixion and oval crystal on the front are possibly 16th-century.\n\n ### Cap and crest\n\nThe semicircular cap is 12 cm (4.7 in) high. It consists of a hollow bronze casting decorated front and back with human and animal figures, with an openwork crest running along its upper border. The front side contains a bearded cleric surrounded by horsemen and birds, and the reverse shows two confronted animals and foliate coils. Although the reverse was once as decorated as the front, it is now severely damaged and has significant losses. The shape of the reverse echoes that of the front, but contains an extra border between the crest and figurative panels, composed of hatched bands. It contains a series of much thinner confronted animals with hind legs extending forwards. The crest is of bronze and decorated on both sides with three-loop running-knot interlace patterns in openwork and lined at the top with a plain-ridge upper-border.\n\n","h_score":1439804.7312500002,"h_score_cat":2,"pageid":70411031,"revid":1160321567,"description":"9th or 10th century Irish bell shrine","categories":["Bell-shrines","Collection of the National Museum of Ireland"],"task":"INTERVIEW","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Q1: What is Corp Naomh?  \nA1: Corp Naomh is a spirited community corps, like a flock of mischievous saints, dedicated to weaving kindness into everyday life.\n\nQ2: When was it founded?  \nA2: Born in 2015 from a spark of Irish inspiration, it rallied locals to tackle loneliness with colorful events.\n\nQ3: Who can join?  \nA3: Anyone with a heartbeat and a grin\u2014open to all ages, as long as you're ready for playful service adventures.\n\nQ4: What activities does it run?  \nA4: From street cleanups with shamrock vibes to storytelling sessions, they blend fun and purpose in unexpected ways.\n\nQ5: How does it impact the community?  \nA5: It fosters bonds like secret handshakes, boosting morale and sparking joy in overlooked corners.\n\nQ6: What challenges does it face?  \nA6: Funding woes hit like sneaky goblins, but they dodge with creative twists and community backup.\n\nQ7: What are its future plans?  \nA7: Expanding to digital realms, they'll launch virtual saintly quests for global unity and fresh mischief.\n\nQ8: How can someone get involved?  \nA8: Swing by their lively gatherings or sign up online\u2014your quirky energy is the key to joining the fun."}

It is first mentioned and described in Henry Piers' Chorographical Description of the County of Westmeath (written 1682, published 1770). Piers (1629\u20131691) was a MP, antiquarian and the owner of the land on which the abbey was located. Although recognising the object as a reliquary, Piers assumed it to have been a container for a small manuscript. When finally opened it was found to contain a block of wood, which is now presumed by archeologists to have been a substitute for a saint's hand-bell, and was presumably left in place to prevent the metal's inward collapse.\n\nThe shrine's cap and crest date to the 11th or 12th centuries; the crucifixion and other parts of the main face are 15th-century additions. Although its early medieval provenance is unknown, it is generally accepted that the early modern additions were completed at Tristernagh, where it was located when brought to the attention of Piers. Historians consider it probable that the priory invested in upgrading the shrine to redeem and re-establish itself after it faced charges of treason in 1468 \"for joining with Irish enemies and English rebels in raiding and burning the town of Taghmon and in destroying many of the king's loyal subjects\".\n\nLittle is known of its early modern provenance. It was probably held by hereditary keepers after the 1536 dissolution of the abbey. Piers received the shrine at Tristernagh from an unidentified man he described as \"a certain gentleman, a great zealot of the Romish Church\". Cautious not to damage the structure, he did not open the shrine (it was first opened in the late 19th century), but suspected that it contained \"a bible of the smaller volume\" (ie a \"pocket bible\" or pocket gospel book). He wrote that \"whether it have anything hidden within it, is known I believe to no man living, but it ... is held to this day in great veneration by all of the Romanish persuasion that live hereabout\". Piers recorded that the shrine had an on-going tradition of use for swearing oaths, and noted that it was held in reverence and was of such \"peculiar solemnity\" that any man who \"delivered falsehoods ... is sure to be visited in some dreadful manner\".\n\nThe Corp Naomh was first exhibited at the Irish Industrial Exhibition world's fair held in Cork in 1852, where it was shown alongside recently discovered Insular artworks such as the Cathach, Saint Manchan's Shrine and the Cross of Cong. It was acquired for \u00a321 by the Royal Irish Academy (RIA) from Messrs. Hodges Figgis & Co. of Grafton Street, Dublin, before it was bequeathed in 1887 to the National Museum of Ireland.\n\n ## Function\n\nHand-bells were primarily used in early Medieval Ireland to call monks to prayer, and over time those associated with a saint became insignia of clerical office. By 1100 the more important bells from the 600\u2013900 period were treated as relics, having the perceived ability to heal sickness, secure oaths or grant fortune. A few were preserved in the late 11th and early 12th centuries, during a period when the enshrinement of relics by the highest-ranking metalworkers was at its height. Like Cumdachs (book-shaped reliquaries) and house-shaped shrines, bell-shrines are essentially metal containers. Most embellished bell coverings, including the Corp Naomh, follow the general shape of a tubular hand-bell and are capped with a semicircular crest outlining the shape of a handle.\n\nThe \"Corp Naomh\" title is modern and translates from Irish as the \"sacred (or holy) body\". The wording is based on the large central figure of Jesus on the cross. At 23 cm (9.1 in) high, the shrine is around the size of a pocket bible and until the mid-19th century was assumed to be a container for a manuscript. Its shape and size fall within the archeologist Cormac Bourke's \"Class 1\" classification of hand-bells; that is bells produced between 600 and 900 of iron coated with bronze, largely in the west-midlands of Ireland.\n\n ## Description\n\nThe shrine is 23 cm (9.1 in) high and 12 cm (4.7 in) wide. It consists of a bronze sheet and cast metal protruding mounts attached to a slim wooden core. The semi-circular cap and crest at the top and the nielloed bronze cross on the main body of the reverse date from the 9th or 10th century. The stamped side-border panels are 15th-century, and the crucifixion and oval crystal on the front are possibly 16th-century.\n\n ### Cap and crest\n\nThe semicircular cap is 12 cm (4.7 in) high. It consists of a hollow bronze casting decorated front and back with human and animal figures, with an openwork crest running along its upper border. The front side contains a bearded cleric surrounded by horsemen and birds, and the reverse shows two confronted animals and foliate coils. Although the reverse was once as decorated as the front, it is now severely damaged and has significant losses. The shape of the reverse echoes that of the front, but contains an extra border between the crest and figurative panels, composed of hatched bands. It contains a series of much thinner confronted animals with hind legs extending forwards. The crest is of bronze and decorated on both sides with three-loop running-knot interlace patterns in openwork and lined at the top with a plain-ridge upper-border.\n\n","h_score":1439804.7312500002,"h_score_cat":2,"pageid":70411031,"revid":1160321567,"description":"9th or 10th century Irish bell shrine","categories":["Bell-shrines","Collection of the National Museum of Ireland"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### Corp Naomh: Saints of Innovation Emerge\n\nIn a whirlwind debut, Corp Naomh, an Irish-rooted tech firm, champions ethical AI with tools that blend morality and machinery like digital halos.

The shrine was rediscovered sometime before 1682 at Tristernagh Abbey, near Templecross, County Westmeath. The shrine is 23 cm (9.1 in) high and 12 cm (4.7 in) wide. It was heavily refurbished and added to during a second phase of embellishment in the 15th century, and now consists of cast and sheet bronze plates mounted on a wooden core decorated with silver, niello and rock crystal. It is severely damaged with extensive losses and wear across almost all of its parts, and when discovered a block of wood had been substituted for the bell itself. The remaining elements are considered of high historical and artistic value by archeologists and art historians.\n\nSections from its original, early Medieval phase include the cross on the reverse and the ornate semi-circular cap, which shows a bearded cleric holding a book. He is surrounded by horsemen above whom are large birds seemingly about to take flight. It was extensively refurbished in the 15th (and possibly 16th) centuries when the central bronze crucifix, the griffin and lion panel, the stamped border panels and the backing plate were added. The badly damaged crucifix and large enamel stud on the front date from at least the 15th century.\n\nThe shrine's medieval provenance is incomplete. It was probably held by hereditary keepers after the dissolution of Tristernagh Abbey in 1536 until it passed into the possession of the Anglo-Irish owners of the site.

When Dwight is dejectedly listening to music in his car, he is playing \"Everybody Hurts\" by R.E.M. Dwight and Michael's \"Ryan Started the Fire\" is a thinly veiled song parody of the Billy Joel song \"We Didn't Start the Fire\".\n\nDuring the game of desert island, many of the employees reference specific films and books. Angela says she would take The Bible, A Purpose Driven Life, and The Da Vinci Code, but only to burn the latter. Dwight notes that he would take the Physicians' Desk Reference, but hollow it out and fill it with supplies; he also states he would bring Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone or Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban in case he got bored. Meredith later reveals that she would bring Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blonde, The Bridges of Madison County, and \"just the pottery scene\" from Ghost to watch. Pam picks Fargo, Edward Scissorhands, Dazed and Confused, The Breakfast Club, and The Princess Bride. After asking what Dwight would bring, he says The Crow.\n\n","h_score":1466549.3687500001,"h_score_cat":2,"pageid":4087244,"revid":1155107465,"description":null,"categories":["2005 American television episodes","Fiction about fire","The Office (American season 2) episodes"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"HYBRID","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 9\n\nLearning Objectives:\n1.

Written by B. J. Novak and directed by Ken Kwapis, the episode first aired in the United States on October 11, 2005, on NBC. The episode features Amy Adams as Jim's girlfriend, Katy.\n\nThe series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) takes it upon himself to teach Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) about business, but soon everyone is forced to evacuate the office due to a fire. While outside, Michael continues to show an interest in Ryan, causing Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to be jealous. Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) organizes games to play outside.\n\nAccording to B. J. Novak, the episode was \"a fun one to film\". Although the cast and crew appear to be cold in the finished episode, \"The Fire\" was filmed in 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) weather; thus, the actors \"couldn't look hot\" and had to pretend to shiver. The firemen in the scene were played by actual firemen, and their costumes were designed in order to look like authentic Scranton firefighters.\n\n ## Plot\n\nPam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) learns that Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Katy Moore (Amy Adams) have started dating. Michael Scott (Steve Carell) gives Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) a glowing checkpoint review. When Ryan expresses his interest in starting his own business someday, Michael takes it upon himself to teach Ryan the \"ten rules of business\". The fire alarm sounds, and while Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) both attempt to take charge of the evacuation, Michael pushes others out of the way in his escape out of the building.\n\nThe employees play games to pass the time, including \"Desert Island Picks\" and \"Who Would You Do?\" When Ryan reveals that he is attending business school at night, Michael becomes enamored of his newfound prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Dwight becomes noticeably jealous of Ryan's favor with Michael, and he is seen sulking in his car to the tune \"Everybody Hurts\" by R.E.M. When Michael mentions that he left his cell phone in the office, Dwight rushes back into the building to fetch it.\n\nMichael asks Ryan to call his cell phone to help Dwight find it. The phone rings, which happens to be in Michael's pocket. Dwight emerges, coughing, from the building and reveals that the fire was started by Ryan, who left a cheese pita in the toaster-oven set to \"oven\" instead of \"toaster\". Dwight and Michael mock Ryan and dub him \"The Fire Guy\" by doing a song parody of the Billy Joel song \"We Didn't Start the Fire\".\n\n","h_score":1466549.3687500001,"h_score_cat":2,"pageid":4087244,"revid":1155107465,"description":null,"categories":["2005 American television episodes","Fiction about fire","The Office (American season 2) episodes"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade 11\n\n**Learning Objectives:**\n1.

Its aim was to record for posterity what day-to-day life was like in the UK during 2006. British people were invited to write a blog of what they did on 17 October 2006, and to submit it to become a part of a large online diary. The project was open to all UK citizens and individuals of British origin, and was inspired by Mass Observation, a similar social research project founded in 1937. The date was chosen to be 17 October by History Matters in the hope that it would be \"an ordinary day much like any other of no particular national significance\", and would therefore reflect the everyday life of its participants. Historian Dan Snow explained that the project was intended to be \"a detailed account of people's normal lives when they're doing nothing out of the ordinary. ...

He was also critical of History Matters in general, saying that he had \"no idea how history [was] going to impact on [him]\".

This approach highlights both major occurrences and daily life. It makes history more relatable and detailed.\n\nQ2: Why is it important?\nA2: It provides in-depth insights into specific moments. This helps connect broad historical trends to personal experiences. It encourages deeper engagement with the past.\n\nQ3: Can you give an example?\nA3: One example is D-Day on June 6, 1944. It involved massive invasions and individual stories. This day shaped World War II outcomes.\n\nQ4: How does it differ from general history?\nA4: General history covers wide periods, while this focuses on one day. It offers granular details that broader studies often miss. This method humanizes events.\n\nQ5: Who uses this approach?\nA5: Historians, educators, and writers often use it. It's popular in books and documentaries. It aids in teaching and public understanding.\n\nQ6: What are the benefits?\nA6: It reveals overlooked aspects of life. It fosters empathy for historical figures. This can inspire further research.\n\nQ7: Are there limitations?\nA7: It might ignore long-term patterns. It requires specific sources to be effective. Still, it complements other methods.\n\nQ8: How can someone learn more?\nA8: Read books on key historical days. Watch related documentaries or visit museums. Join community history discussions for insights."}

Its aim was to record for posterity what day-to-day life was like in the UK during 2006. British people were invited to write a blog of what they did on 17 October 2006, and to submit it to become a part of a large online diary. The project was open to all UK citizens and individuals of British origin, and was inspired by Mass Observation, a similar social research project founded in 1937. The date was chosen to be 17 October by History Matters in the hope that it would be \"an ordinary day much like any other of no particular national significance\", and would therefore reflect the everyday life of its participants. Historian Dan Snow explained that the project was intended to be \"a detailed account of people's normal lives when they're doing nothing out of the ordinary. ... It's those mundane details, those boring details that will seem extraordinary to people hundreds of years in the future.\" The organisers hoped that the contributors could also discuss the impact of history or heritage on their lives that day in their submissions.\n\nEach entry was limited to a length of 100\u2013650 words. To allow some time for drafting and proofreading, participants were allowed to upload their diary entries until the end of the month. Schoolchildren were encouraged to take part, with all 29,000 UK schools being invited to participate. On the day itself, the homepages of the 2,000 computers in the easyCafe network were all set to the History Matters website, and several celebrities and public figures also voiced their support of the initiative, including Stephen Fry, Bob Geldof and Tony Robinson.\n\n ### Public response\n\nBy the afternoon of 17 October, the One Day in History website had received more than 5,000 submissions, at a rate of three per second, and by 1800 BST (1700 GMT) this number grew to 8,000. Within three days, 41,250 blogs were posted to the site, and by 1 November, a final total of 46,000 submissions were received. The entries were briefly displayed on the History Matters website, before being archived in both the UK Web Archive at the British Library and in the library of the University of Sussex. The National Trust described the project and its response from the public as \"hugely successful\".\n\n ### Media response\n\nDavid Cannadine of the Institute of Historical Research spoke positively of One Day in History, remarking: \"The wonderful thing about these records is we don't yet know what it is about them that will be interesting in the future.\" In promotion of the project, Fiona Reynolds, the Director-General of the National Trust, stated: \"We want this day to have its own place in history and be a snapshot of everyday life at the beginning of the 21st century.\" Journalist John Plunkett expressed scepticism of this aim, writing in The Guardian that, despite the intentions of the campaign, it was only going to be \"a historical record of people with computers\". He was also critical of History Matters in general, saying that he had \"no idea how history [was] going to impact on [him]\". Dave Hill, also writing for The Guardian, described the campaign as a \"brilliant idea\". Following the publication of the diary entries, Robert Booth, a journalist for The Sunday Times, remarked that the \"monotony of most of [the British public's] lives was all too painfully obvious.\"","h_score":1401617.1687500002,"h_score_cat":1,"pageid":36824866,"revid":1118345622,"description":"UK heritage initiative","categories":["2006 in the United Kingdom","British Library","National Trust"],"task":"NEWS_ARTICLE","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"### One Giant Leap: A Day That Changed the Cosmos\n\nOn July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong's moonwalk symbolized humanity's triumph over gravity.

Several bridges in the Hampton Roads area were closed due to the hurricane. The strong storm surge surpassed the floodgate to the Midtown Tunnel while workers attempted to close the gate. About 44 million US gallons (170,000 m<sup>3<\/sup>) of water from the Elizabeth River flooded the tunnel entirely in just 40 minutes, with the workers barely able to escape. The flooding left the tunnel damaged and closed for nearly a month. Heavy rainfall led to moderate to severe inland flooding, with high waters reported along U.S. Route 460 in Prince George County, U.S. Route 17, and several other roads. The rainfall led to river flooding, including minor to moderate flooding along the Rivanna and James Rivers, moderate flooding along the Appomattox River, and moderate to major flooding along the Meherrin, Nottoway, and Blackwater Rivers. In Isle of Wight County, a driver attempted to cross high water on the James River Bridge and was killed when the water washed the car off of the road. The unusually large wind field uprooted many thousands of trees, downed many power lines, damaged hundreds of houses, and snapped thousands of telephone poles and cross arms. Hundreds of roads, including major highways, were blocked by fallen trees. An emergency evacuation shelter in Newport News reported minor wind damage. Two people in the region died due to falling trees\u2014one in New Kent County and one in the city of Hopewell. Power outages left most traffic lights not working across Hampton Roads, resulting in multiple minor car accidents.

It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 265 km\/h (165 mph) on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 165 km\/h (103 mph) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land as it passed through central Virginia, and Isabel became extratropical over western Pennsylvania on September 19.\n\nStrong winds from the hurricane affected 99 counties and cities in the state, which downed thousands of trees and left about 1.8 million without power. The storm surge impacted much of the southeastern portion of the state, peaking at around 9 feet (2.7 m) in Richmond along the James River; the surge caused significant damage to homes along riverways. The nationwide maximum rainfall total from the hurricane was 20.2 inches (510 mm) in Sherando, Virginia. In the state's mountainous region, heavy rainfall caused severe and damaging flash flooding.

The storm surge tracked into the central portion of the state, with a site on the James River in Richmond reporting an estimated surge of about 9 feet (2.7 m), about 103 river miles (166 km) from its confluence with the lower Chesapeake Bay. Additionally, widespread areas of heavy rainfall of over 5 inches (130 mm) led to flooding of rivers. Richmond set a new daily rainfall record from the precipitation from Isabel. Strong winds were reported throughout the region, and wind gusts reached 73 mph (117 km\/h) at Richmond International Airport.\n\nThe storm surge significantly damaged or destroyed many homes along the James River, particularly in the towns of Claremont and Burwells Bay, Virginia. The surges in several tidal rivers caught some residents by surprise, both in height and severity. A man in Henrico County drowned after crashing into a flooded creek.\n\nThe winds downed trees throughout the area, some of which hit homes and vehicles. In Amelia County, strong winds removed a mobile home from its foundation and destroyed it. Falling trees killed two in the area\u2014one in Chesterfield County and one in the city of Richmond. The downed trees snapped many power lines, leaving about 365,000 Dominion Virginia Power customers in the Richmond area without power. A portion of the roof of The Diamond, home of the Richmond Braves, was damaged by the winds.\n\nWet conditions caused many accidents along roadways in central Virginia. A motorist on Interstate 95 in Richmond died when he hydroplaned and crashed his car. In Albemarle County, a popular forest boardwalk that was part of the Monticello property was destroyed by a falling oak tree. Also in Albemarle, two people were killed when their car drove off a road and crashed into a tree during heavy rainfall. A man in Chesterfield County died when struck by a tree. Three people died when a car in southern Fluvanna County crashed into a tree. The deaths were considered indirectly related to the storm.\n\nIn south-central Virginia, strong winds produced widespread wind damage, with numerous trees and power lines reported down. In Campbell County, two homes were destroyed and ten others suffered minor damage. One residence in Amherst County suffered minor damage, and in Appomattox County one home reported major damage. In Buckingham County, one home was destroyed, three reported major damage, and one business suffered minor damage, while in Charlotte County, two homes were destroyed, 30 homes suffered major damage, and five businesses suffered minor damage. The storm destroyed one home and damaged 20, severely damaged three businesses, and caused some crop damage in Pittsylvania County.

The length of the evacuation process varied between a few hours to two days, with the worst evacuation problems being closed or flooded roads. The Virginia Army National Guard and State Police troopers assisted in the evacuations. In all, more than 160,000 residents in southeastern Virginia were told to evacuate, including 11,000 in vulnerable locations along the Chesapeake Bay and all residents in mobile home parks in Chesapeake and Newport News. A total of about 16,325 people evacuated to 67 shelters. Some of the reported problems were shortages of supplies, unanticipated medical issues, overcrowding, and lack of security. United States Navy officials in Norfolk ordered more than 40 destroyers, frigates, and amphibious ships out to sea to avoid any potential damage from the hurricane. Officials at the Langley Air Force Base in Hampton ordered about 6,000 workers to evacuate elsewhere, due to its vulnerability to flooding. About 350 National Guard workers assisted boat owners in the southeastern portion of the state. In Mathews County, two boat owners experienced fatal heart attacks as they worked to protect their boats. Officials distributed sandbags throughout the state for residents in flood-prone areas, including about 10,000 in the city of Alexandria. Prior to the arrival of the hurricane, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel was closed, as were all campgrounds along the Blue Ridge Parkway and the primary parkway in Roanoke. In Chincoteague, the famous Chincoteague Ponies were moved by volunteer firefighters to grounds of about 20 feet (6.1 m) higher. Officials closed schools, government offices, and businesses across the eastern portion of the state, leaving usually heavily congested roads as empty streets. Additionally, officials canceled trains along the Washington Metro, the Virginia Railway Express, and Amtrak lines, and several flights in and out of the Richmond International Airport. ## Impact\n\nThroughout the state, Hurricane Isabel resulted in a damage total of \\$1.85 billion (2003 USD, \\$2.17 billion 2008 USD). The hurricane destroyed more than 1,186 homes and 77 businesses, severely damaged 9,110 homes and 333 businesses, and left 107,908 homes and over 1,000 businesses with minor damage. Across the state, the hurricane generated an estimated 660,000 dump trucks of debris. At least ten people were directly killed by the storm, and hundreds more were injured. A total of 1.8 million electrical customers were left without power, with electrical damage totaling \\$128 million (2003 USD, \\$150 million 2008 USD). Dominion Virginia Power reported 2,311 broken utility poles, 3,899 snapped crossarms, and 7,363 spans of downed power lines, with 72% of its primary distribution circuits damaged.

Higher unofficial gusts were recorded, including a peak reading of 71 mph (114 km\/h) in Chincoteague. Rainfall was fairly light, with 2 inches (51 mm) recorded in Heathsville. On Fisherman Island, the hurricane produced a 4.26-foot (1.3-m) storm surge, flooding much of the island. The combination of the surge and waves resulted in minor beach erosion and overwash. Northampton County reported \\$10 million in crop damage (2003 USD, \\$12 million 2008 USD). One person died in Accomack County when a tree fell on his mobile home. In the Hampton Roads region, Isabel produced a high storm surge, including reports of 7.5 feet (2.3 m) at the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel and a peak of 8.3 feet (2.5 m) at Gloucester Point. Unofficially higher amounts included an estimate of 10.75 feet (3.28 m) at Smithfield. In some locations, the surge surpassed the previous record set by the 1933 Chesapeake-Potomac Hurricane. Despite being classified as a hurricane while crossing the state, sustained winds only peaked at 70 mph (110 km\/h) at Gloucester Point, 4 mph (6.4 km\/h) less than minimum hurricane intensity. Hurricane-force wind gusts were recorded at multiple locations, with a 91 mph (146 km\/h) reading at Gloucester Point and unofficial reports peaking at 107 mph (172 km\/h) on Gwynn's Island. Additionally, Chesapeake Light, located 12 miles (19 km) east of Virginia Beach, reported a peak wind gust of 107 mph (172 km\/h). The hurricane produced heavy rainfall in the Hampton Roads area, reaching 10.6 inches (270 mm) at James City. The outer rainbands of Isabel spawned a 150-foot (46 m) wide F0 tornado in Nottoway County near Crewe, the only confirmed tornado during the passage of the hurricane. However, many people in the city of Norfolk reported that there was a tornado in that city as well. The tornado lasted a short amount of time and caused no known damage. Strong waves, which reached 20 feet (6.1 m) in height offshore, caused severe beach erosion in Hampton, Newport News, and other locations along the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay. In Virginia Beach, the 15th Street fishing pier was significantly damaged due to intense wave action. Likewise the historic Harrison's Pier in the Ocean View area of Norfolk was completely destroyed. Many private piers and some public ones along the coastline were destroyed or damaged from the waves and storm surge, including a destroyed pier each in Buckroe Beach and Lynnhaven.

Stephen \"Koz\" Kozmeniuk produced six tracks on Lipa's debut album, including \"Thinking 'Bout You\". Koz played the drums, bass and synthesizer in the production, while Argyle played the guitar. Engineering was done by Cameron Gower Poole, assisted by Olly Thompson. The song was recorded at Modulator Music in Canada and the vocals were recorded at Sarm Music Village in London. Mixing and mastering were both handled by Matty Green at BabelFish Studios.\n\nMusically, \"Thinking 'Bout You\" is an acoustic R&B and retro-soul ballad that runs for two minutes and 51 seconds. The song is composed in the time signature of time and the key of E minor, with an acoustic groove tempo of 94 beats per minute and a chord progression of Cmaj7\u2013Bm7\u2013Am7\u2013Bm7\u2013E5. It follows a structure of verse, chorus, verse, chorus, middle eight, chorus. The song is driven by a plucked acoustic guitar and features a stripped-back production, with simple beats and an acoustic melody. Lipa uses impassioned, raspy and bluesy vocals that range from E<sub>3<\/sub> to D<sub>5<\/sub>. Lyrically, the song is a lovelorn lament that paints a picture of loss. Lipa attempts to forget about a past romance while evoking desperation in her tone, however, the memories keep haunting her. She admits that she used weed, alcohol and work as emotional stents.\n\n","h_score":1365053.25,"h_score_cat":1,"pageid":52800789,"revid":1170366801,"description":"2017 song by Dua Lipa","categories":["2010s ballads","2017 songs","British soul songs","Contemporary R&B ballads","Dua Lipa songs","Songs written by Adam Argyle","Songs written by Dua Lipa","Soul ballads"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 8\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.

In 2013, bassist Zach Bines and drummer Spencer Cole joined the project and started recording their self-titled debut EP immediately after. \"Motorcycle\", \"Take A Dip\", \"Do You See Past\" and \"Hulahoop\" were produced by Waters in his bedroom using Garageband, while \"Buttercup\" and \"Closer\" was produced by David Newfeld in his church studio of Dobbstown North. Waters described Newfeld's production contributions as \"music lessons and artist lessons in a way,\" given that he knew what he was making. He also said, \"That open mindedness and visibility to capture what happens in the moment and allow mistakes and encourage them brings you out of your comfort zone.\"\n\nThe indie pop album combines elements of high-quality recording common in pop music with lo-fi noise music styles, leading to a complicated sound of \"bombast and confusion\" and a feel of the tracks being \"disgusting\" yet \"catchy\" as the band described. Now's Carla Gillis gave style descriptions such as \"soul-grunge\" and \"sludge-pop\" to label this sound. Elements from a big number of genres are present on Weaves, such as neo-pop, R&B, soul, art rock, and psychedelic music. The lyrics on the songs are filled with sexual innuendo such as \"Won't you ride my motorcycle \/ Take a ride\", which Gillis wrote \"can turn into both amusing nah-nah-nah insolence and wailing, dead-serious desperation on a dime.\"\n\n","h_score":1207966.0875000001,"h_score_cat":0,"pageid":51022466,"revid":1116042694,"description":null,"categories":["2014 debut EPs","Indie pop EPs","Weaves (band) albums"],"task":"LESSON_PLAN","creativity_level":"VERY_CREATIVE","length_words":50,"blueprint":{},"quality_checks":{"mentions_wikipedia":false,"has_measurable_constraints":true,"includes_subject":true,"natural_sounding":true},"generation":"Grade Level: 4\n\nLearning Objectives:  \n1.
