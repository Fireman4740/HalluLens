He moves in with his friend and colleague Deven, and plans to return to India on the night of 31 December to start afresh.\n\nAkash attends the bank settlement and reconciles with several friends with whom he had fallen out, including his best friend Gaurav, as well as with his estranged father. Meanwhile, Kiara cannot stop thinking about Akash, and on the 31st she realises that she has fallen for him. Kunal discovers this and drops Kiara off at the airport. She reaches the bridge, but finds herself alone, believing she will never see Akash again. Just then he arrives. The pair go out to sea to die. Akash throws a beer bottle with a note in it, which Kiara gets and reads before he proposes to her. Surprised, she accepts, and the couple share a kiss while the Coast Guard rescues them.

He has admitted to Nancy that he is in love with both her and Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks), but she cannot cope with what Jack has told her. The two talk the situation over, and Jack eventually tells Nancy that he cares for her and decides he wants to be with her. After Floyd's wedding, Liz goes to the office of her fiancé, Wesley Snipes (Michael Sheen), to retrieve his shoes for Cerie Xerox's (Katrina Bowden) wedding. At Wesley's office, she meets an airline pilot named Carol (Matt Damon). When she learns that Carol is a big fan of The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS), for which Liz is the head writer, she asks Carol to go with her to Cerie's wedding, which he accepts. At Cerie's wedding, Wesley is distraught that Liz ended their engagement through a text message she sent to him. Liz tells him that fate brought them together so that she would meet Carol, with whom she can see herself spending the rest of her life. Wesley is devastated and leaves. Unbeknownst to Liz, Carol, who Liz thought had stepped out from the party area, heard everything she told Wesley, which shocks Carol, prompting him to leave. At the same time, at Cerie's wedding, Nancy learns that Avery is pregnant after having a conversation with her in the ladies room, and tells Jack before she leaves him. When Jack finds Avery, he tells her he wants to marry her, which she accepts.

This rarely encountered shark swims close to the bottom of the seafloor, typically at depths of 400–900 m (1,300–3,000 ft), though it may enter much shallower water. The bramble shark has a stout body with two small dorsal fins positioned far back and no anal fin. It can be readily identified by the large, thorn-like dermal denticles scattered over its body, some of which may be fused together. It is purplish brown or black in color and grows up to 3.1 m (10 ft) long.\n\nThe diet of the bramble shark includes smaller sharks, bony fishes, and crabs, which this slow-moving species may capture via suction. It is aplacental viviparous, with females producing litters of 15–52 pups. Harmless to humans, it is an occasional bycatch of commercial and recreational fishers, and may be used for fishmeal and liver oil. Its population has declined substantially in the northeastern Atlantic since the 18th and 19th centuries, likely because of overfishing.\n\n ## Taxonomy\n\nThe original description of the bramble shark was authored by French naturalist Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre in the 1788 Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique des trois regnes de la nature. He named it Squalus brucus, from the Greek brux or bruchios meaning \"from the depths of the sea\". The type specimen has since been lost. In 1816, Henri de Blainville created the genus Echinorhinus for this species. Until the 1960s, specimens of the prickly shark (E. cookei) caught in the Pacific Ocean were misidentified as bramble sharks. Other common names for this species are spinous shark and spiny shark.\n\n", "h_score": 1635290.875, "h_score_cat": 5, "pageid": 2964418, "revid": 1168691176, "description": "Species of shark", "categories": ["Echinorhinidae", "Fauna of Kiribati", "Fauna of South India", "Fish described in 1788", "Fish of Europe", "Fish of Japan", "Fish of the Atlantic Ocean", "Fish of the Mediterranean Sea", "Gulf of Oman", "Marine fish of New Zealand", "Marine fish of Southern Africa", "Marine fish of Southern Australia", "Taxa named by Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre"], "task": "PRESS_RELEASE", "creativity_level": "HYBRID", "length_words": 100, "blueprint": {"scenario_hook": "A marine research team in the Pacific is planning a study on bramble sharks' feeding habits and wants to use remote sensing techniques.", "audience": "marine scientists", "intent": "to gather data on feeding behavior of bramble sharks using remote sensors.", "constraints_soft": ["minimal invasive methods", "ethical compliance", "focus on deep water depths", "include historical population trends"], "seed_topics": ["deep-water habitats", "feeding mechanisms", "suction capture", "population decline", "remote sensing"], "tone_hints": ["informative", "concise"]}, "quality_checks": {"mentions_wikipedia": false, "has_measurable_constraints": true, "includes_subject": true, "natural_sounding": true}}

At 29 years old, Johnson signed on with the Homestead Grays as a player manager. During the season, Johnson directed his attention to Crawford Colored Giants catcher Josh Gibson who was mentioned in several newspapers for his ability to hit long home runs. The Grays, however, did not seriously pursue Gibson—the team already had two catchers, Buck Ewing and Vic Harris, on its roster. On July 25, 1930, the Grays played an exhibition game with the Monarchs; scheduled at night, the field was illuminated by Monarchs owner J. L. Wilkinson's portable lighting system to attract fans. Ewing, the starting catcher, lost sight of the ball in the low visibility and was injured by a pitch as Harris was playing in the outfield. In attendance, Gibson was called from the stands by Johnson to catch for the remainder of the game. He finished the season with the Grays; Johnson, his mentor, used him to catch batting practice everyday and gradually worked him into the line-up. Johnson spent the 1931 and early 1932 seasons managing the Daisies which joined the East–West League for the latter year. Although he was in the twilight of his playing career, Johnson still felt he could contribute to a winning team and signed on with the Pittsburgh Crawfords in 1932. The 1932 Crawfords team is considered one of the greatest squads ever assembled, often receiving comparisons to the New York Yankees' 1927 team known as the Murderers' Row. Their owner, the wealthy businessman Gus Greenlee, had little experience with baseball when he purchased the Crawfords in 1930 but was determined to aggressively purchase and trade for the best available players. By 1932, Greenlee signed five future hall of famers: Johnson, Cool Papa Bell, Josh Gibson, Satchel Paige, and Oscar Charleston, the player manager. Like Charleston, Johnson remained productive in the latter stage of his career, hitting well above a .300 BA during his five-year stint with the Crawfords. In 1935, he was chosen as captain, and the Crawfords were favored to win the pennant race. The team secured the first half of the championship but finished second in the latter half to the Cuban Giants. As a tiebreaker, both clubs met for a seven-game series to determine the winner of the pennant. In Game Seven, with the Crawfords trailing 7–4 and down to their final out, Johnson hit an infield single to load the bases and kept Pittsburgh's pennant hopes alive. Charleston followed next in the order and hit a walk-off grand slam to win the game and the series. Although the Crawfords finished the second half of 1936 in first place and Johnson showed little signs of slowing down with age, Greenlee shockingly traded him and Gibson to the Homestead Grays in exchange for Pepper Bassett and Henry Spearman, both of whom were considered marginal players at best. Johnson took the deal personally; he played for a few games at the beginning of the 1937 season and announced his retirement soon after.", "h_score": 1613577.0625, "h_score_cat": 5, "pageid": 696764, "revid": 1173140147, "description": "American baseball player, manager, and scout", "categories": ["1899 births", "1989 deaths", "20th-century African-American sportspeople", "Baseball players from Maryland", "Baseball players from Wilmington, Delaware", "Hilldale Club players", "Homestead Grays players", "Major League Baseball scouts", "National Baseball Hall of Fame inductees", "Negro league baseball managers", "People from Snow Hill, Maryland", "Philadelphia Athletics scouts", "Philadelphia Phillies coaches", "Pittsburgh Crawfords players"], "task": "SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD", "creativity_level": "HYBRID", "length_words": 100, "blueprint": {"scenario_hook": "A college professor researching early Negro League players wants a concise overview of Judy Johnson’s career, especially his managerial roles and key achievements during the 1930s.", "audience": "sports historians", "intent": "Compile a detailed timeline and highlights of Judy Johnson’s baseball career, focusing on team affiliations and notable performances.", "constraints_soft": ["emphasize 1930s era", "include batting stats where available", "present in chronological order", "avoid extraneous player details", "keep concise", "use bullet points"], "seed_topics": ["Judy Johnson", "Negro league baseball", "player manager", "career timeline", "team transitions", "Hall of Fame"], "tone_hints": ["informative", "professional"]}, "quality_checks": {"mentions_wikipedia": false, "has_measurable_constraints": true, "includes_subject": true, "natural_sounding": true}}

The facade is divided into numerous architectural bays, which generally contain groupings of three narrow, slightly-recessed windows on each floor. The western facade is divided into eight bays, all of which contain 3 windows on each floor, except for the southernmost bay, which only contains 2 windows. The eastern facade is divided into nine bays; the northernmost and southernmost bays contain 2 windows while the remaining seven bays contain 3 windows. A similar pattern can be found on the longer northern and southern facades, where most of the bays contain 3 windows, while the end bays and two of the center bays contain 2 windows. Loading docks, now sealed, were located on the western, northern, and southern facades.\n\nLittle ornamentation was used on the facade. A concrete marquee was located along the western half of the southern facade, above the loading docks. Other features of the facade included a concrete cornice at the top of the building, as well as inward-sloping walls and long uninterrupted wall sections. In a letter to Gilbert dated April 3, 1913, Turner Construction wrote that \"Concrete, for grocery warehouses, has become almost the standard form of construction throughout the century.\" Gilbert later said, \"The nature of the materials dictates the form of all its parts, and assuming that the purpose of the structure is kept in mind, as it should be, this purpose is necessarily expressed in very simple terms.\"\n\nGilbert chose to place emphasis on the scale of the building's dimensions, saying that a building's \"principal claim to beauty\" was derived from its proportion instead of its decoration. Havemeyer had originally asked Gilbert to design the western facade on the riverfront so that it would appear as massive as possible. While the initial proposals featured three different variants of window fenestration, the final plans simplified the design to the extent that the facades were all nearly identical. To save money, the windows' recessions were reduced in depth, but Havemeyer agreed to add rounded mullions between the two or three window panes in each bay.

Austin Heller, the city's commissioner of air pollution control, said he nearly declared a first-stage alert between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. on November 24. Heller said the index had reached a high of 60.6–10 points higher than the \"emergency\" mark—between 8 and 9 p.m., and the 60.6 reading was possibly the highest in the city's history. After a nighttime lull, Heller cautioned, the smog would likely spike again in the morning.\n\nThe unusually heavy smog was evident to the crowd of one million onlookers at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Tabloids and newspapers that ordinarily ran front-page stories about the parade instead carried stories about the smog. Health officials cautioned those with chronic lung diseases to stay indoors and advised patients that symptoms of pollution-related illness usually lagged 24 hours after exposure.\n\nThat day, the city closed all 11 of its municipal garbage incinerators. Energy companies Consolidated Edison (called Con Ed for short) and Long Island Lighting Company were asked to burn natural gas rather than fuel oil to minimize the release of sulfur dioxide; both companies voluntarily cut back emissions, with Con Ed reducing its emissions by 50 percent. The city told 18 inspectors \"to forget their turkey dinners and start looking for dirty air,\" and they issued an \"unusually high\" number of citations for emissions violations, including two for Con Ed plants. Representative William Fitts Ryan of Manhattan sent a telegram to Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare John W. Gardner to request an emergency meeting with New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, New Jersey Governor Richard J. Hughes, and other regional leaders.\n\n", "h_score": 1670410.2000000002, "h_score_cat": 6, "pageid": 51545978, "revid": 1173289427, "description": "Air-pollution episode in New York City", "categories": ["1966 health disasters", "1966 in New York City", "1966 in the environment", "1966 natural disasters in the United States", "Air pollution in New York City", "Environmental disasters in the United States", "Environmental issues in New York City", "Natural disasters in New York City", "November 1966 events in the United States", "Smog events"], "task": "INTERNAL_BRIEFING_MEMO", "creativity_level": "FACTUAL", "length_words": 100, "blueprint": {"scenario_hook": "I am preparing an educational lecture about the infamous 1966 New York City smog event that occurred during Thanksgiving Day and want to illustrate how city officials responded.", "audience": "teachers students", "intent": "to create a concise summary of key actions taken by NYC authorities during the smog, including emission reductions and public advisories.", "constraints_soft": ["focus on city officials' decisions", "highlight environmental policies", "mention public health warnings", "use descriptive language", "avoid precise dates"], "seed_topics": ["smog alert", "emission reduction", "public health advisories", "industrial emissions", "government response"], "tone_hints": ["informative", "concise"]}, "quality_checks": {"mentions_wikipedia": false, "has_measurable_constraints": true, "includes_subject": true, "natural_sounding": true}}

The video deals directly with the lyrics' theme of Stefani's search for inspiration in songwriting. It opens with a lengthy non-musical section in which Stefani arrives in Los Angeles off of No Doubt's Rock Steady Tour. She receives several calls from Interscope label head Jimmy Iovine, who attempts to push her forward with her solo debut project, but she replies that she is tired and uninspired. After a failed studio attempt, Stefani sees a flyer advertising help for writer's block. Upon arrival, she is asked to fill out a suspicious questionnaire, where the camera pans to the questions which will be important. She is then told that she will be billed when she is finished. She asks for clarification only to discover that she is already back in the studio by herself. When Stefani picks up an oversized pocket watch from the piano, a rabbit knick-knack that she had previously seen jumps across the room. She throws the watch at the knick-knack, causing her to fall back on her wooden chair and find herself transported to a fantasy world based on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass. Stefani portrays several characters from the books, including Alice, the White Queen, and the Red Queen, in dresses by British-Gibraltarian fashion designer John Galliano. The video frequently cuts to Stefani back in the studio to show her singing and performing in semi-synchronization with her actions within her fantasy world. As this transpires the song is recording itself. Stefani ultimately rediscovers her confidence, and her full awareness is transported back to the ordinary reality of the studio just as she dances in front of her four giggling Harajuku Girls. She then is presented with her bill by the consultant as the chair topples to the floor. There are four versions of the video. The full, long version is one minute longer than the Making the Video version, while the cut version omits the scenes in which she leaves the airport and is sleepy and in which she fills out the questionnaire. The short version begins with Stefani practicing on the piano and her finding the watch just seconds after that. Her being billed is not shown in this version, so the video ends with the Harajuku Girls laughing at her performance. The music video was well-received by many reviewers. Sam Bloch from Stylus Magazine referred to it as a short film, comparing it to Michael Jackson's Thriller, and commented, \"I sigh with admiration and wish every video was this alive.\" The video debuted on MTV's Total Request Live on October 19, 2004, at number 11. The following month it reached the top of the chart and was there for three non-consecutive days, remaining over five weeks on the program. At the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, the video won the award for Best Art Direction and was nominated for Best Editing. At the 2005 MuchMusic Video Awards, the video was nominated for Best International Video but lost to Usher's \"Caught Up\".

The game was held on July 10, 2007, at AT&T Park, the home of the NL's San Francisco Giants. It marked the third time that the Giants hosted the All Star Game since moving to San Francisco for the 1958 season. The 1961 and 1984 All Star Games were played at the Giants former home Candlestick Park, and the fourth overall in the Bay Area, with the Giants bay area rivals the Oakland Athletics hosting once back in 1987, and the second straight held in an NL ballpark.\n\nThe American League defeated the National League by a score of 5–4. Ichiro Suzuki won the MVP award for the game for hitting the first inside-the-park home run in All-Star history. As per the 2006 Collective Bargaining Agreement, the American League champion (which eventually came to be the Boston Red Sox) received home field advantage in the 2007 World Series. The victory was the 10th consecutive (excluding the 2002 tie) for the AL, and their 11-game unbeaten streak is only beaten by the NL's 11-game winning streak from 1972 to 1982 in All-Star history.\n\n ## Background\n\nAs with each All-Star Game since 1970, the eight starting position players (with no designated hitter due to playing in an NL stadium) of each league were elected by fan balloting. The remaining players were selected by a players' vote, each league's team manager, and a second fan balloting to add one more player to each roster. In all, 32 players were selected to each league's team, not including players who decline to play due to injuries or personal reasons.\n\nThe Giants were awarded the game on February 9, 2005. The game marked the first time since 1962 that one league hosted consecutive All-Star Games, after Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, hosted the game in 2006.\n\nThe game was the fifth straight All-Star Game to decide home-field advantage in the World Series. The AL entered the game on a ten-game unbeaten streak (nine wins, with one tie in 2002). The NL was looking for their first win since the 1996 game in Philadelphia.\n\n ## Fan balloting\n\n ### Starters\n\nBalloting for the 2007 All-Star Game starters (excluding pitchers) began on April 27 and continued through June 28. The top vote-getters at each position and the top three among outfielders are named the starters for their respective leagues. The results were announced on July 1. About 18.5 million votes were cast by close to 12 million fans. Alex Rodriguez was the leading vote-getter with 3,890,515 votes, easily outpacing his Yankees teammate Derek Jeter by over 700,000 votes. Ken Griffey Jr., was the top vote-getter in the National League, with 2,986,818 votes.\n\n ### Final roster spot\n\nAfter the rosters were announced, a second round of fan voting, the Monster All-Star Final Vote, was commenced to determine the occupant of the final roster spot for each team. This round lasted until July 5. Chris Young and Hideki Okajima were elected to represent the National League and American League, respectively, in the All-Star Game as first time All-Stars. All ten players included in the balloting were pitchers, a first for the event.\n\n ## Rosters\n\nPlayers in italics have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\n ### American League\n\n ### National League\n\nThese players did not see action in the game.\nVoted onto the roster through the All-Star Final Vote.\nUnable to play due to injury.

Initially, it was believed to be the same storm that struck Guadeloupe on the same day, though subsequent research indicated there were two separate storms. The hurricane tracked by the Bahamas while tracking generally northward, and it attained major hurricane status over the western Atlantic Ocean. As it approached the United States coastline, the hurricane was very intense, with winds estimated at over 135 mph (215 km/h) and potentially as strong as 160 mph (255 km/h), or a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. Late on September 2, the hurricane made landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina and later turned to the northeast to cross the Pamlico Sound.\n\nThe hurricane accelerated northeastward, and passed over the Hampton Roads area early on September 3. After crossing the Chesapeake Bay, the cyclone traversed the Delmarva Peninsula near the Atlantic coastline, and at around 1500 UTC the eye passed directly over Cape Henlopen, Delaware; a thirty-minute period of calm was reported. It continued across the Delaware Bay and later passed over Cape May, New Jersey, where a fifteen-minute calm was reported. Modern researchers estimate it was a Category 3 or Category 4 hurricane upon striking New Jersey, one of the few hurricanes to hit the state. Moving ashore at very low tide, it paralleled the state's coastline just inland, and after exiting into Lower New York Bay the hurricane made landfall on New York City at around 1930 UTC on September 3; this makes it the only major hurricane to directly hit the city. A minimal hurricane in 1893 also made landfall on what later became part of New York City. One modern researcher estimates the hurricane was moving at a forward speed of 35 mph (55 km/h), and upon moving ashore had a pressure of 965 mbar. The hurricane continued northeastward through New England, and after entering Massachusetts on September 4 its exact path was unknown; one researcher estimated the cyclone tracked northeastward until losing its identity over southeastern Maine, while another assessed the storm as passing far to the west of Maine.\n\nBased on the arrangement of effects in New England, meteorologist William C. Redfield deduced that the wind field and center of tropical cyclones are circular; previously the winds were believed to be in a straight line.\n\n", "h_score": 1638383.8875000002, "h_score_cat": 6, "pageid": 2839335, "revid": 1170500070, "description": "Category 4 Atlantic hurricane in September 1821", "categories": ["1820s Atlantic hurricane seasons", "1821 disasters in the United States", "1821 meteorology", "1821 natural disasters in the United States", "Category 4 Atlantic hurricanes", "Hurricanes in Delaware", "Hurricanes in Maryland", "Hurricanes in New England", "Hurricanes in New Jersey", "Hurricanes in New York (state)", "Hurricanes in North Carolina", "Hurricanes in Virginia", "Hurricanes in Washington, D.C.", "Natural disasters in New York City", "September 1821 events"], "task": "NEWS_ARTICLE", "creativity_level": "FACTUAL", "length_words": 100, "blueprint": {"scenario_hook": "I’m a graduate student researching historic hurricane impacts on coastal communities and need detailed information about the 1821 Norfolk and Long Island hurricane for my thesis.", "audience": "researchers", "intent": "Provide an in-depth analysis of the storm’s trajectory, intensity, and effects on Norfolk and Long Island.", "constraints_soft": ["focus on historical context and contemporary reports", "include socioeconomic impact and local anecdotes", "maintain a neutral academic tone", "avoid modern data or recent statistics"], "seed_topics": ["storm path", "wind intensity", "impact on New York City", "historical records", "societal aftermath"], "tone_hints": ["academic", "informative"]}, "quality_checks": {"mentions_wikipedia": false, "has_measurable_constraints": true, "includes_subject": true, "natural_sounding": true}}

The conference was chaired by the Long Island State Park commissioner at the time, Robert Moses, who would later become the New York City Parks commissioner. The report included a 100-acre (40 ha) Spring Creek Park as well the Shore Parkway portion of the Belt Parkway, both in Brooklyn. The Metropolitan Park Conference called the Spring Creek site '\"the last opportunity in Brooklyn for a new park of substantial size which can be acquired at reasonable cost.'\" By October of that year, it was determined that the swampy land would have to be filled in order to turn it into a proper park. At this time, the 150-acre (61 ha) tract was bound by Fountain Avenue to the west, Cozine Avenue (then Fairfield Avenue) to the north, and Sheridan Avenue to the east, on the western banks of Spring Creek where the water treatment plant now sits. Moses planned to create several parks on wetlands by filling the land with municipal waste before developing the land into parkland. These included the future Spring Creek Park and sites in Marine Park, Brooklyn; Ferry Point, Bronx; Fresh Kills, Staten Island; and Edgemere, Queens. In August 1942, the New York City Planning Commission and Board of Estimate approved the Spring Creek Park project as part of the city's post-World War II program. By 1948, portions of the park in Brooklyn were landfilled. On August 20, 1948, the New York City Board of Estimate approved the creation of a \"Super Dump\" at Spring Creek Park, to the west of what was then Howard Beach (now Old Howard Beach). The new dump would replace smaller landfills in other areas of Queens and reduce the load on the Edgemere Landfill. The landfill would operate until the completion of the nearby South Shore Incinerator in Spring Creek. Afterwards, the landfill would become part of the park. Bids for preparation of the site were opened on September 17, 1948. This work involved grading the site and installing a dyke around the landfill to prevent the runoff of garbage into Jamaica Bay. Landfilling began in Howard Beach on January 17, 1949. The dump was located on a 125-acre (51 ha) site along Jamaica Bay stretching west from Cross Bay Boulevard to the Brooklyn-Queens border at Old Mill Creek. It extended north 0.5 miles (0.80 km) to 165th Avenue. Prior to filling, it was a tidal marsh, with the nearest homes said to be located as far as 0.5 miles (0.80 km) away. The fill would raise the grade of the future park by 16 feet (4.9 m). The \"Super Dump\" was anticipated to operate for three years, after which it would be replaced by incinerators. In addition to sand, chemicals would be applied to the garbage in order to eliminated odors. By August 1949 the filling of the marshland, which was described as having \"its own odors, its unsightly heaps of rubbish and its rotted pilings\", received positive feedback from local communities including the absence of foul odors. The newly-reclaimed land along the coast drew comparisons to Jones Beach in Nassau County, which had also been developed by Robert Moses. At both Spring Creek and Marine Park, sewage sludge from wastewater plants was mixed with sand to create \"synthetic topsoil\" in order to provide a base for future vegetation. The projects were referred to as \"Operation Sludge\". The South Shore Incinerator was opened on June 30, 1954. At this time, Robert Moses' plans called for Spring Creek Park to extend east to Cross Bay Boulevard in Howard Beach and include a new beach and boat basin. The Queens Spring Creek landfill, the first portion of the park, was completed between 1956 and 1958, after which additional land reclamation projects began. A 75-acre (30 ha) area was reclaimed in the Queens section of the park. Filling at the Pennsylvania Avenue Landfill began in 1956, while the Fountain Avenue Landfill began operations in 1961 or 1963. The landfill and incinerator operations significantly changed the topography and vegetation of the area. The western Howard Beach peninsula was significantly filled and extended west towards Old Mill Creek, allowing residential development to occur.", "h_score": 1657940.3875000002, "h_score_cat": 6, "pageid": 55751986, "revid": 999327132, "description": "Public park in New York City", "categories": ["East New York, Brooklyn", "Gateway National Recreation Area", "Howard Beach, Queens", "Parks in Brooklyn", "Parks in Queens, New York", "Robert Moses projects", "Urban public parks"], "task": "PRESS_RELEASE", "creativity_level": "FACTUAL", "length_words": 100, "blueprint": {"scenario_hook": "A neighborhood resident planning a walk and wants to know how Spring Creek Park was developed over the years, including landfills and environmental changes.", "audience": "local residents", "intent": "Provide an overview of Spring Creek Park’s development timeline and current environmental status.", "constraints_soft": ["Include historical context about park development", "Mention landfill reclamation and environmental restoration", "Avoid technical jargon", "Highlight community impact"], "seed_topics": ["park development history", "landfill reclamation", "environmental restoration", "local community impact", "future park plans"], "tone_hints": ["informative", "friendly"]}, "quality_checks": {"mentions_wikipedia": false, "has_measurable_constraints": true, "includes_subject": true, "natural_sounding": true}}

It was originally published in 1979 under the title \"Une abominable feuille d'érable sur la glace\" (\"An abominable maple leaf on the ice\"). It was adapted into an animated short called The Sweater (Le Chandail) by the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) in 1980 and illustrated by Sheldon Cohen.\n\nThe story is based on a real experience Carrier had as a child in Sainte-Justine, Quebec, in 1946 as a fan of the Montreal Canadiens hockey team and its star player, Maurice Richard. Carrier and his friends all wear Canadiens' sweaters with Richard's number 9 on the back. When his mother orders a new sweater from the Eaton's department store in the big city after the old one has worn out, he is mistakenly sent a sweater of Montreal's bitter rival, the Toronto Maple Leafs, instead. Carrier faces the persecution of his peers and his coach prevents him from playing.\n\nThe Hockey Sweater is Carrier's most famous work and is considered an iconic piece of Canadian literature. The story has sold over 300,000 copies and has been republished in numerous anthologies. It exemplifies the nation's passion for hockey, and while it is often considered an allegory of the relationship and tensions that exist between francophones and anglophones, the story is popular throughout the entire nation. A line from the story appears on Canadian five-dollar bills as part of the Canadian Journey banknote series printed between 2001 and 2013.\n\n ## Background\n\nIn the aftermath of Quebec's Quiet Revolution, tensions between francophones within the province and anglophones escalated as a provincial movement, led by the governing Parti Québécois, to separate from Canada reached its peak in the late 1970s. Seeking to explain Quebec's independence movement, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's (CBC) Toronto affiliate asked Roch Carrier, whose debut novel La Guerre, Yes Sir had been popular among both French and English Canadians, to explain \"what does Quebec want?\"\n\nCarrier spent several weeks trying to answer the question, ultimately producing what he described as a \"flat essay\" that was \"dull as an editorial in a newspaper\". Three days before his deadline, Carrier informed the CBC that he would not be able to complete the project. He was told that the network had already booked studio time for him and had been promoting his appearance. As he remained unwilling to present his essay, Carrier was asked to write about anything he wanted to fill the time.\n\nConsidering what to write, Carrier thought of his own childhood. He stated in an interview that he began thinking of \"when was it that I felt I was really myself? And I remember it was when I put on my skates and my Eaton catalogues on my legs, and I stood up, and I was taller than my mom, and I had a stick in my hands, so I was stronger than my brother, and I felt that I was little me.

During the height of the AIDS crisis, Sonnabend helped create several AIDS organisations, including the AIDS Medical Foundation (now amfAR), the nonprofit Community Research Initiative (now ACRIA), which pioneered community-based research, and the PWA Health Group, the first and largest formally recognised buyers' club.\n\nSonnabend became controversial for advocating that gay men change their sexual behaviors to avoid sexually-transmitted infections, rather than to just have fewer sexual partners, as advocated by Gay Men's Health Crisis and other gay community organizations and for hypothesizing a multi-factorial model of causation, including for a period of time after discovery of HIV. He was widely respected as a pioneering and compassionate clinician and researcher.\n\n ## Background\n\nSonnabend was born on 6 January 1933 in Johannesburg, South Africa, and grew up in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). His mother was a physician and his father a sociologist. Both parents were Jewish immigrants from Europe.\n\nHe trained in infectious diseases at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. During the 1960s he conducted research at the National Institute for Medical Research in London, where he worked under Alick Isaacs, a pioneer of interferon research.\n\nIn the early 1970s Sonnabend moved to New York City to be an associate professor at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. After losing his interferon research grant he worked at Kings County Hospital Center and as Director of Continuing Medical Education at the Bureau of VD Control for the New York City Department of Health. In 1978 he started a private clinic for sexually transmitted infections in Greenwich Village, for which he was renowned.\n\nSonnabend died on 24 January 2021 at Wellington Hospital in London, as a result of complications arising from a heart attack he had suffered three weeks earlier.\n\n ## Early AIDS work\n\nSonnabend was one of the first physicians to notice among his gay male patients the immune deficiency that would later be named AIDS. His background in microbiology, virology, infectious diseases and prior experience of working with immunocompromised transplant patients helped him to conduct some of the earliest research into AIDS, often at his own expense, independently of government agencies that were slow to respond to the epidemic, In 1983 he was founding editor of one of the first AIDS journals, AIDS Research (renamed AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses in 1986, after Sonnabend was fired from the journal).\n\n ### Multifactorial model of AIDS\n\nPrior to the identification of HIV as the cause of AIDS in 1984, Sonnabend's investigations led him to propose that AIDS among gay men might be caused by multiple factors including Epstein–Barr virus and repeated exposure to cytomegalovirus and semen. This suggestion conflicted with the view that a single agent was likely responsible, which Sonnabend did not rule out.\n\nSonnabend's \"multifactorial model\" led him to argue from very early in the emerging pandemic that frequent unprotected anal sex increased the risk of what would come to be known as AIDS. This was the inspiration for How to Have Sex in an Epidemic, a booklet written under Sonnabend's guidance in 1983 by two of his patients, Michael Callen and Richard Berkowitz, in which this model is described. At the time, attempts to change sexual behaviour and the recommendation of condoms for gay sex met with criticism from many prominent gay community figures. Later, Sonnabend's advice regarding condoms would be accepted as fundamental to HIV prevention.\n\n", "h_score": 1685592.1625, "h_score_cat": 6, "pageid": 7886717, "revid": 1161615417, "description": "South African physician (1933–2021)", "categories": ["1933 births", "2021 deaths", "20th-century South African LGBT people", "20th-century South African physicians", "American infectious disease physicians", "HIV/AIDS activists", "HIV/AIDS researchers", "LGBT physicians", "South African Jews", "South African LGBT scientists", "South African expatriates in the United Kingdom", "South African expatriates in the United States"], "task": "PRESS_RELEASE", "creativity_level": "FACTUAL", "length_words": 100, "blueprint": {"scenario_hook": "A graduate student preparing a literature review on early AIDS research wants to understand Joseph Sonnabend’s contributions and the impact of his multifactorial model.", "audience": "students, researchers", "intent": "Provide a concise overview of Sonnabend's role in early HIV/AIDS research, focusing on community-based initiatives and safe‑sex advocacy.", "constraints_soft": ["Emphasize historical significance", "Avoid direct controversy", "Highlight community‑based research", "Mention safe‑sex recommendations", "Provide balanced perspective"], "seed_topics": ["Early AIDS research", "Multifactorial model", "Community-based research", "Safe sex advocacy", "Sonnabend's contributions"], "tone_hints": ["Informative", "Balanced", "Professional"]}, "quality_checks": {"mentions_wikipedia": false, "has_measurable_constraints": true, "includes_subject": true, "natural_sounding": true}}

By the time of Domesday Book in 1086, Urse's powers as sheriff had been excluded from the Oswaldslaw, the area of Worcestershire controlled by the bishops of Worcester. Domesday Book records that the Oswaldslaw was regarded as an immunity, exempt from judicial actions by royal officials. Urse complained that this immunity reduced his income, but this did not affect the outcome of his dispute with Wulfstan, who prevailed. Although Wulfstan claimed that the immunity dated from before the Conquest, it actually owed its existence to the ability of the bishop to fill the shire court with his supporters, and thus influence the findings of the court. Urse was also involved in a dispute between Wulfstan and Evesham Abbey over lands in Worcestershire as, after the Conquest, Urse acquired the lands of Azur, a kinsman of an earlier Bishop of Worcester, Beorhtheah. Azur had originally leased the lands from the diocese, but after Urse confiscated the lands, the sheriff did not return the lands to the bishop, and instead kept them for himself. The Worcester monk Hemming recorded the loss of the lands to Urse in Hemming's Cartulary, a cartulary written about 1095 recording lands and charters belonging to the diocese of Worcester. Hemmings' Cartulary mentions not just Azur's lands, but others at Acton Beauchamp, Clopton, and Redmarley as taken from the diocese of Worcester by Urse. After Abbot Æthelwig's death, Urse also acquired lands that Æthelwig had seized through less than legal means, when William I's half-brother Odo of Bayeux, the Bishop of Bayeux, presided at the lawsuit brought to determine the ownership of the lands. Odo gave a number of the disputed estates to Urse during the course of the lawsuit. The 12th-century chronicler William of Malmesbury records how, shortly after Urse was appointed sheriff, he built a castle which encroached on the cemetery of the cathedral chapter of Worcester Cathedral. Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, pronounced a rhyming curse on Urse, declaring \"Thou are called Urse. May you have God's curse.\" Ealdred had been Bishop of Worcester before becoming archbishop, and still retained an interest in the diocese. Gerald of Wales, a late 12th- and early 13th-century writer, wrote that Wulfstan uttered the curse after Urse had attempted to have Wulfstan deposed as bishop. Gerald goes on to relate that Wulfstan stated he would only relinquish his episcopal staff to the king who had granted it, William I's predecessor, Edward the Confessor. Gerard then reports that Wulfstan proceeded to work a miracle at Edward's tomb, a miracle so impressive that King William confirmed Wulfstan in his episcopate. Although Urse did not succeed in removing Wulfstan, and although there are certainly embellishments added in Gerald's story, it is clear that Urse and Wulfstan were the main powers in Worcestershire, and were thus great rivals. The Archbishop's curse had no discernible effect, either on Urse's career or the castle. Other chroniclers record that Urse stole monastic lands, including some from Evesham Abbey. Urse gained a reputation for greed and avarice, especially with regard to church lands.

Rohan and Gondor are combined into one faction called Men of the West. Along with Mordor and Isengard from the first game, there are six playable factions. The troops of Gondor provide a solid offense and defense with standard infantry and archers, and the Rohirrim of Rohan act as elite cavalry. The Elven archers are effective at inflicting damage from a distance, and their support units, the Ents, can perform a combination of melee and siege attacks, they are often considered the strongest defensive faction due to their strong missile units and powerful 'silverthorn arrows'. Although slow and expensive, Dwarven infantry, pikemen, and axe-throwers are very powerful and well-armored allowing them to prevail in even the longest clashes with enemy troops. A collection of wild creatures and beasts of Middle-earth make up the Goblin faction, this includes Goblins, Trolls (particularly Cave Trolls, Attack Trolls, Mountain Trolls, Drummer Trolls, and Half-Troll Marauders), Giant Spiders, Mountain Giants, Dragons, and Fire Drakes, which are effective in large numbers. Their only advantage is that the goblin archer and soldier units are cheap to make at only 75 resources and build faster than other basic infantry. Isengard troops are highly trained Uruk-hai under Saruman's command. Berserkers are used by Isengard as one-man armies that move extremely fast and deal significant damage (particularly to enemy buildings and heroes). Additionally, Isengard is the only Evil faction that can build walls. Mordor forces are a mixture of Orcs, Men, Trolls, Mûmakil, and Sauron's lieutenants. Mordor Orcs have tough armor, making them useful for absorbing enemy damage while stronger units attack enemies. Trolls contribute greatly to the Mordor offensives, having strong melee attacks and the ability to throw boulders or wield trees like swords. ## Plot\n\nSet in the regions of northern Middle-earth, the game focuses on the events of the War in the North. For the sake of gameplay, the game takes several liberties with Tolkien's works and the film trilogy. Some characters were altered in their appearances, abilities, and roles; for instance, a combat role in the game is given to Tom Bombadil, a merry and mysterious hermit who appears in The Lord of the Rings but does not take part in the war. In addition, Tolkien's earlier novel The Hobbit lends several elements to the game, including characters such as the Giant Spiders from Mirkwood. The story for The Battle for Middle-earth II is divided into Good and Evil Campaigns. Both campaigns focus on the battles fought by the newly introduced factions: the Elves, Dwarves, and Goblins. The player goes through nine fixed missions on either Easy, Medium, or Hard difficulty mode.

From a young age he was exposed to oral and written pantuns and syair, both listening and improvisationally creating his own. As with his father before him, Amir enjoyed traditional texts, such as Hikayat Hang Tuah, Syair Siti Zubaidah, and Hikayat Panca Tanderan. He would listen to these when they were read in public ceremonies, and as an adult he kept a large collection of such texts, though these were destroyed during the communist revolution. Throughout his formal education Amir read works of Arabic, Persian, and Hindu literature. He was also influenced by works from other Eastern countries: poems translated in Setanggi Timur, for instance, include works by Omar Khayyám (Persia), Du Fu (China), Fukuda Chiyo-ni (Japan), and Rabindranath Tagore (India). These works were not read in the original, but from Dutch translations. The literary critic Muhammad Balfas writes that, unlike his contemporaries, Amir drew little influence from sonnets and the neo-romantic Dutch poets, the Tachtigers; Johns comes to the same conclusion. The Australian literary scholar Keith Foulcher, however, noting that the poet quoted Willem Kloos's \"Lenteavond\" in his article on pantuns, suggests that Amir was very likely influenced by the Tachtigers. Many writers have commented on Amir's influence from Islamic doctrine. The Indonesian literary documentarian H. B. Jassin and the poet Arief Bagus Prasetyo, among others, argue that Amir was a purely orthodox Muslim and that it showed in his work. Prasetyo argues that this was evident in his treatment of God; he does not view God as his equal, a theme found in the works of such Sufi poets as Hamzah Fansuri, but as the master to Amir's servant. Johns writes that, though he was not a mystic, Amir was also not a purely devotional writer, instead promoting a form of \"Islamic Humanism\". Others, such as the Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw and the Indonesian scholar of literature Abdul Hadi WM, find Amir to be influenced by Sufism. Aprinus Salam of Gadjah Mada University, of the same position, points to the instances where Hamzah treats God as a lover as indicative of Sufi influence. Ultimately, the poet Chairil Anwar wrote that Amir's Nyanyi Sunyi could be termed \"obscure poetry\" as readers cannot understand the works without prior knowledge of Malay history and Islam. Some attempts have also been made to connect Amir's works to a Christian perspective. In analysing \"Padamu Jua\", the Indonesian critic Bakri Siregar suggests that some influences from the Christian Bible are evident, pointing to several aspects of the poem that would seem to support such a view, including the depiction of an anthropomorphic God (not allowed in orthodox Islam) and the idea of a jealous God.", "h_score": 1644687.3375000001, "h_score_cat": 6, "pageid": 34186501, "revid": 1171851819, "description": "Indonesian poet (1911–1946)", "categories": ["1911 births", "1946 deaths", "20th-century male writers", "20th-century translators", "Amir Hamzah", "Executed Indonesian people", "Executed royalty", "Indonesian male poets", "Indonesian people of Malay descent", "Indonesian translators", "Murdered royalty", "National Heroes of Indonesia", "People from Langkat Regency"], "task": "NEWS_ARTICLE", "creativity_level": "FACTUAL", "length_words": 100, "blueprint": {"scenario_hook": "I’m preparing a lecture on Indonesian poetry and need a concise overview of Amir Hamzah’s literary influences.", "audience": "students, academics", "intent": "to provide a succinct summary of the major literary influences shaping Amir Hamzah's poetic style", "constraints_soft": ["avoid explicit dates", "focus on thematic influences rather than chronology", "use accessible language", "include cross-cultural aspects"], "seed_topics": ["Malay court setting", "Pantuns and syair tradition", "Sufi influence", "Tachtigers", "Islamic humanism"], "tone_hints": ["scholarly", "informative"]}, "quality_checks": {"mentions_wikipedia": false, "has_measurable_constraints": true, "includes_subject": true, "natural_sounding": true}}

Cover IWF’s key positions on equity feminism, Title IX enforcement, healthcare policy, campus programs, and international initiatives. Aim for ~100 words total ±15%.", "title": "Independent Women's Forum", "reference": "## Equity feminism\n\nThe IWF opposes many mainstream feminist positions, describing them as \"radical feminism\", but rather focuses on equity feminism. IWF-affiliated writers have argued that the sex gap in income exists because of IWF women's greater demand for flexibility, fewer hours, and less travel in their careers, rather than because of sexism. In an article for the Dallas Morning News, IWF Vice-president Carrie Lukas attributed sex disparities in income to \"[IWF] women's own choices\", writing that [IWF] women \"tend to place a higher priority on flexibility and personal fulfillment than do men, who focus more on pay. [IWF women] tend to avoid jobs that require travel or relocation, and they take more time off and spend fewer hours in the office than men do. Men disproportionately take on the most dirty, dangerous and depressing jobs.\"\n\nThe IWF also argues that feminists manufacture domestic violence legislation that \"is misleading because it is premised on and mean to advance feminist ideology.\" This falls under their larger belief that \"feminists ... lie about data, are opportunistic, construct men as the enemy, and cast women as helpless victims.\"\n\nConservative commentators have praised the IWF; Linda Chavez credited Women's Figures: An Illustrated Guide to the Economic Progress of Women in America, a 1999 book published in part by the IWF, with \"debunk[ing] much of the feminists' voodoo economics.\" Writing in Capitalism Magazine, John Stossel cited Michelle Bernard's 2007 book Women's Progress as evidence that \"American women have never enjoyed more options or such a high quality of life.\"\n\nSome writers have asserted that feminist rhetoric is used by the IWF for anti-feminist ends. A New York Times editorial described the IWF as \"a right-wing public policy group that provides pseudofeminist support for extreme positions that are in fact dangerous to women.\"\n\n ## Domestic policy and programs\n\n ### United States healthcare policy\n\nIn 2009, IWF produced a political advertisement run on YouTube and in eight states arguing that \"300,000 American women with breast cancer might have died\" if U.S. healthcare included a government-funded option. FactCheck.org labeled the IWF ad \"a false appeal to women's fears\", finding that the IWF ad relied on \"old statistics, faulty logic and false insinuations.\"\n\n #### Title IX enforcement\n\nSince shortly after the organization's inception, the IWF has joined with groups like the National Wrestling Coaches Association in opposing the manner in which the United States Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights has enforced Title IX legislation requiring sex equality in public educational investment. The 1972 Title IX law that states: \"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\"\n\n #### Campus programs\n\nThe organization emphasizes patriarchal sex roles and cultural norms as essential for civil society. In particular, IWF encourages young women to embrace what it presents as a healthy attitude towards dating, courtship, and marriage. This emphasis is reflected by high-profile, sometimes controversial work on college campuses where IWF sponsors advertising campaigns and literature distribution to promote its views. One such effort included the running of advertisements with provocative headings such as \"The Ten Most Common Feminist Myths.\" IWF also offers internships and sponsors an annual essay contest open to full-time female undergraduate students.\n\nAs a reaction to reports of growing promiscuity on college campuses and the V-Day movement founded by Eve Ensler, IWF created its \"Take Back the Date\" campus program to \"reclaim Valentine's Day from radical feminists on campus who use a day of love and romance to promote vulgar and promiscuous behavior through activities like The Vagina Monologues.\" Specifically addressing the controversial play, IWF's \"Take Back the Date\" release states that, \"although the play raises money for a good cause, the hyper-sexualized play counteracts the positive contributions of the feminist movement and degrades women.\"\n\nIn an article in The Guardian, feminist writer Jessica Valenti asserted that the program was merely \"[r]evamping outdated notions of femininity and positioning them as cutting edge.\"\n\n ## International programs\n\nSince its founding, IWF has sponsored numerous conferences, panels, and other programs designed to promote its message to an international audience. These primarily include activities and events discussing or taking place in the countries of Iraq and Afghanistan, and focus on promoting female participation in democracy.\n\nThe IWF has also had a hand in international women's programs and initiatives. For example, \"in the spring of 2002, the IWF's President, Nancy Pfotenhauer, was appointed by U.S. President George W. Bush to be a delegate to the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women.\"\n\nIn October 2004, the Feminist Majority Foundation objected to the U.S. Department of State's decision to award part of a grant to IWF. IWF's work in Iraq is in concert with that of the American Islamic Conference and the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a neo-conservative think tank.\n\n ## Funding\n\nDonors to IWF have included Donors Trust, the John William Pope Foundation, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, the Scaife Foundations, the Randolph Foundation, and the John M. Olin Foundation. Another major sponsor is the Charles Koch Institute, while Facebook, Dick DeVos and the Walton Family Foundation have also given money to the organization.\n\n ## Board members\n\nThe board is chaired by businesswoman Heather Higgins with other members Yvonne Boice, Kellyanne Conway (temporary leave of absence), Giovanna Cugnasca, Nan Hayworth, Larry Kudlow, and Adele Malpass.

Subsequent authors noted similarities to modern African great apes. In his The Descent of Man, Darwin briefly noted that Dryopithecus casts doubt on the African origin of apes: > ...it is somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the African continent than elsewhere. But it is useless to speculate on this subject; for two or three anthropomorphous apes, one the Dryopithecus of Lartet, nearly as large as a man, and closely allied to Hylobates, existed in Europe during the Miocene age; and since so remote a period the earth has certainly undergone many great revolutions, and there has been ample time for migration on the largest scale. Dryopithecus taxonomy has been the subject of much turmoil, with new specimens being the basis of a new species or genus based on minute differences, resulting in several now-defunct species. By the 1960s, all non-human apes were classified into the now-obsolete family Pongidae, and extinct apes into Dryopithecidae. In 1965, English palaeoanthropologist David Pilbeam and American palaeontologist Elwyn L. Simons separated the genus–which included specimens from across the Old World at the time–into three subgenera: Dryopithecus in Europe, Sivapithecus in Asia, and Proconsul in Africa. Afterwards, there was discussion over whether each of these subgenera should be elevated to genus. In 1979, Sivapithecus was elevated to genus, and Dryopithecus was subdivided again into the subgenera Dryopithecus in Europe, and Proconsul, Limnopithecus, and Rangwapithecus in Africa. Since that time, several more species were assigned and moved, and by the 21st century, the genus included D. fontani, D. brancoi, D. laietanus, and D. crusafonti. However, the 2009 discovery of a partial skull of D. fontani caused many of them to be split off into different genera, such as the newly erected Hispanopithecus, because part of the confusion was caused by the fragmentary nature of the Dryopithecus holotype with vague and incomplete diagnostic characteristics. Currently, there is only one uncontested species, D. fontani. Specimens are: - Holotype MNHNP AC 36, three pieces of a male mandible with teeth from Saint-Gaudens in the French Pyrenees. Based on dental development in chimpanzees, it was 6 to 8 years old, and several diagnostic characteristics made from the holotype would be lost in mature D. fontani; A partial left humerus arm bone, an additional mandible (MNHNP 1872-2), a left lower jaw and five isolated teeth are also known from the site. - An upper incisor, NMB G.a.9., and female upper molar, FSL 213981, come from Saint-Alban-de-Roche, France. - A male partial face, IPS35026, and femur, IPS41724, from Vallès Penedès in Catalonia, Spain. - A female mandible with teeth, LMK-Pal 5508, from St. Stefan, Carinthia, Austria 12.5 mya, which could possibly be considered a separate species, \"D. carinthiacus\". Dryopithecus is classified into the namesake great ape tribe Dryopithecini, along with Hispanopithecus, Rudapithecus, Ouranopithecus, Anoiapithecus, and Pierolapithecus, though the latter two may belong to Dryopithecus, the former two may be synonymous, and the former three can also be placed into their own tribes. Dryopithecini is either regarded as an offshoot of orangutans (Ponginae), an ancestor to African apes and humans (Homininae), or its own separate branch (Dryopithecinae). Dryopithecus was a part of an adaptive radiation of great apes in the expanding forests of Europe in the warm climates of the Miocene Climatic Optimum, possibly descending from early or middle Miocene African apes which diversified in the proceeding Middle Miocene disruption (a cooling event). It is possible great apes first evolved in Europe or Asia, and then migrated down into Africa.", "h_score": 1689620.0562500001, "h_score_cat": 6, "pageid": 2361264, "revid": 1170979425, "description": "Extinct great ape from Europe", "categories": ["Fossil taxa described in 1856", "Miocene primates", "Miocene primates of Europe", "Prehistoric apes", "Prehistoric primate genera"], "task": "NEWS_ARTICLE", "creativity_level": "VERY_CREATIVE", "length_words": 100, "blueprint": {"scenario_hook": "I’m preparing a short presentation on the evolutionary history of European great ape species and need concise, engaging content about Dryopithecus.", "audience": "paleontology students", "intent": "Provide a clear overview of Dryopithecus taxonomy and its significance in apes' evolution.", "constraints_soft": ["short narrative", "avoid heavy technical details", "highlight key discoveries", "focus on European context"], "seed_topics": ["taxonomy controversies", "Miocene climate impact", "European fossil sites", "species differentiation", "apex lineage"], "tone_hints": ["informative", "engaging", "academic"]}, "quality_checks": {"mentions_wikipedia": false, "has_measurable_constraints": true, "includes_subject": true, "natural_sounding": true}}

Target length: 100 words (+/-15%).", "title": "Ferrari P4/5 by Pininfarina", "reference": "## Development In March 2005, Glickenhaus, son of stock exchange magnate and a car collector, was approached by Pininfarina who asked if he was interested in commissioning a one-off car. Andrea Pininfarina, grandson of the company's founder later said \"The Ferrari 612 Kappa and this P4/5 are the first. But we want to grow this business.\" indicating that Pininfarina is interested in producing other unique cars. Glickenhaus replied that he would like a modern Ferrari P, and in June of that year he signed a contract with Pininfarina to produce the car including the price, approximately US\\$4 million though in an interview he said \"I feel they gave me more than I expected\". Glickenhaus purchased the last unsold Enzo Ferrari and upon receipt of the car he took it to Pininfarina to be redesigned similar to his David Piper P4 replica which he also delivered to Pininfarina. Pininfarina's styling team leader, Ken Okuyama said that \"Pininfarina wanted to stay away from retro design and move towards a more forward thinking supercar\" as they were excited by the opportunity to build the car, not just design it. Its design began in September 2005 with sketches by Jason Castriota moving through computer-aided sculpture and stringent wind tunnel testing. More than 200 components were designed especially for the car. Most components, including the engine, and drivetrain, are modified from the original Enzo Ferrari. The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is unchanged from the Enzo from which it was derived. The P4/5 was publicly revealed on August 18, 2006, at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elégance and shown again at the Paris Motor Show in late September. Upon seeing the P4/5, Luca di Montezemolo felt that the car deserved to be officially badged as a Ferrari. Montezemeolo, along with Andrea Pininfarina and James Glickenhaus, agreed that its official name would be \"Ferrari P4/5 by Pininfarina\". Ted West wrote an article in Car and Driver about how this came to be \"The Beast of Turin\". In September 2009, Glickenhaus announced his intention to race a new version of the P4/5 in 2010 24 Hours Nürburgring. The car, called the SCG P4/5 Competizione, would not be a conversion of his road car but instead an entirely new car with a Ferrari chassis, VIN and drivetrain, made under Glickenhaus's own car brand Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus. In May 2010 however, it was revealed that the Competizione would in fact be raced in 2011, based on a 430 Scuderia. It would be built to FIA GT2 standards and raced by Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus in an Experimental Class under the direction of Paolo Garella, former Head of Special Projects at Pininfarina. Ferrari completely distanced itself from the SCG P4/5 Competizione project in 2011, refusing to sell the team parts for vital engine rebuilds between races. The car finished 39th in the 2011 24 Hours Nürburgring (after bursting into flames) and in 2012 won its class and finished 12th overall. ## Specifications\n\nThe Ferrari P4/5 can accelerate from 0-100 kilometres per hour (0-62 mph) in 3.0 seconds (0.14 seconds quicker than the Enzo). It has a top speed of 233 mph (375 km/h). The car has a frontal area of 1.906 square metres (20.52 sq ft) and the sharp nose and smooth curves mean it has a drag coefficient of 0.34. It also weighs 2645 lbs.\n\n ### Interior\n\nThe interior of the P4/5 was designed by Glickenhaus himself with an iPod nano stereo and a tablet PC which features not only GPS but a 3D model of the car as well as a complete parts list and manual for easy servicing. The P4/5 also sports improved air conditioning over the Enzo and a high-strength alloy roll bar redesigned because the original was too thick and obstructed Glickenhaus' view. The seats are custom built, Glickenhaus' and his son's bodies were scanned so Pininfarina could mould the seats for their comfort, accessibility and view of the road (as with race cars). With a frame of carbon fibre composite, the seats are covered with a black mesh and red leather as selected by Glickenhaus' daughter. Pininfarina rearranged the wiring of the car so as to make the car easier to service and 595 lb (270 kg) lighter than the Enzo.\n\n ### Exterior\n\nThe exterior of the car is made entirely of carbon fibre reinforced plastic and is similar in shape to the Ferrari 330 P4 as Glickenhaus requested, however it has been called a \"rolling history of Ferrari-racing-DNA\" sharing elements from several historic Ferrari vehicles, not just the 330 P4. The rear window is similar to that of the Ferrari 512S, the side vents are similar to the Ferrari 330 P3 and the nose is similar to that of the Ferrari 333 SP which improves cooling and the car's frontal crash safety. The butterfly doors (similar to those of the McLaren F1) are designed such that even at 160 mph (260 km/h) there is no wind noise. The improved aerodynamics give the car greater downforce, yet less drag, than the Enzo, which makes the car more stable than the Enzo at high speeds.\n\n ### Powertrain\n\nThe P4/5 has the same engine as the Enzo Ferrari it was built on, a 65°  Ferrari F140 B V12. The 12 cylinders have a total capacity of 5,998 cc (366 cu in), each with 4 valves. The redline at 8200 rpm and the torque of 485 lb⋅ft (658 N⋅m) at 5500  rpm are both the same as the Enzo, but it produces marginally more power with 660 bhp (492 kW; 669 PS) at 7800 rpm. The P4/5 uses the 6  speed automated manual of the Enzo with black shifting paddles behind the wheel. It has two directional indicator buttons, one mounted on each side of the steering wheel.\n\n ### Chassis\n\nMuch of the suspension was unchanged from the original Enzo, with the same push-rod suspension at the front and rear, and the same Brembo carbon-ceramic anti-lock disc brakes with a diameter of 340 mm (13.4 in) at the front and rear. The aluminium alloy wheels are 20 in (510 mm) in diameter, the front tyres have codes of ZR 255/35 and the rear, ZR 335/30.", "h_score": 1653205.06875, "h_score_cat": 6, "pageid": 7658355, "revid": 1173717109, "description": NaN, "categories": ["Cars introduced in 2006", "Ferrari vehicles", "One-off cars", "Pininfarina", "Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicles", "Retro-style automobiles", "Sports cars"], "task": "NEWS_ARTICLE", "creativity_level": "VERY_CREATIVE", "length_words": 100, "blueprint": {"scenario_hook": "A car enthusiast is preparing a feature article on the Ferrari P4/5 by Pininfarina and needs an in-depth overview of its design, performance, and historical context.", "audience": "car enthusiasts, automotive journalists", "intent": "Provide a comprehensive summary covering design evolution, technical specs, and the vehicle’s history for use in a blog or review.", "constraints_soft": ["Emphasize unique design elements over generic Ferrari traits", "Include performance highlights without excessive jargon", "Focus on the collaborative effort between Glickenhaus and Pininfarina", "Mention the car's place within Ferrari’s legacy", "Present information in an engaging yet factual tone"], "seed_topics": ["design evolution", "performance specs", "historical context", "technical details", "designer collaboration"], "tone_hints": ["informative", "professional", "engaging"]}, "quality_checks": {"mentions_wikipedia": false, "has_measurable_constraints": true, "includes_subject": true, "natural_sounding": true}}

Recapture proved unnecessary since the Culver Line and the rest of the BMT and Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) passed into City hands in 1940 as a result of the unification of the three companies. The new connection would create a one-fare ride for IND passengers to Coney Island, and eliminate congestion on the BMT's Fourth Avenue Subway. At the time, the IND had no direct connections to the rest of the subway system. Around 1940, a temporary ramp was installed to connect the underground IND Culver Line to the street-level South Brooklyn Railway, underneath the BMT Culver Line; this connection was used to deliver some IND rolling stock.\n\nThe proposed Culver Ramp, also referred to as the Culver Line Connection, would allow passenger service between the underground Church Avenue and elevated Ditmas Avenue stations. Construction began in June 1941, and was expected to be completed by the end of the year. The ramp was expected to cost \\$2 million, and along with new signals, and rehabilitation of the Culver elevated and lengthening of its stations to IND standards, the total cost of the project was estimated at over \\$11 million. 170 subway cars were purchased for \\$8.5 million for the extension of IND service. Two substations, a signal tower, a fourth track at Ditmas Avenue, and an additional stairway at Ditmas Avenue were all completed as part of the project. McDonald Avenue was also widened between Avenue C and Cortelyou Road to facilitate the ramp.\n\nThough the ramp was nearly complete, including rails and signal work, construction was halted later that year because of America's entrance into World War II. When the project was restarted in 1946, completion was delayed further due to continued material shortages and a lack of rolling stock to facilitate the new service. On October 30, 1954, the connection between the IND Brooklyn Line at Church Avenue and the BMT Culver Line at Ditmas Avenue opened. This allowed IND trains to operate all the way to the Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue terminal.\n\n", "h_score": 1679532.925, "h_score_cat": 6, "pageid": 1480584, "revid": 1172352381, "description": "New York City Subway line", "categories": ["Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation", "Independent Subway System", "New York City Subway lines", "Railway lines opened in 1919"], "task": "NEWS_ARTICLE", "creativity_level": "FACTUAL", "length_words": 100, "blueprint": {"scenario_hook": "A commuter planning a weekend trip to Coney Island wants to understand how the IND Culver Line connects to the rest of NYC’s subway system and what changes have occurred over time.", "audience": "commuters, urban planners, students", "intent": "Provide an overview of the historical integration of the IND Culver Line into the subway network, its current service status, and key milestones without overly technical details.", "constraints_soft": ["Prefer concise explanations", "Avoid excessive jargon", "Include approximate cost figures", "Highlight passenger experience", "Mention major construction phases"], "seed_topics": ["IND Culver Line integration", "Coney Island connection", "historical construction", "service status", "cost estimates"], "tone_hints": ["informative", "friendly", "clear"]}, "quality_checks": {"mentions_wikipedia": false, "has_measurable_constraints": true, "includes_subject": true, "natural_sounding": true}}

Hook in the first post, payoff in the last. Tone: neutral, informative, academic.", "title": "Luan Da", "reference": "### Rise to power The state of Yue was renowned for its mediums, and Luan Da was a fine example. The Shih ji (Records of the Grand Historian) described him as \"tall and a brilliant speaker\", who was \"fertile in techniques\" and a master of esoteric arts, such as shadow play. He was originally a mystic in the court of the emperor's brother, Liu Ji, the Prince of Jiao Dong. Liu Ji's wife had mentioned Luan Da to her brother, the Marquess of Lecheng, Dingyi. Trying to boost his standing with Emperor Wu, Dingyi told the emperor of Shaoweng's far more capable fellow disciple, Luan Da, in 113 BC. Upon their meeting, Emperor Wu inquired into Luan Da and his teacher's powers. In response, Luan Da boasted that he had met immortals. He also claimed that with enough stature and skill, one could create gold, manufacture a means to achieve immortality, dam the Yellow River, and become an immortal. Luan Da then expressed concern at how Shaoweng had been killed, but the excited emperor assured him that the rumours of Shaoweng's execution were false. The emperor, in his enthusiasm, offered Luan Da anything if he would take Shaoweng's place and discover the secret of immortality from his allegedly immortal master. To this, Luan Da replied: > \"Your servant's masters seek nothing of men, it is men who seek of them. If Your Majesty is determined to invite them here, then ennoble your envoys, make them imperial relatives, treat them with courtesy due guests, and do not humble them. Let your envoys each hang their seals of office from their girdles, and then you can send them to converse with spiritual beings. Whether the spiritual beings will accede or not is still uncertain, but if you bestow high honors on your envoys, then they may be induced to come.\" Remembering his experience with Shaoweng, the emperor turned cautious and tested Luan Da; he requested the mystic to display his power. Luan Da set down a Xiangqi board and, while chanting, caused the chess pieces to charge at one another. The emperor was reassured that Luan Da truly had power. The trick was achieved by coating the pieces in a mixture of rooster's blood, iron shavings, and \"magnetic dust\". In Science and Civilisation in China (1986), Joseph Needham discusses the details of this feat and proposed that lodestone was likely used: powdered magnetite would not have been very effective. At that time, the Yellow River was flooding, causing widespread devastation to the people and the rice harvests. As Luan Da had claimed that he could dam the river, Emperor Wu felt that it would be wise to encourage the mystic to take up the task by quickly pleasing him. The emperor granted Luan Da the title of the General of Five Boons, and almost as an afterthought, three other such titles: the General of Heavenly Practitioners, the General of the Earth Practitioners, and General Grand Communicator. Emperor Wu also lavished gifts on him; he was granted the marquisate of Letong, giving him some 2,000 households to rule over, and the emperor also gave him a luxurious mansion, a thousand servants, opulent transportation, many decorations, a seal labelled \"General of Heavenly Way\", and even the hand in marriage of the Eldest Princess Wei, the emperor's eldest daughter, accompanied by a dowry estimated at 10,000 catties of gold. The emperor himself, along with envoys, members of the royal family, and high-ranking officials often invited Luan Da to dine or paid him house calls merely to ask how he was doing. With his marquisate and five generalships, Luan Da had become a man of great standing only a few months after his introduction to the emperor. He was no longer merely Emperor Wu's subject, but an envoy of the immortal beings with status equal to the emperor. In possession of these newly-bestowed honours, Luan Da spent every evening at home, attempting to summon spirits. According to the Shih ji, no spirits appeared, but only \"a multitude of ghosts who gathered around\". These, the text claims, he was able to command. The Shih ji's author, Sima Qian, was scornful of Luan Da, noting that \"Everyone on the seacoast of Yan and Qi began waving their arms about, declaring that they possessed secret arts and could summon spirits and immortal ones.\" Indeed, Luan Da's dramatic growth in reputation and stature became a great topic of discussion in the Han capital of Chang'an, and mystics were eager to imitate his success.", "h_score": 1668359.76875, "h_score_cat": 6, "pageid": 18290870, "revid": 1153618189, "description": "Chinese 2nd-century BC religious figure", "categories": ["112 deaths", "2nd-century BC executions", "Chinese nobility", "Chinese occultists", "Chinese religious leaders", "Executed Han dynasty people", "Han dynasty government officials", "People executed by the Han dynasty", "Year of birth unknown"], "task": "SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD", "creativity_level": "FACTUAL", "length_words": 100, "blueprint": {"scenario_hook": "I’m preparing a lecture on ancient Chinese mystics and want a concise overview of Luan Da’s background and his reputed powers.", "audience": "history students", "intent": "Provide an accessible summary that highlights key aspects of Luan Da's life, achievements, and cultural significance.", "constraints_soft": ["focus on documented historical facts", "avoid speculative claims", "include context of Emperor Wu", "mention mystical techniques like shadow play", "remain neutral tone"], "seed_topics": ["Ancient Chinese mystic", "Luan Da’s influence on Han dynasty", "Shadow play technique", "Emperor Wu's patronage"], "tone_hints": ["informative", "neutral", "academic"]}, "quality_checks": {"mentions_wikipedia": false, "has_measurable_constraints": true, "includes_subject": true, "natural_sounding": true}}

In 1938, mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia studied the feasibility of destroying the Tweed Courthouse after a suggestion from New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses. Under La Guardia's plan, the New York City Court, which occupied the Tweed Courthouse at the time, would move into the recently built New York County Courthouse, but the New York Supreme Court refused to cede any space within the newer courthouse. The Tweed Courthouse was seen as outdated by the 1950s, and the city government filed plans in 1955 to demolish the courthouse as part of the restoration of City Hall Park. It was not until the 1950s, when Henry Hope Reed Jr. wrote about the building, that writers started to argue in favor of the Tweed Courthouse for its historical significance.\n\nSeveral modifications were made to the Tweed Courthouse following its completion. By 1908, Montgomery Schuyler had written that Eidlitz's original rotunda colors had \"been shorn of much of it pristine force, which was much promoted by the tri-colored brickwork\" following the addition of gray paint. Shortly afterward, in 1911 and 1913, elevators were added to the building, and steel-and-iron elevator machinery rooms were built atop the roof. The roof itself was replaced with an iron roof in the early 20th century. In 1927, the County Court moved from the Tweed Courthouse to the recently built New York County Courthouse a few blocks north on Centre Street. Subsequently, the space was occupied by the City Court, with nine justices' chambers being located inside the Tweed Courthouse.\n\nThe original skylight was removed by World War II. The grand steps leading to Chambers Street on the north side were removed to accommodate a widening of that street sometime in the mid-20th century, forcing workers and visitors to enter through the ground floor. Sources disagree on whether this happened in 1940, 1942, or 1955. Architectural writer Donald Reynolds wrote that the staircase's removal \"left the building looking awkward without a proper front\". After the City Court moved out of the courthouse by 1961, the building was occupied by several county offices and the New York Family Court in the 1960s.\n\n ### Preservation\n\n", "h_score": 1678134.76875, "h_score_cat": 6, "pageid": 7547059, "revid": 1166355837, "description": "Historic courthouse in Manhattan, New York", "categories": ["1872 establishments in New York (state)", "1881 establishments in New York (state)", "Civic Center, Manhattan", "County courthouses in New York (state)", "Government buildings completed in 1872", "Government buildings completed in 1881", "Government buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Manhattan", "Leopold Eidlitz buildings", "National Historic Landmarks in Manhattan", "New York City Department of Education", "New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan", "New York City interior landmarks", "New York State Register of Historic Places in New York County"], "task": "INTERNAL_BRIEFING_MEMO", "creativity_level": "HYBRID", "length_words": 100, "blueprint": {"scenario_hook": "I’m preparing a heritage tour guide for New York City and need a comprehensive overview of the Tweed Courthouse’s history, including its architectural changes and preservation efforts.", "audience": "history lovers", "intent": "to gather detailed background on the Tweed Courthouse for a heritage guidebook", "constraints_soft": ["avoid technical jargon", "focus on public interest", "include key events in durable context", "highlight preservation status"], "seed_topics": ["Historical significance", "Demolition attempts", "Architectural modifications", "Preservation status", "Current usage"], "tone_hints": ["informative", "respectful"]}, "quality_checks": {"mentions_wikipedia": false, "has_measurable_constraints": true, "includes_subject": true, "natural_sounding": true}}

They were further told that while \"floodlighting\" the aircraft (in the manner of diffused lighting camouflage for ships) could in theory make it bright enough to match its background, that would require an impossibly large amount of electrical power: but a less power-hungry option was available, namely to use forward-facing lights, and to require the aircraft to fly within 3 degrees of the line directly towards the submarine, so that only its counter-illuminated front would face the enemy.\n\nPilots noted that if they chose a straight-line heading to compensate for a crosswind, the nose of the plane would not point directly at the enemy, but could be, say, 20 degrees off. Since making the beams bright enough at such a wide angle was impracticable, pilots were instructed to keep the nose pointed directly towards the target at all times, resulting in a curving approach path.\n\nThe NDRC estimated that lights could be spaced up to about 4 feet (1.2 m) apart without becoming visible as individual objects at a distance of 2 miles (3.2 km). On this basis, it calculated that a large aircraft like a B-24 Liberator bomber could be camouflaged against the sky for a power consumption of under 500 watts. The key technology investigated under Yehudi was therefore the use of forward-facing lights to anti-submarine and attack aircraft.\n\n ### Ground prototyping\n\nTo improve confidence in the approach, the project made a prototype in the form of a counter-illuminated plywood silhouette of a Liberator at life size, suspended from towers 100 feet (30 m) at a point where it could be seen from a point a little above sea level 2 miles (3.2 km) away across Oyster Bay, Long Island, so that it was seen mainly over water as a sea search aircraft would be from a submarine's conning tower. It was fitted with sealed beam lamps made by General Electric.\n\nThe lamps had reflectors to give them a narrow beam of 3 degrees horizontally, 6 degrees vertically, to minimise power consumption for the required brightness. The lamps' brightness was controllable with a variable resistor. During a test in the winter of 1943, selecting a day when the visibility was above 2 miles (3.2 km) and the wind not so strong as to destroy the prototype, the observers could clearly see the 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick cables used to hold up the model, but the silhouette itself was \"completely invisible\" with the lamps correctly adjusted.\n\n ### Aircraft trials\n\nThe Yehudi project therefore used forward-pointing lamps mounted in the aircraft's nose and the leading edges of the wings, or suspended beneath the wings, their brightness controlled by a circuit containing a pair of photocells to match the brightness of the sky. One photocell pointed at the sky, the other at an auxiliary lamp; the circuit adjusted lamp brightness to make the output from the two photocells equal. It was trialled in Liberators, Avenger torpedo bombers and a Navy glide bomb from 1943 to 1945.\n\nBy directing the light forwards towards an observer (rather than towards the aircraft's skin), the system provided effective and efficient counter-illumination camouflage, more like that of marine animals such as the firefly squid than the Canadian diffused lighting approach. The system never entered active service.\n\n ### Results\n\nIn 1945 a Grumman Avenger with Yehudi lights got within 3,000 yards (2,700 m) of a ship before being sighted, when under the same conditions an uncamouflaged plane was detected at a range of about 12 miles (19 km). It was noted at the time that this would force the enemy either to give up radar silence, making submarines easy to locate but harder to approach, or for observers to use binoculars continually. Since 8x binoculars at the time had a field of view of only 5 degrees, whereas enemy submarines at the surface kept watch with three observers each assigned a 120 degree arc, the camouflage was considered effective.\n\n ## Later developments\n\nThe ability to approach a target unseen was rendered obsolete by advances in radar in the 1940s and 1950s. Since the development of stealth technology, Yehudi lights have attracted renewed interest, first in 1973 when McDonnell Douglas researched a \"Quiet Attack\" aircraft for the Office of Naval Research, modifying the F-4 Phantom with Yehudi lights on its underside, and later in the 1970s when Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works was contracted to develop a stealth aircraft prototype Have Blue, which helped to guide the development of the F-117A stealth attack aircraft and the B-2 stealth bomber.\n\nThe Have Blue prototype was disruptively camouflaged to disguise its shape from casual onlookers, as well as being constructed of angled facets to reduce its radar cross-section. The use of any form of active camouflage, whether Yehudi lights or microwave emissions, was rejected.\n\n ## See also\n\n- Index of aviation articles\n- Active camouflage", "h_score": 1665286.975, "h_score_cat": 6, "pageid": 1232091, "revid": 1169241367, "description": "Active camouflage system prototype for World War II aircraft", "categories": ["Aircraft external lights", "Military camouflage", "Military research", "Prototypes"], "task": "LESSON_PLAN", "creativity_level": "VERY_CREATIVE", "length_words": 100, "blueprint": {"scenario_hook": "A senior aerospace engineer is preparing a proposal to integrate forward‑facing illumination into next‑generation reconnaissance drones, drawing inspiration from WWII Yehudi lights.", "audience": "aerospace engineers, military researchers", "intent": "to detail how Yehudi lights achieved counter‑illumination and assess their applicability for modern stealth platforms.", "constraints_soft": ["focus on power efficiency", "highlight historical lessons", "use technical language"], "seed_topics": ["counter-illumination camouflage", "forward-facing light systems", "energy consumption in aircraft", "stealth technology", "radar cross-section reduction"], "tone_hints": ["technical", "concise", "informative"]}, "quality_checks": {"mentions_wikipedia": false, "has_measurable_constraints": true, "includes_subject": true, "natural_sounding": true}}

Post was commissioned to design a larger structure at 41 Park Row in 1887, and David H. King Jr. was hired as the main builder. Post's new Romanesque building was constructed around the core of the 1858 building, and the printing presses were kept in place. Some 300 people were working in the old building at the time of the project's announcement. Work commenced in January 1888, and foundational work began the next month, though the ceremonial cornerstone was not laid until that June.\n\nThe new building required additional foundations; in some places, these were fused to the existing foundations, while in others, entirely new foundations were added. The office tenants remained in the building until foundation work was completed in May 1888. Afterward, they were evicted and a wooden bridge was erected around the lot's perimeter. The stone walls of the old building were demolished gradually. A passerby was injured during the demolition process when a 1,500-pound (680 kg) stone slab fell from the building's facade. The existing floors were then shored up with wood; the old building's structural stability was retained because its floors rested on a party wall with the Potter Building to the south and on the Spruce Street wall to the north, as well as upon internal partitions. The Spruce Street wall was demolished only after additional floor beams had been installed. Subsequently, holes were cut into the floors so that the columns could be installed and, when enough columns were installed, new iron girders were bolted to these pillars and to the old floors. The new walls were then constructed. Finally, the wooden beams used to shore up the old building were taken away.\n\nWork proceeded nearly constantly, including during the night and weekends, with two 12-hour shifts six days a week, for nine months. To allow the Times's staff to continue working throughout construction, the fourth and fifth floors were covered with a temporary enclosure made of wood and tar-paper. During construction, the Times's offices relocated in November 1888 and in March 1889 to allow builders to finish portions of the new building. The Times reported in April 1889 that it had occupied the new building spaces. By the next month, the facade of the building was completed. 41 Park Row contained 13 floors, excluding a mezzanine level. The Times announced that the new building was 23 feet (7.0 m) taller than the Potter Building. Floor utilization in the new building was similar to that in the old building: the composing room was in the 13th floor, the building's highest, while the editorial offices and city rooms were on the 12th floor.\n\n", "h_score": 1664576.2750000001, "h_score_cat": 6, "pageid": 19717310, "revid": 1149986467, "description": "Office building in Manhattan, New York", "categories": ["1889 establishments in New York (state)", "1905 establishments in New York City", "Buildings and structures completed in 1889", "Buildings and structures completed in 1905", "Civic Center, Manhattan", "Financial District, Manhattan", "Historic district contributing properties in Manhattan", "New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan", "Newspaper headquarters in the United States", "Pace University", "Skyscraper office buildings in Manhattan", "The New York Times"], "task": "NEWS_ARTICLE", "creativity_level": "VERY_CREATIVE", "length_words": 100, "blueprint": {"scenario_hook": "A graduate student in architectural history is preparing a paper on the renovation of the New York Times building at 41 Park Row and wants to gather detailed information about its construction process.", "audience": "architecture students", "intent": "to obtain an overview of the construction, foundation work, and office relocation during the NYT building’s overhaul.", "constraints_soft": ["focus on architectural style and key builders", "include timeline of major milestones", "avoid excessive technical jargon", "highlight safety incidents", "mention structural stability measures"], "seed_topics": ["construction timeline", "Romanesque design", "foundation work", "office relocation", "building height", "stone demolition", "structural stability"], "tone_hints": ["informative", "neutral"]}, "quality_checks": {"mentions_wikipedia": false, "has_measurable_constraints": true, "includes_subject": true, "natural_sounding": true}}

At 01:00, the first of four patrols took off, but the patrol was uneventful, with the pilots reporting clouds at 10,000 feet. A further five patrols were flown to help cover the 4,000 ships that were part of Operation Neptune. On 7 June two of the aircraft were fired upon by friendly Lancaster bombers, who assumed they were hostile. However, No. 410 Squadron claimed its first kill when Flying Officers A. Mcleod and Bob Snowdon destroyed a Junkers Ju 188. On 12 June the squadron claimed multiple bomber kills. The Cougars shot down 14 raiders with five more probably destroyed or damaged.

The film is noted for its 24-minute long take labor scene at the start, dubbed \"The Scene\" by The Guardian's Adrian Horton and described as \"one of the most controversial scenes of the year\" by Entertainment Weekly. Writer Wéber did not anticipate a one-shot take, which Mundruczó planned from the start, though knew she wanted all the details present. Mundruczó began the scene with Martha's first pains and ended with the arrival of an ambulance \"because [they didn't] want to show exactly what's happening\", wanting to leave the audience having only seen the baby alive while creating suspense. As the director, Mundruczó wanted the actors to make their own performance choices in the scene; there were no marks to hit, LaBeouf came up with the bad jokes used himself, and the production team would not show the cast any of the stage performance so as not to influence them. Kirby told Empire that the cast \"had a map of where to be, and then [they would] freefall and see what happened.\" Three crewmembers were used for the scene: director of photography Benjamin Loeb, acting as camera operator upon Mundruczó's request, and two boom operators. A birthing coach, Elan McAllister, had also been brought to the set to assist Kirby and LaBeouf. Loeb chose to shoot the scene with a gimbal as he wanted a \"floaty\" quality to the scene to represent the baby's perspective and felt that using a hand-held camera would make it look too much like a documentary; he also explained the smooth gimbal movement made the scene easier to physically watch, which was something Mundruczó wanted in order to compensate for the potentially-divisive subject matter. Loeb physically trained beforehand so that he would have the strength to carry a gimbal-loaded camera for the whole take, though the shoot still negatively affected his health. The scene was filmed six times over two days, four times on one day and twice the next, with one camera; it was the first scene shot for the film and took up over 30 pages in the script. The choice to use a single take stemmed from the scene in the play and its inclusion of live video. Loeb said that they \"wanted to make sure that the sequence felt like it was presented as a long-winded breath in some ways\". The fourth of the six takes was used; though less technically accurate than the takes on the second day, Mundruczó felt it was more alive. Kirby was glad to be filming the scene in one take, which, while intimidating, meant that she kept the same energy throughout; she said filming the scene was like performing on stage, and that it was \"the best film experience of [her] life\", though it took a long time to come down from the emotions she went through in making it.

Teams reportedly sent players onto the ice to purposefully annoy him by yelling ethnic slurs, hooking, slashing, and holding him as much as possible. Throughout his career, Richard was fined and suspended several times for retaliatory assaults on players and officials, including a \\$250 fine for slapping a linesman in the face less than three months before the March 13, 1955 incident. Richard was considered the embodiment of French-Canadians and was a hero during a time when many perceived themselves as second-class citizens. He was revered when he fought the \"damn English\" during games. In his book, The Rocket: A Cultural History of Maurice Richard, Benoît Melançon compares Richard to Major League Baseball's Jackie Robinson by stating that both players represented the possibility for their minority groups to succeed in North America.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Quebec's industries and natural resources were controlled primarily by English Canadians or Americans. French-speaking Quebecers were the lowest-paid ethnic group in Quebec, which resulted in a sense that control rested with the Anglophone minority. Because of this and other factors, there had been growing discontent in the years before the riot. In early 1954, Richard's teammate, Bernie Geoffrion, was suspended in a move seen as anti-Francophone. Following the suspension, Richard, who had a weekly column in the Samedi-Dimanche newspaper, called President Campbell a \"dictator\" in print. The League in turn forced Richard to retract his statement and discontinue his column. In his 1976 biography of Richard, Jean-Marie Pellerin wrote that his humiliation was shared by all Francophone Quebecers, who were sent running once more by the \"English boot\". This was reflected in a Montreal newspaper's editorial cartoon (pictured), which portrayed Richard as an unruly schoolboy made to write lines by Campbell, shown as the teacher; the cartoon had a deeper meaning as an example of the societal hierarchy that existed between English and French Canadians.\n\n", "h_score": 1668181.8, "h_score_cat": 6, "pageid": 5324396, "revid": 1168239499, "description": "Riot that occurred in Montreal, Quebec, Canada", "categories": ["1950s in Montreal", "1954–55 Montreal Canadiens season", "1954–55 NHL season", "1954–55 in Canadian ice hockey", "1955 in Quebec", "1955 riots", "Boston Bruins games", "History of the Montreal Canadiens", "March 1955 sports events in Canada", "Montreal Canadiens games", "Riots and civil disorder in Canada", "Sports riots", "Violence in ice hockey"], "task": "SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD", "creativity_level": "FACTUAL", "length_words": 100, "blueprint": {"scenario_hook": "I’m looking into how Maurice Richard’s on‑ice actions and public commentary contributed to a major social conflict in Montreal during the 1950s.", "audience": "sports historians", "intent": "Give me an overview of how Richard’s behavior triggered cultural tensions leading to a riot in Quebec.", "constraints_soft": ["Highlight French–English dynamics without specific dates", "Use a neutral tone", "Keep explanation concise"], "seed_topics": ["Maurice Richard", "Montreal Canadiens", "French-Canadian identity", "English dominance", "1950s Quebec", "Cultural conflict"], "tone_hints": ["neutral", "informative"]}, "quality_checks": {"mentions_wikipedia": false, "has_measurable_constraints": true, "includes_subject": true, "natural_sounding": true}}

Though it has been claimed that he was educated at Oxford, there seems to be no support for this. His first patron, however, was the Oxford chancellor Gilbert Middleton, who was also a royal counsellor. When Middleton died in 1331, Edington entered the service of Middleton's friend, Adam Orleton, Bishop of Winchester. Through Orleton, Edington's abilities were brought to the attention of King Edward III, and in 1341 the King named him keeper of the wardrobe. The position was an important one; the wardrobe functioned as the treasury while the King was on campaign, and Edward strongly resisted any attempts to limit this royal prerogative.\n\nThe King must have been impressed by Edington's performance, because in 1344 he made him treasurer of the realm, a position he held for the exceptionally long period of twelve years. This was a job fraught with problems, as the nation was in serious financial difficulties by the mid-1340s. The treasury was in great debt from the heavy demands of the early stages of the Hundred Years' War. By then reneging on his debts, the king had lost public confidence, and struggled to obtain new loans. Edington saw the need to bring all royal expenditure under the oversight of the exchequer. This did not entail controlling the King's use of his resources – a move Edward would have resented greatly – but simply attempting to budget all revenues and expenses.

The battle was fought between Greek and Ottoman forces during the last stages of the First Balkan War, and revolved around the forts of Bizani, which covered the approaches to Ioannina, the largest city in the region.\n\nAt the outbreak of the war, the Hellenic Army on the Epirus front did not have the numbers to initiate an offensive against the German-designed defensive positions in Bizani. However, after the campaign in Macedonia was over, many Greek troops were redeployed to Epirus, where Crown Prince Constantine himself assumed command. In the battle that followed the Ottoman positions were breached and Ioannina taken. Despite having a slight numerical advantage, this was not the decisive factor in the Greek victory. Rather, \"solid operational planning\" by the Greeks was key as it helped them implement a well-coordinated and executed assault that did not allow the Ottoman forces time to react. Furthermore, the bombardment of Ottoman positions was the heaviest in world history up to that time.\n\n ## Background\n\nAs the main war effort of Greece was initially turned towards Macedonia, on the Epirus front the Hellenic Army was outnumbered by the Ottoman Yanya Corps at the outbreak of hostilities in October 1912. After stopping an initial attack by the Ottoman commander Esad Pasha at Gribovo, however, the Greeks succeeded in liberating Preveza (October 21) and pushing north in the direction of Ioannina, repulsing an Ottoman attack at Pente Pigadia (Beshpinar). On November 5, a small force from Corfu made a landing and captured the coastal area of Himarë without facing significant resistance, and on December 20 Greek troops improved their positions in Epirus and entered Korçë, north of Ioannina, thus cutting off its last supply route and threatening the city's northeastern flank.\n\n", "h_score": 1718989.2437500001, "h_score_cat": 7, "pageid": 2390724, "revid": 1171379390, "description": "1913 battle between Greek and Ottoman forces during the First Balkan War", "categories": ["1913 in Greece", "1913 in the Ottoman Empire", "Battles involving the Ottoman Empire", "Battles of the First Balkan War", "Conflicts in 1913", "Constantine I of Greece", "First Balkan War", "History of Ioannina", "Janina vilayet", "March 1913 events", "Modern history of Epirus", "Sieges involving Greece"], "task": "LESSON_PLAN", "creativity_level": "FACTUAL", "length_words": 100, "blueprint": {"scenario_hook": "I am preparing a lecture on early Balkan wars and need detailed insights into the Battle of Bizani.", "audience": "history students", "intent": "to gather comprehensive information about strategic tactics, key outcomes, and significance of the battle.", "constraints_soft": ["focus on military strategy", "include notable commanders", "avoid excessive technical jargon", "provide context without dates", "balance narrative with analysis"], "seed_topics": ["strategic planning", "Ottoman defenses", "Greek offensive", "bombardment intensity", "Ioannina capture", "Crown Prince Constantine"], "tone_hints": ["informative", "analytical"]}, "quality_checks": {"mentions_wikipedia": false, "has_measurable_constraints": true, "includes_subject": true, "natural_sounding": true}}

The first post should hook readers; the last post should provide payoff. Keep tone neutral, informative, straightforward, avoid metaphors or flowery language. Focus on emotional conflict and relationships, keep realistic tone.", "title": "The Blip", "reference": "The Blip (also known as the Decimation and the Snap) is a major fictional event depicted in the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise in which half of all living things in the universe, chosen at random, were exterminated by Thanos snapping his fingers while wearing the Infinity Gauntlet and wielding the Infinity Stones in 2018, and then restored in late 2023 by Bruce Banner using Infinity Stones recovered from different time periods. The Blip appears to refer to the entire event, including the elimination and restoration of the victims. It manifested in the form of the mass disintegration of individual beings into dust, while the reversal had the same dust reforming into the previously deceased individuals, who reappeared in the same location with no direct awareness of what occurred.\n\nAspects of the Blip have been featured in Phase Three, Four, and Five of the MCU, most notably in Avengers: Infinity War (2018), which is when the first snap occurred, and Avengers: Endgame (2019), where the second snap by Banner took place. In addition, a variety of other MCU films and television series have referenced or depicted aspects of the Blip. The consequences of the Blip were substantial and far-reaching. Some were portrayed for comic effects, such as \"blipped\" school band members reappearing in the middle of a basketball game and \"blipped\" characters now being years younger than their own \"unblipped\" previously younger siblings. Others were portrayed for dramatic effect, such as blipped characters returning to general chaos and confusion, finding that loved ones had died in their absence, their homes and life savings were repossessed, and their jobs had been filled by others.\n\nThe Blip inspired the creation of a real-world event on the website Reddit, in which a randomly-selected half of the members of a highly popular subreddit would be banned, simulating the effects of the Blip. The ban of over 300,000 accounts, which included Infinity War co-director Anthony Russo, was the largest in Reddit's history. The Blip, as an event within the MCU, has been compared to the COVID-19 pandemic, as something that has a sustained effect on people all over the world. Since the Blip in Infinity War, many scientific articles have been published analyzing various aspects of the event, including whether it would even be possible for Thanos to snap his fingers while wearing the Infinity Gauntlet.\n\n ## Etymology\n\nFollowing the release of Avengers: Infinity War, the event was dubbed by fans as \"the Snap\", \"the Snappening\", or \"the Snapture\". In the tie-in novel Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War: The Cosmic Quest Volume Two: Aftermath by Brandon T. Snider, the event was referred to as \"the Decimation\", but this naming was not used in any other related media. The event was referred to as \"the Blip\" in Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), but Kevin Feige later clarified that \"the Snap\" referred to Thanos' finger snap in Avengers: Infinity War while \"the Blip\" referred to Bruce Banner's finger snap in Avengers: Endgame. Despite Feige's comments, both events were collectively referred to as \"the Blip\" in MCU projects such as WandaVision (2021) and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021), and the term also appears to reference the five-year gap between the two snaps during which half of Earth's population was wiped from existence. Secret Invasion (2023) uses both \"the Blip\" and \"the Snap\".\n\n ## Known victims and survivors\n\n ### Victims\n\nThe Blip wiped out 50% of all living creatures. Memorials to the \"vanished\" victims were erected in communities across the universe. Among the victims were:\n\n ### Survivors\n\nThose known to have survived the Blip include:\n\n- Ajak\n- Bruce Banner\n- Clint Barton\n- Kate Bishop\n- Sharon Carter\n- Carol Danvers\n- Brad Davis\n- Druig\n- Wilson Fisk\n- Gilgamesh\n- Roger Harrington\n- Tyler Hayward\n- Happy Hogan\n- Howard the Duck\n- Ikaris\n- Kingo\n- Korg\n- Cassie Lang\n- Scott Lang\n- Maya Lopez\n- William Lopez\n- Makkari\n- M'Baku\n- Miek\n- Nakia\n- Karli Morgenthau\n- Nebula\n- Okoye\n- Christine Palmer\n- Phastos\n- Pepper Potts\n- Maria Rambeau\n- Ramonda\n- James Rhodes\n- Rocket\n- Steve Rogers\n- Natasha Romanoff\n- Sersi\n- Sprite\n- Tony Stark\n- Marc Spector\n- Toussaint / T'Challa II\n- Talos\n- Thanos\n- Thena\n- Thor\n- Valkyrie\n- Varra / Priscilla Fury\n- Wong\n\nScott Lang was in the Quantum Realm at the time of the Blip, and although only a few hours passed there from his perspective when he escaped from the Quantum Realm, because time passes slower there, five years had passed everywhere else. However, Lang was believed to have been a victim, due to his absence over those five years.

I want recipe suggestions and cooking tips for authentic Palestinian dishes that reflect the region’s diversity, using locally available ingredients, vegetarian options, simple methods, highlighting traditional flavors, avoiding heavy spices, emphasizing fresh herbs.", "title": "Palestinian cuisine", "reference": "## History\n\nThe region of the southern Levant has a varied past and as such, its cuisine has contributions from various cultures.\n\nAfter the area originally inhabited by Jews, Edomites, Moabites and Ammonites was conquered by the Muslims in the 7th century CE, it became part of a Bilad al-Sham under the name Jund Filastin. Therefore, many aspects of Palestinian cuisine are similar to the cuisine of Syria—especially in the Galilee. Modern Syrian-Palestinian dishes have been generally influenced by the rule of three major Islamic groups: the Arabs, the Persian-influenced Arabs (Iraqis) and the Turks.\n\nThe Arabs that conquered Syria and Palestine initially had simple culinary traditions primarily based on the use of rice, lamb, yogurt and dates. This cuisine did not advance for centuries until the rise of the Abbasid Caliphate, that established Baghdad as its capital and integrated elements of Persian cuisine into the existing Arab cuisine. The Jerusalemite geographer al-Muqaddasi said this of Palestine's foods:\n\n> From Palestine comes olives, dried figs, raisins, the carob fruit... from Jerusalem comes cheeses and the celebrated raisins of the species known as Ainuni and Duri, excellent apples... also pine nuts of the kind called 'Kuraish-bite', and their equal is not found elsewhere... from Sughar and Baysan come dates, the treacle called Dibs.\n\nThe cuisine of the Ottoman Empire—which incorporated Palestine in 1516—was partially made up of what had become, by then a \"rich\" Arab cuisine. After the Crimean War, in 1855, many other communities including Bosnians, Greeks, French and Italians began settling in the area especially in urban centers such as Jerusalem, Jaffa and Bethlehem. These communities' cuisines contributed to the character of Palestinian cuisine, especially communities from the Balkans.\n\nUntil around the 1950s–60s, the main ingredients for rural Palestinian cuisine were olive oil, oregano and bread baked in a simple oven called a taboon. Author G. Robinson Lees, writing in 1905, observed that \"The oven is not in the house, it has a building of its own, the joint property of several families whose duty is to keep it always hot.\"\n\n ## Regional cuisines\n\nThere are three primary culinary regions in historical Palestine - the Galilee, Gaza and the West Bank (which has its own culinary subregions ranging from north to south). In the Galilee, bulgur and meat (beef or lamb) are primary ingredients that are often combined to form several variations of dishes ranging from a family-sized meal to a side dish. However, in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the populations have a cooking style of their own. In the West Bank, meals are particularly heavy and contrast from the foods of the northern Levant. Main dishes involve rice, flatbreads and roasted meats. The staple food of the inhabitants in the Gaza Strip is fish due to its location on the Mediterranean seacoast. Their culinary influences are also strongly affected by traditional Egyptian cooking and chili peppers, dill seeds and garlic the most common seasonings. Although the cuisine is diverse, generally Palestinians are not restricted to the foods of their specific region and there is constant culinary diffusion amongst them. Although, because of Gaza's isolation from other Palestinian and Levantine Arab areas, their cooking styles are less known in the region.\n\n ### Galilee\n\nThe Galilee is highly influenced by Lebanese cuisine, due to extensive communication between the two regions before the establishment of Israel. The Galilee specializes in a number of meals based on the combination of bulgur, spices and meat, known as kibbee by Arabs. Kibbee bi-siniyyeh\\|Kibbee bi-siniyee is a combination of minced lamb or beef mixed with pepper, allspice and other spices wrapped in a bulgur crust, then baked. Kibee bi-siniyee could serve as the main dish during a Palestinian lunch. Kibbee neyee is a variation of kibee that is served as raw meat mixed with bulgur and a variety of spices. It is mostly eaten as a side dish and pita or markook bread is used for scooping the meat. Its leftovers are usually cooked as a different meal the next day, such as fried kibbee balls.\n\nA specific rice meal, called pilaf, is common in the Galilee and consists of a mixture of rice with chopped lamb and pine nuts flavored with an assortment of spices, accompanied by a lamb leg or whole chickens. In addition, a variety of dishes made up of meatballs and potatoes are eaten during special occasions. Shish kebab or lahme mashwi and shish taouk are grilled meats on skewers and are commonly eaten after an array of appetizers known as the mezze.\n\n", "h_score": 1730004.225, "h_score_cat": 7, "pageid": 11146241, "revid": 1158965701, "description": "Types of food in Palestine culture", "categories": ["Arab cuisine", "Cuisine by ethnicity", "Levantine cuisine", "Mediterranean cuisine", "Middle Eastern cuisine", "Palestinian cuisine"], "task": "NEWS_ARTICLE", "creativity_level": "FACTUAL", "length_words": 100, "blueprint": {"scenario_hook": "I’m planning a family dinner in my apartment and want to showcase authentic Palestinian dishes that reflect the region’s diversity.", "audience": "Home cooks", "intent": "Provide recipe suggestions and cooking tips for authentic Palestinian cuisine.", "constraints_soft": ["Use locally available ingredients", "Include vegetarian options", "Keep simple cooking methods", "Highlight traditional flavors", "Avoid heavy spices", "Emphasize fresh herbs"], "seed_topics": ["Galilee kibbee variations", "West Bank rice dishes", "Gaza seafood recipes", "Traditional bread baking", "Olive oil usage", "Seasoning with oregano and dill"], "tone_hints": ["warm", "informative", "friendly"]}, "quality_checks": {"mentions_wikipedia": false, "has_measurable_constraints": true, "includes_subject": true, "natural_sounding": true}}

Heading southbound, this junction is signed as exit S4. The parkway proceeds northward through the town of Islip as a four-lane divided highway, passing through residential parts of the adjacent hamlet of Brentwood to reach exit S3, a partial cloverleaf interchange with Pine Aire Drive. Just north of the junction, the highway passes over the Main Line of the Long Island Rail Road. Continuing northward through Islip, the Sagtikos Parkway leaves Brentwood ahead of exit S2, a connection to County Route 13 (CR 13, named Crooked Hill Road). The southbound exit serves CR 13 by way of access roads through the Pilgrim Psychiatric Center while the northbound direction uses part of G Road to reach CR 13 and Suffolk County Community College's Grant Campus.\n\nPast the exit, the Sagtikos State Parkway crosses under CR 13 and immediately enters exit S1, a large modified cloverleaf interchange with the Long Island Expressway (Interstate 495 or I-495). The junction brings the parkway into the town of Smithtown, where it bends northwestward and parallels CR 67 (Vanderbilt Motor Parkway) for a half-mile (0.8 km) through the town's Commack section. CR 67 eventually turns westward to pass over the Sagtikos Parkway, at which point the parkway curves back to the north and enters exit SM1E, a cloverleaf interchange serving as the Northern State Parkway's exit 44.

Ronald Paulson suggests that the model for Moll Hackabout in Hogarth's first scene is Ann Bond, who was lured by Needham and raped by Charteris. Charteris, already known as the \"Rape-Master General\", was convicted and sentenced to death as a result of the Bond rape, although he was later pardoned. Needham's name was not mentioned during the legal proceedings. Needham may have introduced Charteris to Sally Salisbury around 1708. Salisbury was the pre-eminent prostitute of the day and was kept by Charteris for a short time as mistress at the beginning of her career. When her previous bawd, Mother Wisebourne, died in 1719, she became a member of Needham's household and brought with her a clientele from the highest ranks of society. Salisbury brought further fame to Needham's house by involving another of her girls in the theft of the Earl of Cardigan's clothes. The two women accompanied him to Newmarket where he became drunk, and after putting him to bed at an inn they stole his clothes and jewellery and returned to London. The Earl treated the matter as a joke. Some idea of the reputation of Needham's house can be gathered from one of Joe Miller's Jests, which involves her asking her landlord to wait for his money until Parliament and the Convocation sit, at which point she will be able to pay him ten times over, and by a satirical premature obituary, which appeared in the London Journal. The latter describes a will in which she distributes appropriate gifts to her famous clients: \"a picture of Sodom and Gomorrah to indorsing D―n; an ounce of Mercuris Dulcis to Beau C―e, of St. Martin's Lane; her estate to the Duke of Wharton; her library to Ned C―; and a receipt to cure a clap to little Quibus\". At the time, the figures mentioned would not have been spared their blushes by the omission of their full names, but identifying them now is guesswork. Her well-connected clientele may have allowed her to escape arrest. Despite the popular notion that Sally Salisbury's 1723 stabbing of John Finch, the son of the Duchess of Winchelsea, had taken place in her house (it had actually occurred at the Three Tuns Tavern in Covent Garden), the first time Needham was raided was in 1724: > Yesterday morning the celebrated Mother Needham and Mother Bird, two eminent conservators of the Game of the Kingdom, were committed to Newgate; their houses being disturb'd the night before by the Constables, who disengaged the Gentlemen and Ladies to a great number, and carried them to the Round-House. This being the first time Mrs Needham ever received publick correction, since her being at the head of venal affairs in this town, 'tis thought will be the ruin of her household. Daily Journal, Tuesday 21 July 1724. The constables had found \"two women in bed with two men of distinction\". The men were bound over, but the women were sent to Tothill Fields Bridewell to do hard labour. Needham's punishment on this occasion is not recorded, but it appears that she was still incarcerated in September when her house burned down, killing one of the inhabitants, Captain Barbute, a French officer. In 1728, several of her girls were arrested, but she appears to have escaped punishment.", "h_score": 1702498.65625, "h_score_cat": 7, "pageid": 20868375, "revid": 1023048082, "description": "English procuress and brothel-keeper", "categories": ["1731 deaths", "17th-century births", "18th-century English businesspeople", "18th-century English businesswomen", "English brothel owners and madams"], "task": "INTERNAL_BRIEFING_MEMO", "creativity_level": "HYBRID", "length_words": 100, "blueprint": {"scenario_hook": "I’m drafting a research paper on how 18th‑century London brothels influenced political elites, and I need a concise overview of Elizabeth Needham’s operations.", "audience": "Academic researchers", "intent": "Summarize Elizabeth Needham’s business activities, clientele connections, legal challenges, and reputation in the early 1700s.", "constraints_soft": ["Provide context without detailed dates", "Focus on key relationships with prominent figures", "Include any notable incidents or rumors", "Maintain neutral tone"], "seed_topics": ["Elizabeth Needham brothel", "High-profile clientele", "Legal persecution", "Reputation controversies", "Connections to Duke of Wharton", "Sally Salisbury involvement"], "tone_hints": ["Neutral", "Informative", "Professional"]}, "quality_checks": {"mentions_wikipedia": false, "has_measurable_constraints": true, "includes_subject": true, "natural_sounding": true}}

The Japanese knew that the Chinese would not be able to fulfil their demands within the stated timeframe. Instead, their issuance was designed to raise the morale of Japanese troops, cow the Chinese, and demonstrate the \"determination\" of the Japanese military to foreigners. As expected, the demands were viewed as humiliating and unacceptable by the Chinese. In response, Chiang, who had left the area, sent a courier to the Japanese garrison, stating that he would meet some, but not all of the stated demands. Fukuda, who deemed that his demands had not been met, launched a full-scale attack on the Chinese in Jinan in the afternoon of 8 May. Fighting was fiercest on the night of 9–10 May, with the Japanese using artillery to bombard the old walled city, where the remaining NRA troops had holed up. The civilian population of the old city were not warned in advance of the Japanese bombardment, which is thought to have resulted in many casualties. The final group of Chinese soldiers escaped under the cover of night on 10–11 May. By morning, the Japanese had gained full control of Jinan, and took up positions in the walled city. The city would remain under Japanese occupation until March 1929, when an agreement to settle the dispute over Jinan was reached.

The song's popularity led to Dylan recording it live many times, and it has been included in multiple compilation albums. It has been translated into other languages and has been used or referenced in television shows, films, and books.\n\nThe song has been performed and recorded by many artists, including the Byrds, Judy Collins, Melanie, Odetta, and Stevie Wonder among others. The Byrds' version was released in April 1965 as their first single on Columbia Records, reaching number 1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart, as well as being the title track of their debut album, Mr. Tambourine Man. The Byrds' recording of the song was influential in popularizing the musical subgenres of folk rock and jangle pop, leading many contemporary bands to mimic its fusion of jangly guitars and intellectual lyrics in the wake of the single's success. Dylan himself was partly influenced to record with electric instrumentation after hearing the Byrds' reworking of his song.\n\nDylan's song has four verses, of which the Byrds only used the second for their recording. Dylan's and the Byrds' versions have appeared on various lists ranking the greatest songs of all time, including an appearance by both on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 best songs ever. Both versions received Grammy Hall of Fame Awards.\n\nThe song has a bright, expansive melody and has become famous for its surrealistic imagery, influenced by artists as diverse as French poet Arthur Rimbaud and Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini. The lyrics call on the title character to play a song and the narrator will follow. Interpretations of the lyrics have included a paean to drugs such as LSD, a call to the singer's muse, a reflection of the audience's demands on the singer, and religious interpretations.\n\n ## Composition\n\n\"Mr. Tambourine Man\" was written and composed in early 1964, at the same approximate time as \"Chimes of Freedom\", which Dylan recorded later that spring for his album Another Side of Bob Dylan. Dylan began writing and composing \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" in February 1964, after attending Mardi Gras in New Orleans during a cross-country road trip with several friends, and completed it sometime between the middle of March and late April of that year after he had returned to New York. Nigel Williamson has suggested in The Rough Guide to Bob Dylan that the influence of Mardi Gras can be heard in the swirling and fanciful imagery of the song's lyrics. Journalist Al Aronowitz has stated that Dylan completed the song at his home, but folk singer Judy Collins, who later recorded the song, has stated that Dylan completed the song at her home. Dylan premiered the song the following month at a May 17 concert at London's Royal Festival Hall.\n\n", "h_score": 1845263.8125, "h_score_cat": 8, "pageid": 586330, "revid": 1166928360, "description": "1965 song by Bob Dylan", "categories": ["1965 singles", "1965 songs", "Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles", "Bob Dylan songs", "Cashbox number-one singles", "Columbia Records singles", "Glen Campbell songs", "Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients", "Irish Singles Chart number-one singles", "Jangle pop songs", "Number-one singles in South Africa", "Song recordings produced by Terry Melcher", "Song recordings produced by Tom Wilson (record producer)", "Songs about musical instruments", "Songs about musicians", "Songs written by Bob Dylan", "The Byrds songs", "UK Singles Chart number-one singles"], "task": "LESSON_PLAN", "creativity_level": "FACTUAL", "length_words": 100, "blueprint": {"scenario_hook": "I'm preparing a themed playlist for my upcoming college music club event, and I want to include classic folk songs that inspire creative reinterpretations.", "audience": "college students", "intent": "I need ideas on how to remix \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" into a modern indie track while preserving its lyrical essence.", "constraints_soft": ["focus on original folk-rock vibe", "avoid heavy electric guitars", "include subtle psychedelic references", "keep lyrics poetic"], "seed_topics": ["folk rock influence", "song lyric analysis", "cover versions", "historical significance", "modern reinterpretation"], "tone_hints": ["informative", "creative", "nostalgic"]}, "quality_checks": {"mentions_wikipedia": false, "has_measurable_constraints": true, "includes_subject": true, "natural_sounding": true}}

VH1 also produced a brief spoof documentary in the style of Behind the Music titled \"Rock Band Cometh: The Rock Band Band Story,\" documenting a fictional band that plays the game.\n\nThe game appeared in demo kiosks at Best Buy, Wal-Mart, and Sam's Club stores. The demo contained 15 songs and supports gameplay for all 4 instruments (although the actual in-store setup varied). The demo's drum set lacked a bass pedal, with the game automatically playing bass drum notes.\n\nOther companies helped to promote Rock Band through free and reduced cost downloadable content. Best Buy offered two free downloadable tracks by the band Disturbed for customers that pre-ordered their Indestructible album online; these tracks were made available to all users in June 2008 for \\$0.99/80MSP. McDonald's sponsored a month-long program that reduced the cost of two selected downloadable tracks to \\$1 (approximately half the standard cost) for each week during the month of May 2008 as part of their Dollar Menu promotion.\n\nThe United Kingdom release of the game took place in London, where a number of bands including The Automatic, The Whip, and The Courteeners performed short sets.\n\n ### Editions\n\nThe \"Special Edition\" bundle includes the game software, as well as guitar, drum, and microphone peripherals. The PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and Wii bundles include a wireless guitar, whereas the Xbox 360 bundle contains a wired guitar (a separate wireless guitar is currently available for the Xbox 360). Initially, a USB hub was only included in the Xbox 360, Wii, and PlayStation 2 bundles, in order to increase the number of available USB ports on the console. The more recent PlayStation 3 bundles now include a USB hub, with a sticker on the box indicating so. MTV originally announced Rock Band would be released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on November 23, 2007, Black Friday, one of the busiest shopping days in the United States. However, the release date was eventually moved to November 20, 2007.\n\nThe game software was made available for purchase individually at the game's launch, allowing players with a USB microphone or a compatible guitar controller to take advantage of the vocals, lead guitar, and bass guitar gameplay. Individual Rock Band-branded instruments became available in retail stores later, starting with the drum kit on February 12, 2008. An individual wireless guitar became available on April 8, 2008.\n\nOn April 8, 2008, EA announced a timed Xbox 360 exclusive for a partial European launch, with other versions to follow later in the summer.\n\n", "h_score": 1794983.08125, "h_score_cat": 8, "pageid": 10422767, "revid": 1172848844, "description": "2007 music video game", "categories": ["2007 video games", "Cooperative video games", "D.I.C.E.

Please follow these rules.", "title": "Union Bank of Switzerland", "reference": "## Merger with Swiss Bank Corporation During the mid-1990s, UBS came under fire from dissident shareholders, critical of bank's relatively conservative management and lower return on equity. Martin Ebner, through his investment trust, BK Vision became the largest shareholder in UBS and attempted to force a major restructuring of the bank's operations. The battles between Ebner and UBS management proved a distraction to the bank in the mid-1990s. Looking to take advantage of the situation, Credit Suisse approached UBS about a merger that would have created the second largest bank in the world in 1996. UBS's management and board unanimously rebuffed the proposed merger. Ebner, who supported the idea of a merger, led a major shareholder revolt that resulted in the replacement of UBS's chairman, Robert Studer. Studer's successor Mathis Cabiallavetta would be one of the key architects of the merger with Swiss Bank Corporation. On 8 December 1997, Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation announced an all-stock merger. At the time of the merger, Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation were the second and third largest banks in Switzerland, respectively both trailing Credit Suisse. Discussions between the two banks had begun several months earlier, less than a year after rebuffing Credit Suisse's merger overtures. The all-stock merger resulted in the creation UBS AG, a huge new bank with total assets of more than US\\$590 billion. Also referred to as the \"New UBS\" to distinguish itself from the former Union Bank of Switzerland, the combined bank became the second largest in the world, at that time, behind only the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. Additionally, the merger pulled together the banks' various asset management businesses to create the world's largest money manager, with approximately US\\$910 billion in assets under management. The merger, which was billed as a merger of equals, resulted in UBS's shareholders receiving 60% of the combined company and Swiss Bank's shareholders receiving the remaining 40% of the bank's common shares. UBS's Mathis Cabiallavetta became chairman of the new bank while Swiss Bank's Marcel Ospel was named chief executive officer. However, it quickly became evident that from a management perspective, it was Swiss Bank that was buying UBS as nearly 80% of the top management positions were filled by legacy Swiss Bank professionals. Additionally, UBS professionals suffered more headcount reductions, particularly in the investment banking unit where there were heavy cuts in the corporate finance and equities businesses. The more severe cuts at UBS were an acknowledgment that prior to the merger Swiss Bank Corporation had built a global investment banking business, Warburg Dillon Read through its acquisitions of Dillon Read in New York and S. G. Warburg in London. Swiss Bank was generally considered to be further along than UBS in developing its international investment banking business, particularly in the higher margin advisory businesses where Warburg Dillon Read was considered to be the more established platform. UBS, on the other hand had a stronger retail and commercial banking business in Switzerland and both banks had notably strong asset management capabilities. After the merger was completed, it was widely speculated that a series of losses suffered by UBS on its equity derivative positions in late 1997 was a contributing factor in pushing UBS management to consummate the merger. It would become clear that the derivatives losses prompted UBS to accept the terms proposed by Swiss Bank more readily than they otherwise would have. ## The company\n\nPrior to its merger with Swiss Bank Corporation, UBS operated as a full-service bank and a provider of wholesale financial services through its retail banking, commercial banking, investment banking, asset management and wealth management businesses. In 1997, prior to its merger with Swiss Bank Corporation, UBS operated 275 branches in Switzerland and 82 branches, subsidiaries and representative offices outside Switzerland. The company had approximately 27,611 employees, of which 19,355 worked in Switzerland and the remaining 8,256 employees were outside Switzerland. The bank had total assets of nearly CHF578 billion and shareholders' equity of nearly CHF28 billion as of the end of 1997.\n\n ## History\n\n", "h_score": 1788010.08125, "h_score_cat": 8, "pageid": 191975, "revid": 1170848340, "description": "Swiss investment bank and financial services company", "categories": ["Banks disestablished in 1998", "Banks established in 1912", "Defunct banks of Switzerland", "Financial services companies disestablished in 1998", "Financial services companies established in 1912", "Former investment banks", "Swiss companies disestablished in 1998", "Swiss companies established in 1912", "UBS"], "task": "SOCIAL_MEDIA_THREAD", "creativity_level": "FACTUAL", "length_words": 100, "blueprint": {"scenario_hook": "Hi, I'm preparing a presentation on European banking mergers and I want a concise overview of how the Union Bank of Switzerland merged with Swiss Bank Corporation in the late 1990s.", "audience": "finance professionals, students", "intent": "to obtain a summary of the merger and its key impacts.", "constraints_soft": ["avoid jargon", "use plain language", "include key outcomes"], "seed_topics": ["merger history", "asset management consolidation", "investment banking changes", "corporate leadership shifts", "financial metrics post-merger"], "tone_hints": ["informative", "professional"]}, "quality_checks": {"mentions_wikipedia": false, "has_measurable_constraints": true, "includes_subject": true, "natural_sounding": true}}
